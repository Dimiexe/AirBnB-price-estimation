29973286,414583236,2019-02-20,28155995,Tijana,"We had perfect experience both with the apartment and our hosts! The apartment is super cozy, perfectly equipped, super clean and warm! Despite the description, the fact is that it has heating system and it works very good! There is also always hot water available. The hosts are super nice and helpful, reacting in a minute, responsive all the time. Location is pretty good, walking distance from Acropolis and city center.  I will totally recommend this apartment for a pleasant stay in Athens!:)"

29973286,449198294,2019-05-06,120126291,Maria,"The apartment is really nice - stylish, with new furniture, plenty of towels, not far from the metro stations and Acropolis. There is a big supermarket in 3 minutes walk and several cafes and restaurants near. <br/>Disadvantages -  a basketball playground across the street, it has been noisy sometimes."
29973286,449970062,2019-05-08,44659898,Dragoș,"Everything was as we expected! Great services, good communication, cozy apartment, great location, close to city center! You also have a supermarket at 3 min walk!"

Beautiful views from the balcony. Sparkling clean and comfortable apartment. Hosts were very responsive and were very helpful with suggestions for things to do, see, and where to eat in the area. Two great restaurants just steps away from the apartment- which we truly enjoyed! (Also- a hair dryer is provided!)"
29973286,455770982,2019-05-20,40771390,Selina Andrea,Lovely appartement close to the Acropolis. We had a great stay. Thank you

29973286,464725661,2019-06-06,134407638,Vina,"homm place is very comfortable to live in, we stay here for four days. <br/>we loves the bed becouse very comfortable so we slept well. Kitchen utensils are also very complete. we cook breakfast every day. Very nice.<br/>if we go back to Athens we will come back here. this place is value for money"
29973286,467854071,2019-06-11,76489082,Audrey,Le logement est bien situé et très propre. Il correspond parfaitement aux photos. Très bon séjour au sein de cet appartement.
29973286,472244491,2019-06-19,206819508,Wim,Het is een geweldig en luxueus appartement. Van alle gemakken voorzien  en brandschoon bij aankomst. Wifi was prima en de smart tv geweldig. Ook het bed en met name de matras (wat ik zelf erg belangrijk vind) is prima van kwaliteit! Dat heb ik wel eens anders meegemaakt. Kortom een echte aanrader als je naar Athene gaat. Het metrostation Sygrou-fix is maar 8 minuten lopen en dan zit je met twee haltes in het centrum. Lopend is het een kwartiertje naar de Acropolis. Kortom ideaal gelegen en ook prima rustig. (klein) balkonnetje met uitzicht op Acropolis! Heerlijk om even te zitten na een dagje stad. <br/>Ook het feit dat de eigenaren vrijwel direct reageren op vragen of suggesties is perfect. Maakt de communicatie vlot en vriendelijk. Wij gaan hier nog wel naar terug!
29973286,475454329,2019-06-24,185043616,Christophe,"We had a lovely stay in Athena. The flat was well located, less than 10 minutes walk from metro station, less than 5 minutes walk from supermarket and about 100m from a very nice local restaurant which we highly recommend. The only little disappointment was the AC in the bedroom which did not work properly during our stay but otherwise everything was perfect !"
29973286,478678730,2019-06-30,234183353,Georgia,The apartment location is a 15 minute walk from the acropolis and the acropolis museum and a similar walk to Plaka. The apartment was just like in the photos and nicely air-conditioned. The “lime” scooters in town (which you can download an app to sign up) are great for getting about and are fun and cheap too! There were also 2 or 3 restaurants very near the apartment which I would highly recommend which are less touristy than those in Plaka. A 30 second walk from the apartment is a fantastic souvlaki shop where you can get a scrumptious pork or chicken wrap for only €2.20 - cannot recommend highly enough! Thanks for reading.
29973286,480603124,2019-07-03,62817486,Pierre,"Nous conseillons vivement ce logement pas très éloigné des quartier sympa d'Athènes, à 20 min à pieds de l'acropole et dans un quartier calme quand il n'y a pas de travaus sur le toit de l'école en face de l'appart.<br/>L'appart est parfait, propre et très bien équipé."
29973286,482154300,2019-07-06,160612722,Hannah,"A very clean and cool place with really good amenities for cooking, and lots of storage for clothes and luggage. Lots of space for two people. <br/><br/>About a 30 minute walk into the centre of Athens, which meant it was quiet for the night when you wanted to rest, or relax on the balcony, but you are still close to the city, and there are also good restaurants on the next street, plus a bakery and supermarket very close by.<br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay in this apartment."
29973286,484090745,2019-07-08,70196250,Rob,The apartment was clean and very well kept. Modern renovation and nice touches which are appreciated after long days exploring Athens in the heat!
29973286,490150047,2019-07-18,144973903,Adina,"We loved the place, there is no other way to put it! It was super clean, it has great amenities, it's super close to the city center, yet tucked away on a quiet street. The view was perfect, the check-in and check out were super easy and the communication was pretty much instant. 5/5 stars, it was perfect and I fully recommend it."
29973286,493772061,2019-07-23,76201906,Ana,"El apartamento es tal cual se muestra en las fotos, es cómodo, está limpio y todo nuevo. Dispone de una cocina equipada, incluso lavadora. <br/>Todo muy recomendable."

29973286,502789567,2019-08-05,126153308,Fernando,"Nice apartment to visit Athens for a few days. 15 minutes walking to the center, a big supermarket closer. Great experience"
29973286,505256339,2019-08-09,44119570,Andrea,"Homm's place is amazing. It is a lovely apartment with incredible view of the acropolis, nice balcony,very clean and modern. Communication with the host was easy and quick and self check in was also available since we arrived late at night. Recommended!"
29973286,513793356,2019-08-20,4861799,Franky,The apartment is nicely renovated and very clean. Thank you
29973286,516196520,2019-08-24,79470469,Fabrice,"Super séjour à Athènes dans cet appartement ! <br/>Plutôt bien situé, à 15min à pied du musée de l’Acropole et à 20min de Plaka, attention (comme partout à Athènes) ça grimpe ! Juste à côté d’un grand supermarché. <br/>Bonnes adresses fournies par l’hôte (très belle expérience au 360 dégrée bar). <br/>Excellent rapport qualité prix, allez y les yeux fermés !"
29973286,518674736,2019-08-27,87081174,Yana,"Stylish space with nice touches. Balcony view was lovely. A little bit of a walk to the center, but nice if you wanna be away from tourists. <br/><br/>2 great restaurants nearby"
29973286,524067638,2019-09-05,184032328,Olga,"Апартаменты отличные, чисто, уютно, все соответствует фотографиям. Все новое, в хорошем состоянии, есть вся необходимая посуда. Однако обратите внимание, в ванной довольно низкие потолки, если вы выше 180 см, то вряд ли вы сможете там встать в полный рост. В остальном помещении потолки высокие."
29973286,527085802,2019-09-10,97769741,Paloma,"Apartamento muy cómodo a 15-20 minutos andando del centro de Atenas. Decoración simple pero bonita, con todo lo necesario para pasar unas buenas vacaciones. Está en un barrio residencial de clase media, con un par de restaurantes muy buenos y un supermercado a menos de 5 minutos a pie. Tiene aire acondicionado, ventiladores y Smart tv  La relación calidad-precio es muy buena. Lo único negativo podría ser que el techo del baño es un poco bajo (si no mides más de 1,83 no debería ser un problema) y que la cama no estaba hecha cuando llegamos (aunque había sábanas limpias). Recomendable 100%"
29973286,531300182,2019-09-17,125478019,Per,Flot lejlighed

29973286,543151859,2019-10-07,82864175,Radek,"Sparkling clean, modern flat with all amenities such as air conditioning, fully equipped kitchen, WiFi and washing machine. Excellent place, highly recommend"
29973286,545959829,2019-10-13,23310944,Anatolij,"We had a very good stay at the apartment. The apartment itself was very clean and had a nice, modern feel to it. The view on the Akropolis is amazing! The area is quiet and residential, a supermarket is just around the corner. Note that the apartment is about 15min walk to the nearest metro station and 25-40min walk to anything of interest (Acropolis being the closest one, Ancient Agora, Plaka, museums, Psiri, ...) and that you'll be walking along some crowded, noisy roads full of cars (they do have pedestrian paths and traffic lights to cross though). We didn't end up buying a metro ticket, since it would have taken just as much time to walk anywhere, but we did walk a lot (which was also good and our iPhone step counter was happy :) ). Also note that when you book the place, you'll be communicating with a company, not a private host. The communication was quick and professional, however, most of the email responses felt sort of pre-fabricated and I often needed to ask several times to get an actual answer to my questions. That being said, the people were very helpful and accommodating. Overall, we can recommend this place for a stay in Athens, we had a wonderful time"
29973286,554345615,2019-10-26,82594125,Henry,Neat place in a great location. I hope to stay again on my next visit to Athens.
29973286,559460745,2019-11-04,239852161,Branko,"Great apartment for enjoying the holiday in Athens, close to the cultural spots and in the quiet street what is really good for Athens, the view is great, like the standard of the place itself"
29973286,568909241,2019-11-25,77026411,Nikhil,Excellent apartment. Clean and modern. Also it is just 20 mins walking distance to the main tourist attractions. There are also several restaurants nearby for you to satisfy your cravings
29973286,572612242,2019-12-03,291877324,Kelly,"Εξαιρετικός χώρος !! Η τοποθεσία άποψη , εξαιρετική θέα και πολύ καθαρό σπίτι !"
29973286,581238213,2019-12-24,11538387,Maria,"Great apartment, super cute, comfortable and clean. Ten minutes walking distance to the Acropolis and the Panathinaikon stadium. When I checked in the heating wasn’t working and the company send immediately someone to take a look. In a couple of days the whole thing was sorted. The host is very responsive and they always get back to my messages within a few minutes. I enjoyed my stay and I would definitely stay here again."

Το σπίτι μέσα καθαρό τρομερό κρεβάτι άνετο . Το μόνο πρόβλημα που είχα είναι ότι δεν υπήρχε ζεστό Νερό . Εύχομαι να το λύσουν γρήγορα για τους επόμενους πελάτες . Γτ αξίζει σαν σπίτι .

29973286,648555295,2020-08-09,148833547,Bas,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay. The apartment is exactly as described in the ad: bright, modern, clean and equipped with literally everything you could possibly need during an Athens getaway. The apartment is located in a wonderful and quiet residential area, close to public transportation and super close to a big supermarket.<br/><br/>This was the second Homm property we rented and like last time we once again enjoyed outstanding service. No matter what time of the day, they always respond within minutes and the few small issues we had were taken care of either the same day or early in the morning the day after. <br/><br/>Definitely one to recommend and to come back to one day. Thanks for everything!"
29973286,650770243,2020-08-14,117157211,Magdalena,"Thank You for your great located and very well equipped flat, we enjoyed especially the ventilators, the fully equipped and beutiful kitchen and the balcony with the view to Acropolis. We recommend your flat and would like to come again :)"
29973286,657703337,2020-08-29,54165522,Katie,"This was a really lovely apartment for our time in Athens. Very close to the Acropolis and the First Cemetery of Athens. Lovely balcony with a view of the acropolis to relax on after a day of exploring,  and air conditioning for those hot summer nights. Great kitchen for cooking,  but if you can't be bothered we had the best gyros we've ever had right next door!"
29973286,660058813,2020-09-04,198695253,Pauline,"Appartement parfait propre avec des équipements en très bon état , à 10 bonnes minutes à pied du métro dans un quartier plutôt calme avec petite vue sur l’acropole même si c’est loin.<br/>La climatisation dans la pièce principale et dans la chambre est bien appréciable."

29973286,668334029,2020-09-27,128186663,Basma,Un magnifique appartement pas loin du centre ville.<br/>J’ai adoré la décoration et la bienveillance de l’hôte.<br/>Il y’a tout ce qu’il vous fait pour passer un très bon séjour <br/>Je le recommande vivement ❤️
29973286,672808628,2020-10-10,206819508,Wim,"Voor ons de tweede keer dat we er waren. Het appartement is nog steeds heel mooi en van alle gemakken voorzien zoals tv, wifi, mooie keuken en wasmachine. Wees echter wel alert op het feit dat het appartement direct tegenover een kinderopvang en school staat. Doordeweeks overdag dus altijd het gegil en geschreeuw van kleine kinderen. Als je de hele dag op pad bent geen probleem maar als je even overdag op het balkon wilt zitten behoorlijk lawaaierig en storend. Ook de nieuw geplaatste lichtmasten voor de basketbalveldjes naast de school geven 's avonds tot 22.45 fel licht. Ook op je balkon waardoor je niet meer goed de contouren en de lichtjes van de stad kunt zien plus altijd gestuiter van basketballen en schreeuwende jongeren.. Voor hen perfect dat ze veel kunnen sporten maar als bewoner (voor ons) wel jammer van de plek. Als je tenminste af en toe ook wat rust wilt."
29973286,706364471,2020-11-03,245771107,Doris,Nett eingerichtetes sauberes Apartment mit viel Stauraum und guter Ausstattung. Für einen längeren Aufenthalt sehr gut geeignet.

29973286,719058205,2020-12-28,327808908,Ευγενία,"Το διαμέρισμα ήταν πολύ ωραίο, ίδιο με τις φωτογραφίες, καθαρό. Το μοναδικό μειονέκτημα για εμάς ήταν πως τη θέα της Ακρόπολης εμπόδιζε ένας προβολέας από το σχολείο δίπλα ο οποίος ήταν ανοιχτός μέχρι κάποια ώρα το βράδυ. Παρόλα αυτά η θέα ήταν απολαυστική."
29973286,725151771,2021-01-18,281631651,Αννα Μαρια,πολύ ωραίο διαμέρισμα και το πιο βασικό είναι ότι είναι πολύ καθαρό!! άψογη επικοινωνία και άμεσες απαντήσεις

Μεγάλο και άνετο κρεβάτι, η κουζίνα πλήρως εξοπλισμένη, με smart tv, θέα Ακρόπολη και Λυκαβηττό, στην καρδιά της Αθήνας, με σούπερ μάρκετ στα 200 μ..

29973286,765286032,2021-06-01,51931114,Elena,"The apartment is clean and very comfortable, for a couple is perfect. The kitchen is fully equipped and one can cook if necessary. The bed is very good, mattress is soft, bed linen and towels are fresh and clean. There is a small balcony with a partial view of Acropolis, but opposite of the building is a primary school and a basketball playground, so during the day it's a bit noisy, but if you're not bothered about it then it'd be ok. There are few supermarkets in the vicinity with a good choice of food. Metro stations Neos Kosmos and Agios Ioannis are in 10 mins walk. To Acropolis 20 mins walk. The Host is very friendly and helpful and replies on messages immediately. We spent great time there and next time in Athens will stay there again. Thank you Homm! Recommend it!"

My room had two twin beds and a balcony with electric shutters.  Also a basin for washing smaller clothing loads.  The outlets were deeper than my power converter but the host had one extender for me that did the trick.  Overall a very nice value.  Might suggest finding space for a loveseat if possible.

Very quiet, well equipped, everything working. <br/>I really liked that there were laundry capsules (we were coming after a week of island hopping and had loads of laundry),  dishwasher powder, salt, pepper and sugar in the cupboards — in my experience I always have to buy it,  but had it waiting for me here  — very very helpful!<br/>Nikos is super helpful, responds within minutes!<br/><br/>Nice restaurants (I liked Michel 2-3 blocks away) and grocery stores within 5 minutes walk. <br/><br/>The beds are comfortable.

30000239,438131824976039954,2021-08-27,333069401,Mitchell,"Mixed feelings. The apartment itself is nice but there is bug bait everywhere and killed quite a few during our stay. We told the host who didn't address it. The apartment is nice but the bathrooms absolutely stink and we had to clean the drains daily otherwise the sewage smell would spread throughout the apartment. The host also didn't tell us they were jackhammering the floor of the unit directly underneath us which they knew about, I asked the workers and they notified all the owners in the building. The photos are accurate but the little things turned us off, and we won't be coming back. There is much better value in Kolonaki than this apartment, and the host was only nice while we stayed, and was kind of strange with the messages once we left."

From the moment you step out of the building, a nice short walk leads to the most hip places of Kolonaki area, for dining and  shopping. As I was visiting for a two day work seminar, was also happy to discover the apartment is completely isolated from noise and the internet reliable. What I mostly loved however is the feeling of brand new and spotless clean everything. <br/>The host was swift in her responses and discrete during my stay. Definitely recommended and thanks El for making my experience in Athens as nice. "

30000929,625389678,2020-05-20,330835752,Yanik,"Big, clean flat in good location. Easy Check in (self-checkin), secure spot for the car (locked parking place). However, no cutting knifes in the kitchen (bring your own!) and cockroaches in the building (general problem). <br/>Generally definitely worth the price and recommendable!"
30000929,666016664,2020-09-20,55419323,Frédérik,"Perfectly like the pictures and the announce. Very clean and the parking is super helpful in Athens. We were off to a bad start as we spent the night in another Airbnb in another neighborhood which was dangerous for the car and noisy. This one is perfectly located and the host was very responsive. I would recommand the restaurant Lostre Kouzina, 10’ from the apartment.<br/><br/>We would definitely come back !"

30002781,417426504,2019-02-27,44061089,Sophia,"The apartment is very bright and next to the metro station in a very quiet area. It is totally renovated with an amazing balcony and perfectly equipped. Also, the apartment has its own heating system which proved necessary as it was quite cold in Athens when we were there. Yorgos and Takis were very friendly and helpful with their tips about Athens.<br/><br/>Thank you for the hospitality!<br/>Sophia"
30002781,417697034,2019-02-28,99115309,Λουκας,"I stayed in the apartment  in the context of my stay in Athens for jobs.<br/><br/>Communication with Yorgos was very quick  and complete.<br/><br/>Takis who welcomed us was just perfect. <br/><br/>The apartment was great.<br/><br/>Parking free  in the street below the apartment, and metro station  is only 200 meters away.<br/><br/>I will come back  the summer when I come back to the beautiful Athens for holidays.   Thanks Yorgos."
30002781,423145948,2019-03-13,72510976,Vikki,This place is amazing and worth the price. It is a good price to begin with. It is so chic and in the heart of Athens. I would recommend everyone try to stay here. Yorgos is so friendly and nice. He also has a guide for all the places to visit.

30002781,434688826,2019-04-08,89117689,Isabelle,"A great find. Very well equipped in all aspects - kitchen, bathroom and bedrooms were all clean and tidy, with more than enough amenities. <br/>Very good location, with many shops, restaurants and bakeries etc close by. Metro station within 2 minutes walking distance. <br/>Takis was a very helpful host, with excellent communication from start to finish, with quick and detailed replies on any queries. <br/>Balcony and rooftop provided a nice place to eat and relax in the evenings and mornings, with little traffic or street noise in the area. <br/>Overall, a very enjoyable stay, I would definitely return :)"
30002781,438605692,2019-04-17,5187689,Mercedes,"Yorgos was incredibly accommodating for our stay - we arrived via ferry past the check in time, so he organized a transfer service to pick us up from the port and support us with getting into the apartment. The place has a beautiful balcony with amazing light and was very clean. All in all, it was a great stay for a couple nights in Athens!"
30002781,456281633,2019-05-21,21813308,Dania,"Our stay was incredible thanks to the fantastic apartment! The host was very welcoming and nice and gave us tips on where to go.

30002781,473655370,2019-06-22,54888213,Lydia,Simply amazing!  Yorgas was a very helpful host!  He set up transportation from the airport and to the Port of Rafina for a very reasonable rate and communicated with us almost immediately when we had questions. He even went out of his way to buy a clothes steamer for us to use. We also had an option to buy but we decided it was a little too large for our travels.  The apartment was spotless and the AC worked perfectly.  He also left us bread and butter for the morning as well as filtered coffee and espresso. We will be returning again to stay with Yorgas!<br/><br/>Travel tip: Uber will work in Athens and 9 times out of 10 it was insanely cheaper than getting a taxi on the street.
30002781,476453817,2019-06-26,18416495,Claudine,Our trip to the sunny rooftop apartment was made great by our helpful and welcoming host. The apartment was modern and clean. Also very close to the metro and in a less busy neighbourhood. Our host’s gave us local tips and each visit to these businesses were great. If there had not been a noisy construction job in the unit next to us our stay would have been just right. We know that this was beyond our host’s control. We would stay here again the next time visiting Athens
30002781,477867468,2019-06-29,58345136,Caitlin,"Thank you Yorgos and Takis for a wonderful stay in Athens! A great place to relax after exploring in the hot, June heat and a central location. Check in and out was very easy and seamless! Thank you again!"

Not only did they make sure we had a comfortable stay, they helped us organise transportation and made us feel genuinely looked after. The location is great, very central, vibrant area and very close to the metro making it very easy to get around. I can’t recommend the hosts and the apartment enough."

From the host greeting in person and being patient upon arriving much later than was said, to the bread and jam in the fridge, to the lovely large balcony with a view of the city!! Modern and beautifully decorated. A 2 minute walk to the metro and supermarket around the block. Can’t praise this flat enough - will definitely stay next time around."

30002781,529834422,2019-09-15,40850461,Nicola,"Wir mussten kurzfristig eine Unterkunft in Athen finden, weil unsere Fähre nicht gefahren ist. Das war sofort möglich und wir konnten eine Stunde später einchecken. Die Wohnung ist geräumig, modern und durchdacht eingerichtet, von der Ausstattung her definitiv auch für einen längeren Aufenthalt gut (Spül-/Waschmaschine, gute Küche). Alles funktioniert einwandfrei, ob Klimaanlage oder Abdunkelung der Zimmer. So professionell wie die Wohnung war auch die Kommunikation. Die Lage des Apartments ist okay, direkt an der Metro und in einem Wohnviertel. Highlight ist die schöne und große Terrasse!"

30002781,547498378,2019-10-15,11767327,Natasha,This place was great! The beds were extremely comfortable and the spaces are welcoming and livable. The balcony is even more incredible than the pictures show. The hosts had great communication and accommodated all of my requests.

La literie est impeccable. La terrasse permet de profiter de la fraîcheur du soir avec une vue sur le mont Lycabette. Bref, on se sent bien chez Yorgos."
30002781,560952598,2019-11-08,9066445,Clare,The stay here was super easy and the flat itself is gorgeous  - i loved the 'secret lighting' and sitting on the balcony in the shad of the mid day sun with some tea and a good book was ideal for a rest. i really appreciated the very clear instructions on how to get to the flat from the airport where the welcome and handover were equally stress-less. Yorgos and his team were all really helpful and friendly. I would gladly stay at this place again when i next find myself in Athens.

30002781,665251527,2020-09-18,4455190,Jordan & Rob,"We really enjoyed our stay, the facilities at the apartment are excellent and the rooms are spacious. The balcony is the best feature, it gets the sun all-day making it perfect for a morning breakfast and relaxing in the late-afternoon as the sun sets (with a bottle of wine!).<br/><br/>The apartment is slightly outside of the main city centre. However there is a metro station close by and because it’s located outside of the ‘tourist’ zone the supermarkets are well-priced.<br/><br/>If we return to Athens we wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again."

Personally, it was my first time in Greece, and spending a few nights there in Athens really capped off our vacation nicely. <br/><br/>We have friends who are locals and they told us that the area is a bit sketchy but we didn't feel any of it. The apartment, building, and area felt very secure. <br/><br/>We stayed there during the last week of July and according to the news and weather forecast, it was the hottest week in Greece ever, which didn't stop me from napping and tanning on the terrace.<br/><br/>Overall it was a pleasant stay, and I would love to come back to Greece and book this apartment again!"

The nearby metro can also be used for quickly getting in and out of the centre but it is also just a short walk to everything you will need.<br/><br/>The place itself is just as described. It is modern and clean and the neighbourhood is quiet. It has two double bedrooms and plenty of space for 2-4 people. The apartment has a large balcony which we enjoyed in the evenings.<br/><br/>Yorgos is a very responsive and helpful host who was always there to answer any questions or help us with anything! He even help us to arrange a taxi to go back to the airport at midnight, highly appreciated.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this place for people staying in Athens."

Το μοναδικό μείον που μπορώ να βρω είναι ότι η πολυκατοικία δεν διαθέτει ασανσέρ κατά τα αλλά τέλειο."
30006602,415698728,2019-02-23,78908436,Priscilla,This place was great and honestly Thomas was very considerate. We loved the place very clean and cozy and the place itself was amazing!

30006602,453250083,2019-05-15,139929999,Michael,The apartment was close to many attractions and plenty of food nearby. Communicating with the hosts was quick and easy. The bed in the apartment was very comfortable and I was able to sleep almost like I was home.
30006602,454437771,2019-05-18,50686134,Chelsea,"This was the most wonderful Airbnb! Do not hesitate to book the spot, very close to transit and within walking distance to the square and tons of restaurants. We loved that we were near everything but it was quiet at night and the bed was so comfortable. It was self check in and Thomas gave detailed instructions making it very easy. He also gave us tons of recommendations for the local spots to eat and drink and we truly appreciated that. If we are ever back in Athens we will definitely be staying here again!"
30006602,455852700,2019-05-20,3918709,Madisyn,"We really enjoyed our stay at Thomas's place. It was very clean, modern and easy enough to get to all of the sights we were trying to stay during our 48 hours in Athens. The one thing I would mention is that there is a club nearby and they played music until 3 am really loudly on the Saturday night we were there. Sunday night was okay and quiet so I would just keep that in mind if you're staying at the place during the weekend and go to bed a little earlier. Otherwise absolutely no complaints about the apartment it was perfect!"
30006602,456702432,2019-05-22,105272456,Jacob,This was exactly what we wanted. It's in an excellent location with the Acropolis and lively neighborhoods a short distance away. Everything was as advertised and Thomas gives excellent restaurant recommendations to someone unfamiliar with the area.
30006602,460363385,2019-05-29,219285067,Xinxin,The house is super close to Acropolis. And the room is clean and comfortable. The landlord helped us with airport pick-up service at 1:30am and provided us with a portable wifi when the original one not working well. Everything is warm.
30006602,463399717,2019-06-03,248822451,Rishabh,"The room is neat, clean and all amenities required for a comfortable stay have been provided by the host. The only thing missing was the personal touch. During our entire stay of 3 days, not once did the host or co-host bother to check if we had arrived at the property, if were comfortable during our stay, if all amenities worked just fine, if we needed anything. Despite multiple attempts the wifi failed to connect, but we dint bother contacting the host or the co-host to resolve this issue. The reason for that was we literally felt so uninvited. The only time someone bothered to communicate with us was through Airbnb mail service when we just landed in our home country. The surprising thing was, the mail din't ask us about our stay and comfort but instead asked us ""Hi, we cant seem to find one electronic gadget at our property, have you taken it with you by mistake. I mean this was so disgraceful. I was appalled. I wouldn't have bothered to write a harsh review because firstly I am not a hater. We are all humans and at some level we all make  errors and learn from them. I write it because of how disgracefully we were treated and for the sake of future guest who would be visiting this property. I once again vouch for the value for money, cleanliness, amenities etc. Don't Expect - A welcome or courtesy <br/>Do Expect - To be treated like a refugee been provided a shelter in an asylum."
30006602,464703360,2019-06-06,143975659,Cira L,Great location and great hosts! Communication was excellent.

30006602,471745374,2019-06-18,73773099,Jovana,My husband and I stayed here for one of our many places we stayed for our Honeymoon. The location of the apartment was in the central of Athens so that was a major plus. The apartment was super clean and modern. My only complaint was that the AC didn’t cool very much for the 2 nights we stayed but it wasn’t unbearable. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone. <br/>Oh and by the way if your from the states. The first floor is considered the 2nd floor. They will tell you apartment is on 3rd floor but in my mind it’s on the 4th floor hahaha just a little confusion we had when we first arrived but other then that all was well ❤️ oh and forgot to mention they do they help with transportation from/to the airport or ports which was a major plus!
30006602,472697607,2019-06-20,247314579,Brandon,This was a real cute spot. My wife loved the décor and the cleanliness. Communication with the Thomas was fantastic.
30006602,476866929,2019-06-27,190252243,Jessica,"Loved my stay at this home and would definitely stay here again if ever coming back to Athens! The space was gorgeous, well decorated, updated, and comfortable. It felt very much like a home, and was very clean. The kitchen was bigger than expected, and had plenty of amenities. The bed was comfortable and the linens were high quality, made it hard to want to get out of bed in the morning to explore the city. The house was elegant and simple, but lacked nothing. Very beautiful, very inviting, plenty of space. No complaints! Location was great as well, just a few minutes walk from a metro station, a grocery store, and restaurants. Wish I had stayed here longer than a couple of days!"
30006602,477870290,2019-06-29,49014244,Michelle,location is perfect! host is friendly and helpful! the place is clean and beautiful and with smart tv(bit self motives ha)
30006602,481058571,2019-07-04,118899596,Shalonda,"Great location, great host and a great place. Within walking distance from all major sites, lots of restaurants nearby and in a safe neighborhood. I was a solo female traveler and felt very comfortable staying here and walkingalone at night. I dealt with Homer who always had quick responses to my questions andconcerns and because of his attentiveness andexperience it made my checkin and check out seamless andeasy. I also took advantage of the airport transfer which was a huge lifesaver for a female solo traveler. I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again."
30006602,489114480,2019-07-16,43719270,Thomas,"Good location, great communication, excellent for our short stay in Athens."
30006602,491373572,2019-07-20,39465827,Vasco,"The apartment is delightful as is the neighbourhood. Quiet, beautiful and in walking distance to everywhere. Athens is a great city to walk and it was a pleasure to stay here and be able to explore knowing that you can return to such a nice space. I strongly recommend it."
30006602,495023317,2019-07-25,185330829,Aneta,"This apartment has an amazing location! It’s very close to Acropolis, Ancient agora of Athens as well as other sightseeing places in the old city, Plaka and Syntagma square. Many great restaurants, cafes and bars are within walking distance, too. The apartment itself is nice and cozy, suitable for one or two guests, and equipped with everything you need. All in all, I would say that this apartment is a very good value for money and I definitely recommend it."
30006602,501777372,2019-08-04,102234108,Mike,I really enjoyed my stay at this place! Convenient to all the sites and shopping. The neighborhood was also safe. The check in/out process was seamless- no issues at all.
30006602,505244521,2019-08-09,203075201,Alex,"A nice, clean, basic place to stay for a few nights. It was great to have a full kitchen and a washer available. Good size bathroom. Check in and check out was easy. The air conditioning however was very weak even on the coolest setting which made sleeping at night uncomfortable. We stayed during a hot August so perhaps this air bnb would be better during cooler months."
30006602,507136611,2019-08-11,32147684,Peter,"This place was excellent and id recommend to anyone visiting Athens. V near to the acropolis and a stone's throw from lots of restaurants + cafes, yet still quiet"
30006602,510381055,2019-08-16,22290548,Margherita,"The apartment looks exactly like the pictures, it is small but very clean and stylish. The position is perfect! Near Acropolis, Plaka and metro, but in a quiet neighborhood! The communication was easy and the responses were quick! I surely recommend this apartment!"
30006602,514338537,2019-08-21,25222604,Gaëtan,"Charming studio flat ideally located in Tisseou, close to vibrant Psirri & Monastiraki areas! Perfect to get a hence of local Athenian nightlife, also at the doorstep of archiological sites & historical monuments! The Homis were super responsive and gave us precious addresses & tips that really made our stay in Athens! I would certainly recommend :)<br/>Epharisto!"
30006602,521560387,2019-09-01,14083160,Joseph,"The apartment was great for our weekend in Athens. It is walking distance to the Acropolis and is in an amazing area. Homer was a great help, sending us a list of places to go to and setting up transportation for us. We will definitely be looking to stay here on next trip to Athens!"
30006602,523246725,2019-09-03,31624362,Kristina,"Communication was fantastic, arranged pickup/drop offs was super helpful being a solo traveler. Bed and location are awesome! One thing to be aware of- AC doesn’t quite cool down enough, so might be uncomfortable if you like to sleep with low temps."
30006602,524030631,2019-09-05,24635044,Elisabeth,We enjoyed our stay at this beautiful appartement. We had everything we needed and the location was perfect. The communication was great and they send us a lot of recommandations of restaurants et nice place to go. Thanks again!

30006602,527185503,2019-09-10,39973566,Andrea,"The place is exactly as in the pictures. Beautiful decorations, very clean and comfortable.<br/>The apartment is in a great location too, within easy walking distance to everything. Keep in mind you will have to climb 4 flights of stairs to get into the apartment, as the building has no elevators. I did not mind the stairs, as this is very common in Europe. <br/>We had their driver pick us up from the airport and drop us off at Piraeus port for a fee (similar to what a taxi would charge). This made our planning much easier and comfortable as we were travelling at very early hours & in the middle of the night (2 am when arrived and 6 am when we left). They also provided a list of suggestions on local food which was great. Very responsive host. Would definitely recommend."
30006602,531276068,2019-09-17,41266825,Santiago,Ubicación perfecta para visitar Atenas. Fuera del ajetreo y cerca de todo.
30006602,532176543,2019-09-19,45102125,Robyn,"A great location which was much quieter than the surrounding areas. A lovely park, some great restaurants, and a fantastic walk up to the Acropolis area. It was also a short walk to a busy bar/restaurant area and very accessible metro access in Thisso. The apartment itself as very clean and easy to access. The hosts are also very responsive! I would recommend this place to a tone staying in Athens!"
30006602,537709778,2019-09-29,25667642,Amanda,"This stay is very close to all main attractions. It was easy for us to walk everywhere. The check in and check out process was easy as very clear directions are given. The hosts communicate so well before, during and after the stay. They are so, so sweet. They constantly checked in on us to make sure we were enjoying our stay. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Homer, Isabella and Thomas!"
30006602,539785202,2019-10-02,113440711,Zinnia,"great space, about 8 minute walk from the metro station, 15 min walk to the main square, only 15 mins to the acropolis, five minute walk from restaurants, at first though the location wasn't too great but after exploring the next day realized it was in a good location, not too far from everything, somewhat in the middle , 40 minutes from the Athens airport, technically on the 4th floor, great stay!"

30006602,609052388,2020-02-22,17727,Rebecca,"This was my favorite place that I stayed in Athens.  Quiet building, just a stone's throw away from the pedestrian part of Thissio with many cafes, sidewalk peddlers, and a general positive bustle.  Sits at the foot of the Acropolis.  Also a short walk from Planka and the major tourist attractions.  And a beautiful and cozy place with an incredibly comfortable bed."

30006602,667691897,2020-09-25,27434383,Hannah,"This apartment was in a perfect location for us, a British couple wanting to walk to the major sights of Athens. We had no need for public transport and had a great view of the Acropolis every time we left or returned to the apartment. The local bars and restaurants were great too, it took only 2 or 3 minutes to reach breakfast every day or to walk home from evening cocktails with a view of the Parthenon. There is a bakery and pharmacy right across the street, both of which we found useful. We chose to take the hosts up on their offer of a driver from the airport which took any anxiety away both arriving and departing. The apartment itself was lovely and we were pleased to find that we had absolutely everything we needed - washing machine, drying racks, towels, shampoo, hairdryer, oven, microwave, kettle, cooking utensils, ice box... etc. Using the TV was easy and we had a couple of chilled evenings on the sofa watching Netflix. One thing to be aware of is that there is no elevator in the building and the apartment is on the 3rd floor - but the lovely balcony makes it worthwhile!"

I suggested to share the costs of the night as neither Homer nor we could habe changed the strike!

30006602,735078411,2021-02-28,342879053,Aris,Place is great for the price. The location is killer if you want to explore the center on foot. Personally I felt that the house rules and fees that they included were patronizing  and made me feel unwelcome. The place needs a couple of repairs but nothing serious. Overall I enjoyed my stay and may return in the future.
30006602,745244492,2021-04-04,342879053,Aris,"The place felt like home and we’ve stayed there before. This time around we asked to reschedule our stay because we had to deal with a personal problem. They didn’t try to accommodate us in any way and outright declined our request. We would stay there again were it not for the automatic replies, the spammy messages and lack of hospitality."

Or ce n'ai pas possible je lui est même dis où exactement elle était!<br/>Les échanges pour la récupérer on duré plusieurs jours, ( je suis restée encore 5 jours) mais je n'ai jamais récupéré ma casquette, pour moi c'est du vol!!!<br/><br/>J'y tenait énormément. <br/>Faite attention à ne rien oublier."

Il y a aussi des petits restaurants cachés, glaciers ainsi qu'une boulangerie en face de l'appartement qui propose un large choix de pâtisseries très bonnes et les vendeuses y sont très gentilles.<br/>Concernant les hôtes, nous les avons trouvé très gentils, serviables et toujours à l'écoute. Par-exemple, nous n'avions plus de sacs poubelles et leur en ont informé, le lendemain ils étaient venus nous en fournir devant la porte de l'appartement. Ils nous ont même proposé de bénéficier du service de leur chauffeur pour un transfert vers l'aéroport.<br/>Je recommande à 100% ce logement, c'est juste ce qu'il vous faut si vous êtes de passage ou pour 5j à Athènes.<br/><br/>Je leur remercie encore pour leur hospitalité et leur réponse rapide aux messages."

It is located in the city center, all attractions are within walking distance - we visited all of Athens without using public transport! <br/>The flat is modern and nicely decorated. Everything is perfectly clean and tidy. The apartment is provided with fresh towels, shampoo, soap, hair dryer, TV, fridge and basic things to prepare meals. <br/>Constantinos turned out to be an extremely helpful smiling man, he answered all questions very quickly.<br/>The only downside may be the district where the apartment is located - we did not feel safe returning to the apartment in the evenings. However, the district seems calm during the day.<br/>Although the apartment is located on the seventh floor, the street sounds are very loud. Light sleepers may need earplugs (Constantinos has taken care of such). There must also be a music club near the apartment, because on Saturday we heard loud music all night long."

Amenities were all great and Stella was extremely responsive and accommodating. <br/>The house is great.

Big common area and 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.

The house is clean and big, and indeed has a view of the Acropolis ! If you have a good camera, the terrace is a fine place to have your postcard type picture of the monument. The neighborhood is also very nice with plenty of restaurants, shops and facilities. I would certainly come back to Stella's place in my next Athens' visit."

30012109,425454473,2019-03-18,99548374,Eric,"There are not enough wonderful things I can say about Stella and her apartment.  First off, Stella is an incredible host.  From the minute we booked, she was extremely attentive, providing responses within minutes of when I would message her.  It is obvious how much care and attention she takes in hosting.  <br/><br/>Before heading to Athens, she sent me a message with a ton of different restaurant recommendations and other tips that were very helpful since we never been to Athens.  She arranged a taxi from the airport for us and we had a great driver (Michael) who gave us lots of great advice.  He was super friendly and welcoming.  Stella also arranged that he had the key when picking us up at the airport, making the check-in process effortless.  Michael provided incredible service, taking our bags as soon as we arrived at the airport and helping us all the way into the elevator.<br/><br/>When we arrived at the AirBnB, we were welcomed with Ouzo and a Greek snack.  Her apartment is beautiful and has an incredible, large balcony that overlooks the Acropolis.  We couldn't have been more pleased with the apartment and the view.  And every time we had a question, she provided a response within minutes.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a great apartment and host, look no further than Stella and her apartment.  We will be back to Athens in the future, and we only hope that Stella's place is available for our next trip.<br/><br/>Thank you, Stella, for making our first trip to Greece an unforgettable one!<br/><br/>Eric"

The Acropolis and many other main attractions are no more than a leisurely 10min walk away and there are loads and loads of adorable little shops and restaurants at your doorstep. <br/><br/>The area is super safe and super friendly, only a 5min walk from Syntagma Square which has a metro straight to/from the airport. <br/><br/>The place itself was sparkling clean and spacious. An amazing balcony we thoroughly enjoyed with a view of the Acropolis! So magical! <br/><br/>Stella was super easy to communicate with, either over (Hidden by Airbnb) or via DM. She left some homemade ouzo for us to try as well as yummy Easter bread which was the sweetest touch! She provided lots of helpful local tips and was accommodating with checking out a bit later. I'm so happy I got to meet her face to face, she is just as lovely in person."
30012109,452471276,2019-05-13,5636463,Jean Claude,"Nous reviendrons surement chez Stella. <br/>Son accueil témoigne d'une attention toute particulière à ses hôtes.<br/>L'appartement est excellemment bien placé, il est propre, lumineux et très confortable.<br/>La terrasse permet de passer des moments très chaleureux avec une superbe vue sur l'Acropole. A deux pas de la Plaka, il est totalement au calme et permet des aller venus pour ceux qui se fatigue comme moi. Tout est facile et on peut ressortir le soir à loisirs.<br/>En quelques mots c'est une excellente adresse sur Athènes et nous y reviendrons surement s'il reste de la disponibilité ce qui risque de ne pas être évident au vu de la qualité de cet appartement et de ses propriétaires."

The location was ideal- easy access to the metro and a pretty quick walk to Plaka, the Acropolis and Monastiraki. It was well furnished with plenty of toiletries. We didn't actually cook in the kitchen but it looked pretty well stocked. The check in and out process was super easy and we enjoyed our stay!"

There is a large balcony with a great view of the Acropolis, and the apt is within walking distance of many restaurants and coffee shops. It was so spacious and stylish that we decided to enjoy some wine in the apartment before heading out for the evening. There was even a small bottle of ouzo for us to sample! Would definitely return in the future."

The terrace is fantastic for sitting out on, with good views of the Acropolis. We slept in the back bedroom, which was nice and quiet. I imagine the front bedroom would be a bit nosier, which is to be expected given the central location, but we slept really well here. The lift is a welcome addition to get up and down to the apartment after a long day of sightseeing! <br/><br/>Definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a great location, with a great host and some lovely outside space to enjoy a glass of wine!"

It came exactly as described, with some extra very nice touches by the hosts including some home made ouzo and a retsina toast for our arrival!  Stella and Niko were easily reachable and checked in but were not intrusive.  I felt very secure that if anything happened I could reach them easily.  <br/><br/>The apartment was bright and modern with comfortable beds, linens and towels.

And the balcony with the view of the Acropolis was just stunning. That's were everyone gathered to relax and enjoy each other's company. It could not have been a better location. It is in Plaka, a short walk to Acropolis and close to Syntagma. Stella and Nikos were the best hosts. They helped make arrangements for a driver to pick us up at the airport and we did the  same to catch a ferry from piraeus. Very convinient and highly recommended for a stress free visit.

Paddling pool on terrace a thoughtful addition. Flat is up five flights of stairs (there is a lift which is quite small). Good air con (needed in summer). Very helpful hosts - quick to communicate and lots of helpful local tips. Not an enormous flat but we stayed there five adults and two children and it was a perfect base to explore the city. Some midges come out on terrace at night wear cream and use burners to deter them. Have fun.

30012109,530646845,2019-09-16,50336494,Kathryn,"Incredible place to stay!! The location could not be better for exploring Athens - very walkable to historic sites, fun and safe neighborhood, delicious restaurants just blocks away. The photos of the balcony don’t fully capture how beautiful and peaceful it is out there. It is the perfect place for morning coffee or an evening glass of wine. The hosts were incredibly thoughtful, leaving toys for our child and helping arranging transportation to the airport. And they are very responsive - when a small issue came up with the apartment they responded immediately and stopped by to address it in just a few hours time. We would absolutely stay here again and will recommend to friends!"

Thank you again, Stella & Nikos, we will be back!"

La terraza es un lugar perfecto para desayunar o cenar, relax y vistas, la hemos disfrutado mucho. Aunque no les hemos conocido, Stella está muy atenta a todo, organizando la llegada, la salida, y contestando a todo lo que necesitemos al instante. La pega son los baños, que necesitan alguna mejora en cuanto a la presión, poder colgar la alcachofa bien en el baño gris, o que no se llene de agua el baño azul al ducharse. En cualquier caso, es una buena opción a ese precio y en esa ubicación"
30012109,539808292,2019-10-02,49595617,Courtney,Stella was very quick st responding and arranged transport to and from the hotel for us. The location was perfect and the place itself was lovely

Plaka is a safe area where this apartment is located and very easy access to so many cafes and restaurants and shopping.  Simple grocery store is also near the apartment.  Walking distance to Ermou and Nikis Streets for coffee, ice cream, bakery, restaurants and shopping.  Apartment has a decent size elevator to go up to the apartment floor.  Check in procedure is very clear and simple to follow.  Stella often responses to my questions so quickly to ensure guest concerns will be addressed.  The kitchen tools and utensils are plentiful and complete if one wants to cook simple breakfast/meals or heat up food or boil water, etc."

El check in es muy cómodo y en la casa hay de todo. Es cierto que fuimos en enero y la calefacción central no estaba encendida pero nos pudimos apañar con el aire aunque no caldea de la misma forma. Recomiendo la casa a todo el mundo.

The apartment has all the essentials, though it would be pretty tight if you had six people filling the three bedrooms. It's close to main square and a great base to explore central Athens on foot. You will have to walk a bit to get to the nicest part of Plaka."
30012109,611452033,2020-02-27,36981711,Nicole,"Wir waren wirklich sehr begeistert von der Unterkunft! Die Unterkunft ist sehr zentral und so konnten wir so gut wie alles zu Fuß erreichen. Wir haben uns sehr wohl und sicher gefühlt. <br/>Die Wohnung befindet sich in einer Nebenstraße und so war es nachts auch nicht laut und man konnte gut schlafen. <br/>Das absolute Highlight der Wohnung ist die wunderschöne Terrasse mit dem Ausblick auf die Acropolis. Da das Wetter im Februar sehr gut war, konnten wir so wunderbar in den Tag starten mit einem Frühstück auf der großen Terrasse. <br/><br/>Die Unterkunft war groß und somit für Gruppen geeignet. Es war sehr sauber und schön eingerichtet. Zur Begrüßung haben wir von der Gastgeberin einen hausgemachten Ouzo bekommen (Danke nochmal dafür :) )!  Die Küche war gut ausgestattet. <br/><br/>Die Gastgeberin war immer erreichbar und wirklich sehr nett! Bei Fragen hat sie innerhalb kurzer Zeit geantwortet! <br/><br/>Wir können diese Unterkunft zu 100% empfehlen und würden auch jeden Fall wiederkommen!  Danke für alles Stella! :)"

The sunset and Acropolis at night were beautiful, so relaxing. <br/><br/>Highly recommend<br/><br/>Stella gave tips for local places and was super attentive and answered questions timely. Fixed the shower head swiftly. Spacious place. Beds were not too hard. Not too soft."
30012109,617184505,2020-03-12,72602793,Joshua,"I would not hesitate to stay here again; Stella and Nikos went above and beyond to answer my questions, arrange transportation from the airport, provide local recommendations...I could rant and rave for hours about how incredible they were. The place itself is fantastic, close to Syntagma Square and the metro, and their view of the Acropolis gave me goosebumps every time I looked at it. There were only two of us on this trip, but the place is spacious and had room for plenty guests. If you are considering this place, you probably won’t do any better!"
30012109,619028642,2020-03-16,208457763,András,Stella and Nikos are fantastic hotsts. The flat is wonderfully spacious and the balcony is a huge extra! It overlooks the Acropolis and has more than enough space for seven or eight guests even. Would definitely book again! Thanks again.
30012109,628851601,2020-06-11,70631661,Dimitrios,A nice stay at a premium location with professional hosts.
30012109,629871182,2020-06-15,139823007,Λυδια,Υπέροχοι και εξυπηρετικοί οικοδεσπότες!<br/>Η τοποθεσια του σπιτιού είναι ιδανική και η θέα της Ακρόπολης η καλύτερη ανταμοιβή για εμάς στο τέλος της ημέρας καθώς βρισκόμασταν στην Αθήνα για επαγγελματικούς λόγους κ δεν μπορούσαμε να δούμε τις ομορφιές της Πλάκας. Το διαμέρισμα ήταν πολυ άνετο και λειτουργικό .
30012109,630732346,2020-06-20,14528952,Allan,Five star experience!
30012109,634164245,2020-07-03,31905321,Alexandra,"The apartment is located right in the center of Athens where you have everything at your doorstep! I am an Athenian living abroad and I was able to finish all my tasks in 2-3 afternoons due to this great location. If you are a tourist, the historic center is less than a 5 min walk. The check-in was very stress-free and communication with the host very quick. The balcony and the view of Acropolis and Erechtheion are the best part of the apartment. The kitchen is a bit small with not a lot of room to prepare/cook things but who needs it when you have so many choices the moment you exit the building (from a vegan restaurant to all types of cuisines).  There was a welcome treat in the apartment (homemade ouzo, did not try, as I am not fond of ouzo, but appreciated) and a kids' small swimming pool was ready to use outside the balcony (we don't have a small kid but it was very thoughtful).  I am very sensitive to noise and the apartment was quiet during the night. The reason I did not give an excellent review is that the apartment is not renovated and for a longer stay as ours (10 days) with no touristic purpose, we needed a different set up in terms of space. Final tip: If you rent a car, make sure you park only where it is allowed (not a lot of choices and difficult to find parking) as you WILL get a ticket. Or use the nearby private parking places. Would I stay again? Yes I would."
30012109,635871320,2020-07-08,34003899,Tine,"The place is super central, tidy and clean! Our highlight was the Terrace with a view on the Akropolis. The communication with Stella and Nikos was very friendly and they had many helpful tips to experience Athens :) we recommend staying here !"

We booked really late (9.00 AM for the same day), but Stella was very responsive and super flexible about leaving our luggage in the apartment until the cleaners were ready. We asked for some local lunch/brunch/dinner and drinks tips, and literally every single one that Stella recommended turned out to be amazing! The flat itself was lovely, lots of space and a nice balcony with a very comfy swing chair. We are already looking forward to staying here another time! Thanks so much Stella!"

30012109,671470213,2020-10-05,76988583,Sophie,"L’appartement est à distance de marche de presque tous les sites historiques d’Athènes. Il est très bien éclairé et spacieux. La vue de l’Acropole à partir du balcon est un énorme plus. Le plus important, à mon avis, est que Stella est une hôtesse formidable. Nous avons eu avec elle une excellente expérience avant et pendant notre séjour. Elle a organisé le transport en provenance et en direction de l’aéroport, elle nous a donné les adresses de bons petits restos et de supermarchés des environs. Une perle! Elle met la barre haute pour le reste des hôtes d’AirBnB. Le jour où je reviendrai à Athènes, c’est encore chez elle que je logerai. Je lui donne 10 étoiles +++!!!!"

We walked everywhere!!! 5 mins from Syntagma, 5 mins from the national gardens, 5 mins from the acropolis, and 5 mins from monastiraki! I honestly cannot emphasize how great the location is! Stella was fantastic throughout, keeping in contact with us at all times and offering us advice and tips. Stella is full of energy, kind and extremely helpful. The apartment was just as described, spotlessly clean and full of amenities. I would highly recommend Stella's apartment and will be staying there again."

Amazing location, heart of the city. The self check in directions were super accurate and helpful and despite being a last minute reservation and not an easy at all...

The flat is located in 5 min walk to very good restaurants and main transport nodes. From the metro staition nearby is a direct line to the airport and to the sea port.<br/>The apartment was very clean and it had everything you need for comfort stay: hot water,  enough towels, dishes in the kitchen and so on. It was great in the evening to relax in the hot tub on the balcony with an outstanding view on the Athens Acropolis! Stella arranged very comfortable airport transfer, easy key pick up on the place and very kind welcome drink :) <br/>Totally best place for staying in Athens!"

The three bedrooms are spacious.  The two bathrooms in such a small space are a nice feature.  Additional pluses include the washing machine, large flat screen TV, zippy WiFi and elevator to the 5th floor.  In spite of the urban location, the nights were pretty quiet.<br/><br/>Stella and Nikos were great hosts.  When I return to Athens, their apartment will be my first choice."

30012109,389610471185265161,2021-06-21,19666249,Beth,Great value for the price and location. We had a large group of six so a bit cramped but everyone had their own bed. Great view from the balcony especially after dark. Happy to return later this week!

30012109,405561441629298797,2021-07-13,40214691,Piper,"I really enjoyed my stay in Plaka! Stella & Nikos are the perfect hosts. Check in/out was seamless and they were available 24/7! The space was large enough for a family or girls trip. The BALCONY was EVERYTHING! Sitting in the jacuzzi at night with the view of the Acropolis lit up, was like a dream! And did I mention LOCATION! It was perfect. We were within walking distance of everything. We never had to take a cab other than round trip to the airport. Stella arranged pick up and drop off. She gave us great suggestions for places to eat, do & see. The property is older however. The elevator is tiny, so you may need a couple of trips if you have a lot of luggage. The unit could use some HGTV upgrades, but the space is very comfortable. Overall a great value for the price!"
30012109,409884525758000057,2021-07-19,6806334,Bella,"FABULOUS inside and out. Spacious apartment was above expectations — it’s huge — and the balcony was AMAZING, more than perfect for our family’s first visit to Athens. Stella made the check in/out processes so simple and communicated nearly immediately with my questions.  BEST LOCATION, too. Easy walking distance to a variety of delicious tavernas, cafes, and more. And steps from busy avenues making taxis easy. It was truly perfect!!"

30012109,421491739423398499,2021-08-04,335474948,Sakis,"Η διαμονή μας ήταν υπέροχη, μπαίνοντας στον χώρο διαπιστώνει κανείς ότι οι διαχειριστές έχουν βάλει μεράκι και φροντίδα. Γίνεται αμέσως ξεκάθαρο ότι υπάρχει μεγάλη εμπειρία στα ταξίδια γι'αυτό και έχουν φροντίσει το διαμέρισμα σαν να πρόκειται να μείνουν οι ίδιοι, μέχρι την τελευταία λεπτομέρεια, χωρίς εκπτώσεις και τσιγκουνιες. Εν μέσω όλων, μου έκαναν ιδιαίτερη εντύπωση τα θετικά μηνύματα που είναι διάσπαρτα στους τοίχους του σπιτιού. Ευχαριστούμε πολύ Στέλλα και Νίκο, θα ξαναέρθουμε"
30012109,422943271665501398,2021-08-06,405815974,Maria,I highly recommend staying at this beautiful apartment! The location is great and within walking distance to the Plaka and many amazing restaurants. Stella and Nikos were amazing hosts who were quick to reply and they even kept us updated on things that were happening in Athens. They gave us recommendations on where to eat breakfast and helped us find storage for our luggage since our flight had a late departure. Very clean apartment with a great balcony. I would 100% stay here again.

30012109,435199006228827780,2021-08-23,1944833,Melissa,"This was the cherry on top of our Greece adventures! Well worth the expense if you appreciate amazing views of acropolis from a jacuzzi in the centre of Athens. Stella was very easy to communicate with and ready to help at any moment, the apartment is huge and extremely clean, and the location is just a view minutes walk from anything that takes your fancy in this phenomenal city. Highly recommended!"
30012109,438827229042756331,2021-08-28,149390005,Ryan,Great place to stay!<br/><br/>My friends and I spent a night here before our flight out of Athens and we couldn’t have asked for more! <br/><br/>It very much suited us as there was 12 of us and would have been a nightmare trying to sort hotels/hostels for us all but this place sorted everyone out.<br/><br/>The hot tub is obviously a major plus and works perfectly.<br/><br/>The place was lovely and clean.<br/><br/>The biggest plus that I have to mention is how the hosts went above and beyond to make sure our stay was pleasant. They organised taxis for 12 of us from the port to the Airbnb and then again from the Airbnb to the airport the next day- even organising taxis at 10pm at night.<br/>They were also really helpful in helping retrieve my friends AirPods which had been left in the taxi!<br/><br/>I can’t recommend this place enough if you’re a big group or even a smaller one looking for a place to stay in a good location in Athens!
30012109,446781393973174124,2021-09-08,4521003,Bailey,From the very beginning Stella was quick to reply with any questions I had. She arranged our transportation from the airport to the apartment in a nice safe vehicle and the driver was very friendly as well. When we arrived the location can’t be beat! It is the perfect place for a small or large group traveling. The view from the balcony was spectacular and we spent a lot of our time enjoying it. The neighborhood has tons of delicious restaurants and the cutest little wine store all within a very quick walk. <br/>We needed covid tests to continue our travels and Stella was very informative of places available close by. We have already recommended this apartment to some of our other friends who will be traveling through in the next few weeks. We can not wait to stay here again with some family next summer.
30012109,447492107977906688,2021-09-09,27046315,Julia,Great apartment in a good position for the sights and restaurants in the Plaka area. Comfortable and clean. Home from home feel. Lovely.

30012109,466367279771172609,2021-10-05,15282322,Chelsea,"Lovely flat right in the heart of Athens, location-wise couldn’t ask for anything better. <br/><br/>We had some difficulties with the lift not working when we arrived to check in, and the stairs were pitch black so my mom actually fell down the steep steps and hurt herself pretty badly :( Also the hot tub was not preheated (you have to ask ahead of time which I did not realize), and the washing machine not being connected to an extension cord so we could not do laundry. <br/><br/>Unfortunately for us these issues were pretty detrimental at that point in our trip, but Stella responded promptly and was very eager to help with every single thing we had questions about.<br/><br/>It really was a wonderful flat right in the heart of the city with a beautiful view of the Acropolis. Tons of fantastic dining and nightlife right nearby, plus a short walk to the hop-on-hop-off bus as well as the metro station at Syntagma Square. I’d still recommend this booking despite the issues we had during our stay, it’s just unfortunate for us that some issues arose."
30012109,467897770469774824,2021-10-07,16553045,Renee,Great location / central to many attractions and restaurants! The walk around Plaka was very easy. There was plenty of room<br/>my group of 4. And the laundry option was timely at the end of our trip. Added bonus: the hot tub on the patio!
30012109,475806770404803691,2021-10-18,15958806,Javi,Nice apartment and helpful hosts (they allowed me to leave my luggage before the official check-in hour).<br/>When I left my luggage the cleaning lady was there and she was doing a good job cleaning the house (normally you don't have the opportunity to see these things).
30012109,480913924975286366,2021-10-25,421884520,Ellie,The host was so helpful with arranging transportation from the airport and luggage storage. With 9 people it can be difficult to sort out both of these! The host always responded quickly and assisted us in every aspect of our stay. So glad we decided to stay here! Not sure our trip would have been as enjoyable without the Stella and Nikos’ help!

The neighborhood was safe, with a lot of great cafes and places to eat in the nearby area.

Overall, the whole process was really organised, which helped a lot."

30027258,400191231,2019-01-11,112403939,Andra,Amazing host and place! The accuracy of the place was better than expected! Location was absolutely great! Could get to the city centre and main attractions in 15 minutes by foot. At check-in Toni’s friend welcomed us and quickly did some orientation on the map for us. There is a hill about 5 minutes from the house that we really enjoyed hiking and it leads to the city centre as well.

30027258,431944255,2019-04-02,131607460,Duncan,If I could give 6 stars I would. The apartment looks exactly like the photos and the bed was exceptionally comfortable especially after a long flight.  The place was spotless and shower good. Toni was great in communicating with us and arranged airport transfers both ways. He made the whole experience very pleasant for us and I have no hesitation in recommending both him and the apartment. <br/><br/>We only stayed one night as we had a transfer to Zakynthos but the area looked good.

Our bus from Delphi was late by over two hours and Toni and his friend Stathis were so accommodating waiting for us to finally arrive. Stathis also gave us very helpful tips regarding our extremely early departure for the ferry the next day and arranged a super convenient pick up service for us. We would whole heartedly recommend this super comfortable, chic, and relaxing spot to anyone!"

30027258,524484662,2019-09-06,133389450,Judy,I love the modernity of Toni’s place.  This place is highly recommended!!  There were 4 of us who travelled & Toni has an offer of a pick up ride from the airport for 4 people at 38 Euros.  I recommend that you take this ride if you’re 4-5 people.   It is already a very good deal rather than taking the metro which you will pay 10 Euros per person.  Toni’s place is about 15 mins walk from Acropolis which is really good for travelers who want to shed off some calories from the good food that Athenians offer.  The closest eating place is about a block or 2 away.

30032049,409621334,2019-02-08,95252885,Deya,A clean and modern apartment in a quiet neighbourhood of Athens. The building appears to be an old hotel where the rooms have been converted into apartments. The metro is a 10 minute walk and there is a small supermarket on the same road. Plenty of places  to eat within walking distance. The acropolis a 20min walk.

30032049,412683890,2019-02-16,127358626,Mirosław,"We're still really amazed by how comfy and nice Toni's apartment was. It was the best place rented by us via AirBnB for now. Apartment is really nice, it's elegant, comfortable, modern and sunny. <br/><br/>Bedroom has the nicest bed I saw during my tourist carrer. It was really difficult to get up and go do some sightseeing. We weren't getting up earlier than 10 a.m. because of that, so take it for consideration while choosing this place - it's so nice, that you won't want to go outside :). <br/><br/>In bedroom we found a nice big wardrobe with spare sheets and blankets in case of cold. They weren't need fortunately. There also was ironing board and dryer avalible, so if you want to dry your towels for example indoor, it's not a problem.<br/><br/>Main room with kitchen are also great. There is TV with a lot of greek channels (we found especially MAD TV entertaining, since there's a lot of greek music ;)), comfy sofa and coffe table. <br/><br/>In the kitchen you'll find Nespress coffe machine and kettle. Teas and coffe capsules are provided by Toni, so you can start your day with nice cup of hot beverage. :) There are plates, forks, spoons etc. - everything you'll need. Fridge, dishwasher etc. works perfectly, however considering that there's a lot of nice restaurants and bars in close neighborhood, we didn't use them very oftern :).<br/><br/>Bathroom is somewhat small, but for two persons it was big enough. Shower has good pressure and such thing you don't see very often in apartments here on AirBNB. Every other thing in bathroom was also ok, we don't have any bad memories regarding it. <br/><br/>Neighborhood is great - it's quiet, peacefull and you can sleep well :). There are few convenience stores in close proximity, where you can buy groceries and good greek chocolate (ION company, try it!). There are also two pedestrian streets with a lot of nice restaurants and bars. Metro is really close - about 7-10 minutes of slow walk. There are also some bus stops nearby, but we didn't use bus, only metro, so I don't have any opinion about them.<br/><br/>Toni as a host is great - every message on airbnb was replied quickly, Toni's friend who met us was also very friendly and helpful. <br/><br/>Summary - we're really, really satisfied with this apartment. It happened to be really above our expectation and I can't recommend it for everyone, who want to spend their time in Athens."

Internet was above average.  (200 Mbps) Easily stream videos.  I highly recommend staying at Toni's!"
30032049,457393782,2019-05-24,95986089,Leonard,"Tonis place was as described. The place was very clean, had all amenities, location was great. Also helped us organising transfer to and from the accommodation at a reasonable price. Toni had someone come to the house, check us in and gave us maps of Athens, huge help and great service. Would definately recommend."

30032049,461166631,2019-05-31,53714103,EspritsLove,"Insgesamt eine gute Wohnung, allerdings nicht halb so schick, wie es die Fotos hoffen lassen. Sehr heruntergekommener Stadtteil und dementsprechendes Mehrfamilienhaus; die Wohnung wirkt zwar renoviert und ordentlich eingerichtet, es ist aber dennoch nur ein guter Ort zum Übernachten, nicht zum komfortablen Aufenthalt. Die Lage ist zwar hinsichtlich der Verkehrsanbindung gut, da in unmittelbarer Nähe eine Bushaltestelle und in 5-10 Minuten eine Metrohaltestelle erreichbar ist. Da die gesamte Gegend aber sehr dreckig und laut war, haben wir uns nicht so richtig wohlgefühlt. Allerdings ist das wahrscheinlich in Athen grundsätzlich so... Toni war als Gastgeber immer gut zu erreichen, auch wenn wir ihn nicht persönlich kennengelernt haben; auch das Abholen und Hinbringen zum Flughafen für je 38 € für zwei Personen hat super geklappt. Komisch finde ich allerdings, dass ich nach dem Aufenthalt von Toni gebeten wurde, ihm eine 5-Sterne-Bewertung zu geben, weil ihm das ""sehr helfen"" würde. So sollte eine solche Bewertungsmöglichkeit ja eigentlich gerade nicht funktionieren..."
30032049,463422013,2019-06-03,83055129,Nurlan,"This is a great apartment, very modern, sparking clean and big enough for 2 or even 3 persons. Toni was quick to respond all along. We were greeted by Toni’s friend who gave us all necessary instructions; she also gave us useful local tips and information about local restaurants. Toni was able to secure a taxi to the airport at a very short notice. The apartment is close (within a walking distance) to Acropolis, Plaka and Monasteraki. This is a great value. I give my highest recommendation for this apartment."

It is about 10 mins to the nearest metro. The check in was smooth and the host gave us loads of really useful information on where to go and how to get around Athens. The apartment was clean and really well equipped. We had a lovely stay here.

Her English is very very good so there was no trouble with a language barrier. Check in was very easy, she met us at the door of the apartment building and met us again for checkout even though we left early in the morning to catch a flight. <br/><br/>The apartment itself is beautiful, the lounge has a spacious balcony and parquet floorboards. It’s small but laid out nicely so it feels larger than it is. To our surprise a cool breeze blew through the apartment all night and in general the airflow was very nice. There was also air conditioning and heating available in the lounge and bedroom which we didn’t need to use. <br/><br/>The location is great, a 15 minute walk from Excharchia and closer to a bunch of gyros places. It was a 10/10 experience for the price. We will be returning to this place. Thanks so much Ejvis!"

30038583,406335002,2019-01-29,147209642,Makenzie,"We loved this place! The use of space was so great, it gave you multiple rooms that flowed into each other. It felt like a unique space and we wish we could have stayed longer. It had much more outdoor area on the wraparound patio than we realized from the pictures  and had a very beautiful view, especially at night with the hill lit up. With the elevator going right up into the apartment it felt like living in a penthouse. The loft bed had a lot of headspace and area beside it to put things or sit, and it was much nicer than we expected. The bed was comfortable. We didnt use the bathtub or fireplace because we only stayed one night but we wish we had stayed at the start of our trip because it would have been lovely to make use of them (worth noting there is no shower though, only a bathtub with a hand wand). Good heating and strong wifi. We walked to Syntagma square in about 20 minutes at 3:30am and felt safe. There are also plenty of places to get food nearby and the metro station is about 12 minutes away. We would stay again if we came back to Athens."

They've changed the owner during this time, so the communication was pretty weird. <br/><br/>Good things : <br/>Apartment is very nice. Nice terrace. Nice windows. Nice view. <br/>Super nice hood <br/><br/>Things to improve : <br/>it’s not super convenient for long stay (I was there for 8 nights) <br/>It's an ""Air"" appart : empty flat. There is pretty much nothing. <br/>In the kitchen : one old pan, on giant saucepan, salad bowl, knifes, forks, spoons, glasses, cups and that’s it. No dishtowels. <br/>In the bedroom : one mattress on a pallet (confortable tho), night tables are almost collapsing . Nothing to put your clothes. No extra blanket, no extra pillow. <br/>In the living room : one little old sofa and one TV <br/><br/>there is no pressure in the shower .  <br/>I was not able to open the stairs entrance.  Maybe it's me, but I was unable to turn the key. <br/><br/>When the it's raining too hard . there are leaks in the apartment. I sent pics to the (old) owner, but no answer. <br/><br/>They have work to do, but the place is very cool. <br/>The new owner told me they will take care of everything."

30038583,512132332,2019-08-18,26748184,Danny,Somewhat difficult checkin process as there’s a locked entrance and an old elevator. Would have been quite difficult if we didn’t have cell reception. Decent location that is still walkable to hot spots and place was nice and unique. Good value and pretty good communication
30038583,516406541,2019-08-24,16168905,Sylvain,"Beautiful and confortable small loft on the last floor with a nice terrace and hence a nice view. Located in a nice area behind the university with lots of bookshops, places to get out and greens on terraces around. Strongly recommended."
30038583,518116062,2019-08-26,19508695,Frederic,"The flat is nice and located quite close from the interesting areas of Athenes. The lift ends up directly in the flat which is surprising but great. A bit hot inside the flat during the summer days, the AC in the kitchen do not work very well, hopefully the one in the room works perfectly. I recommend this flat."
30038583,520278282,2019-08-30,17856021,Alexander,"This flat is amazing! Perfect and interesting neighborhood. Dimitri is a very good communicator, and the check in with his mom was very smoothly. We highly recommend this gem, we'd love to come back."

30038583,561880173,2019-11-10,119995688,Marie,Un appartement branché et conviviale. Super balcon en L avec plusieurs endroits pour se mettre à l'aise. Endroit accessible pour le métro ou à pied. Vue magique sur le mont Lycabettus. Un pied à terre parfait!
30038583,575996170,2019-12-12,31644576,Karin,Everything was good. Great communication with Dimitris and we also got some good tips on where to eat.
30038583,580112781,2019-12-22,229415787,Ελένη,"Πολύ όμορφος χώρος,με υπεροχή θέα αλλά όχι τόσο καλή επιλογή για τους χειμωνιάτικους μήνες. Το ένα κλιματιστικό ήταν χαλασμένο το είπαμε στον οικοδεσπότη αλλά δεν ανταποκρίθηκε. Ειχαμε ενημερωθεί ότι θα υπάρχουν ξύλα για το τζάκι,τα έφεραν το επόμενο βράδυ. Η κουζίνα έχει αρκετές ελλείψεις (π.χ τοστιέρα και γκαζάκι) και υπήρχε αρκετή σκόνη στο σαλόνι και την κουζίνα."
30038583,587480243,2020-01-03,33741706,Lilli,"Don´t rent the appartement in wintertime! There are so many windows that it is getting  supercold. Especially with the problem that you can not really use the heater. The heater is working automatically and the guest can not put it on. When we was there the heater was most of the time cold.The host has two airconditions in the appartemt which are blowing warm air but they are not strong enough to heat the whole appartment. <br/>For the Kamin the host had problems to offer wood. <br/>This flat will be for sure nice for summertime, but we had really bad experience with the coldness."

30038583,654167674,2020-08-21,18391314,Alexandre,"As we were not able to stay in this apartment due to a broken tube in the bathroom, we had to go to another place managed by Dimitris too which was less exciting that we had hope for for our first 3 days in Greece. But Dimitris helped a lot to manage this last minute solution and seemed nice even though we did not meet."

Super reactive, she answered at all my questions very fast and with precision. She was really agradable, she gave me some amazing adresses. And I am lucky, she offered me a drink in a wonderfull place for being the first guest of 2019 ! Really I had a good time in Athens and it was thanks to Eleana and her flat with his perfect view and location :) <br/><br/>Thank you so much !"
30039305,404481507,2019-01-24,136537909,Helene,"Chic flat in wonderful area of Athens. Close to Acropolis and other sights, safe and well lit streets with plenty of bars and restaurants, and a good mix of tourists and Athenians. Clean and comfortable. Check-in was smooth and Elenea responds quickly to any issue. I had a great stay in beautiful Athens!"
30039305,406026891,2019-01-28,236942035,Markos,"Εξαιρετική τοποθεσια και επικοινωνία. Ωραιος χώρος και πολυ ωραια θέα. Η καθαριότητα του τραγική. Οι πετσέτες και τα σεντόνια μύριζαν. Βουλομενο το μπανιο. Στο ντουλάπι και στο ψυγείο υπήρχαν χρησιμοποιημένα προϊόντα( νερο, τυρι, φρυγανιές). Βρωμικο  πάτωμα."
30039305,417694850,2019-02-28,1864592,Ji,Amazing host!  Location is GREAT!<br/>Eleana even offered to help me with doing my laundry when I just wanted to know where a laundry place was. <br/>Super accommodating. I came in a day earlier and had to figure out how to adjust my reservation - she took care of everything. <br/>Place is super cute and had everything I needed. <br/>I run and it had great locations to run around in the morning too!
30039305,435364229,2019-04-10,81078716,Rich,Small penthouse apartment in great downtown location. The type of place if 25 you would give your eye teeth for. But I am a lot older and still enjoyed. Suitable for one or two. Bit tired from lots of airnb but got all the facilities and great terrace to enjoy.
30039305,449967497,2019-05-08,22588224,Inbam,You’ll love this unit for the quiet as the streets are not loud even if it’s right behind the main street. Monastiriki Square & Metro are less than 5 minutes walk away. Many nice cafes in close proximity. The view is definitely something one would enjoy meals with when the weather is pleasant. <br/><br/>My only qualm was that there was no lock at the door from the inside which was the elevator. The cleaning lady thought I was leaving earlier and came in to clean up the unit. That got me a little uneasy as I realized anyone with an extra set of keys could come in at anytime as the door could not be locked from the inside.<br/><br/>Communication with Eleana was available until I got there. Then on I didn’t hear much from her until I messaged her for checkout instructions. The building does not have a washer/dryer machine. My queries regarding it were not responded to either so I had to collect my laundry and take to a DIY laundromat to get it done. Seeing that I booked this unit based on a few reasons which included the washer/dryer which was not there was a little disappointing.
30039305,452392029,2019-05-13,14590450,Tamara,Un appartement avec une vue superbe mais un équipement peu soigné.
30039305,460035807,2019-05-28,148512409,Barbara,Die Wohnung ist optimal für 2 Personen und liegt für viele Möglichkeiten fußläufig sehr gut. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und der Ausblick zur Akropolis ist jeden Tag umwerfend. Wir kommen gerne wieder
30039305,461735005,2019-06-01,209234735,Miruna,"It's the second time we visited Athens and it's great, lovely city.<br/><br/>Regarding this apartment where we stayed for 4 nights.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Beautiful view<br/>- Big apartment, spacious<br/>- Big terrace overlooking the Acropolis<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- No hairdryer<br/>- The terrace has nothing on it except for 2 broken chairs, 1 broken bench and 1 small table; the terrace is pretty useless because you don't have where to sit comfortably<br/>- The bed was broken, we had to fix it 2 or 3 times before we could sleep on it<br/>- We found 4-5 towels that were filthy and smelled like they were never washed<br/>- The whole apartment was filthy, the bathroom had a lot of dust and hair on the ground, the kitchen had many small dead bugs, the windows looked terrible and really dirty<br/>- The neighborhood is full of abandoned houses, homeless people<br/>- The apartment gets really hot so you have to sleep with the windows open<br/>- The bedroom window is broken and wont shut/open<br/>- If you sleep with the window open there is a lot of noise from the street<br/>- The communication with the host was terrible, before arriving we had to call her because she did not respond to the message on airbnb; before leaving she said nothing about where to leave the key unless we asked her first; this is the only time we spoke, she said nothing else during our stay<br/><br/>The price we paid was pretty high for the services and how the place looked. The only good thing is the view.<br/><br/>In conclusion: The apartment was really dirty and high priced for only a view (there are other places to stay with a view)."
30039305,462504123,2019-06-02,9340127,Paul,"This loft is located close to the Acropolis in a neighborhood that is still a bit gritty, but I felt safe walking around on my own. The streets around the apartment are great for nightlife, with plenty of bars and restaurants, and there are plenty of cafes to grab a coffee in the morning. I found it really cool that the main way to get into the apartment is by taking an elevator straight into the apartment, but it took a bit of working out how to lock/unlock the apartment door from within the elevator.<br/><br/>The loft needed a good cleaning, as the floors were pretty dirty/dusty, and there were dozens of ants by the bathroom coming out from between the tiles and hardwood floor. Thankfully I found some ant spray under the kitchen sink and sprayed to kill the ants, but the host/manager should have noticed and taken care of this before I checked in. The loft also needs some maintenance: several of the light fixtures didn't work, the patio table shown in the photos was broken in half, and the futon in the living area felt like it had no cushioning at all.<br/><br/>While the view of the Acropolis is great, the photos don't show that the patio right next to the loft's patio has a bunch of junk stored on it (like an old, dingy bed) and the apartment in the building between the loft and the Acropolis appears to be owned by a hoarder, as there is tons of junk and trash stored outside. This does ruin the view of the Acropolis during the day, though it's not noticeable at night, thankfully. It was nice to sit out relaxing at night on the patio, listening to the sounds of the restaurants on the street below, and looking at the Acropolis."

30039305,475963404,2019-06-25,185962016,Blake,"The apartment is in a great location but the WiFi did not work very well and the apartment could have been better maintained. In the pictures it shows an outdoor table and seating on the patio, but when we arrived the outside table was broken in half, and there was a wooden bench that was also broken. The apartment is in a very good location though and the back patio area has a very nice view of the Acropolis."
30039305,484086677,2019-07-08,74954923,Hind,"The apartment was very central close to all the places we needed to go. The view was great on the acropolis, we loved it."

Lots of restaurants right there and an easy walk to many places. I highly recommend staying at this place if you want to experience Athens and all the wonderful city has to offer. You can spend the morning exploring all that Athens has to offer, go back and rest in the middle of the afternoon, then out again for more sightseeing, late dinner, etc. A great way to experience Athens."
30039305,500977846,2019-08-03,35904261,Perrine,The appart is very well located in a very lively environnement and few minutes walking from many interesting sightseeing places.<br/>It is clean and the view from the terrace is amazing! <br/>A very good choice to enjoy your stay in Athens. <br/>And the manager of the flat is really reactive when you ask something and very helpful if you have a problem.
30039305,503651920,2019-08-06,52421803,Jay,This is an absolutely perfect location to stay in Athens. Very close to the metro and walking distance from the local market and the acropolis. <br/><br/>The apartment has a fantastic balcony where you can relax and enjoy the sun and the sunset with no disturbances. Would definitely stay there again and very highly recommend.
30039305,518696751,2019-08-27,41142406,Rosie,"I couldn't recommend this accommodation enough. We initially had some problems checking in, but Eleana was quick to respond and the issue was resolved very promptly. The location is incredible, there are loads of amazing bars and restaurants all within walking distance (some literally next door) to the apartment. My favourite thing in particular was the balcony area, as I truly enjoyed soaking up the sun with fantastic views of the acropolis."

Recommend you take up elenas advice and get her to book a taxi for you if you don’t want to use public transport ."

The flat was very convenient, we have requested a baby cot and it was provided to us. Eleana was very reactive and nice. Hope we can come back again :-)"
30039305,545423746,2019-10-12,175730328,Eric,Les photos sont conformes à l'endroit. Nous avions une belle vue tel que sur les photos. Plusieurs restaurant à proximité tout près de la ville et des activites
30039305,554884152,2019-10-27,34109726,Andrea,The apartment is in a very good location.  The large terrace overlooking the Acropolis is beautiful.  The kitchen appliances are not all working and the cleanliness is not as good.  But we enjoyed it.

The view from the roof was just stunning and we had a really good time. Eleana was also very helpful and answered our questions fast. The location of the apartment couldn't be any better!

30039305,705302414,2020-10-31,102120224,Antoine,"The photos shown are not exactly what we discovered during arrival. It seemed as if the appartment has not been cleaned for a while. In the bathroom were hairs, on the tables and under the fourniture was dust. The plates didn't seem very clean either. All in all, the cleaniness was not given at all, that was very disappointing. <br/>However, we can say that the terasse was great with a beautiful view and a nice open space.<br/>When you want to stay there, you should know that the appartment is located in the bar street. The walls of the appartment were not the thickest ones, which means that you will hear the music and talking from the street during the night.<br/>All in all, we can not exactly recommend this appartment, eventhough the terrasse was really nice, the appartement was very dirty, which didn't feel confortable."

30039305,387445572543340858,2021-06-18,236986880,Marie,"C'est appartement est un réelle surprise ! Malheureusement, pas dans le bons sens du terme....<br/><br/>En toute objectivité :<br/><br/>L'appartement est très bien situé, en centre ville, dans quartier vivant et plein de charme.<br/>L'arrivée est aisée, bien expliquée. Il en est de même pour le départ.<br/><br/>Concernant l'appartement en lui même...<br/>Ce qui a le plus de charme ; les photos de l'annonce. Ca s'arrête là.<br/><br/>Nous avons découvert un appartement bien différent de ce à quoi nous nous attendions. <br/><br/>Le ménage est partiellement fait. Et je pèse mes mots. <br/><br/>La cuisine ""équipée"" n'en a que le mot : plaques électriques hors d'âge, dont une défaillante. La seule poêle disponible présente une couche de graisse incrustée impressionnante. La passoire a un trou en plein fond, idéal pour égoutter vos pates et riz. La vaisselle est a relaver.<br/>Le seul condiment disponible est du sel. Vous ne trouverez rien d'autre de consommable.  Quoique maintenant, grâce à nous vous aurez accès à de l'huile d'olive et du vinaigre.<br/><br/>Le canapé est défoncé et se pâme de magnifiques et énormes auréoles de fluides corporels humains (""habilement"" caché sous un plaid IKEA)<br/><br/>Le sommier du lit est rafistolé au scoth. Le matelas, ne possédant de protège matelas, vous offre aussi quelques belles surprises de traces humaines.<br/><br/>La salle de bain n'a pas connu le franc frottement d'une éponge depuis un moment. <br/><br/>La terrasse reçoit les vestiges des anciens meubles cassées de l'appartement.<br/>Juste à côté vous aurez vue sur un vieux lit abandonné. Ne loupez pas non plus la vue depuis la chambre ; un magnifique matelas pourri tranquillement sur la terrasse.<br/><br/>Vous aurez la joie de découvrir plein de sympathiques locataires ; une colonie de fourmis vit avec vous. Elles n'en restent pas moins très polies et se cantonnent à la cuisine.<br/><br/>Vous aurez droit à deux ampoules pour cinq éclairages et devrez donc changer votre ampoule de luminaire en fonction de l'intensité lumineuse désirée.<br/><br/>Concernant le WIFI : Il y'a un seul modem pour tout l'immeuble. Vous aurez donc un routeur défaillant. Pour notre part, même pas assez de connexion pour que la TV puisse se connecter. Sur nos téléphones un accès à internet extrêmement lent.<br/><br/>Le store de la terrasse est enlevé et posé à terre. Notre hôte nous avais prévenu qu'à cause d'un orage électrique récent, il avait été cassé. Curieusement, les autres terrasses de l'immeuble on vécu la même avarie.<br/>Selon notre hôte, c'est également un de ces fameux orages électriques Athéniens qui aurait fait sauter le WIFI.<br/><br/>Il est très mal isolé, la chaleur s'y fait beaucoup ressentir. Heureusement les deux climatisations sont fonctionnelles. Un odeur de renfermé y règne.<br/><br/>Il est extrêmement lumineux.  La moitiés des stores sont cassés et ceux restant font très mal leur travail.<br/><br/>Pour résumer, vous apprécierez beaucoup le quartier. Et heureusement, car avec cet appartement, ce que vous apprécierez le plus, c'est en sortir !"

AC worked well, which was important as it was 92 degrees F while we are there and returning to a cool apartment after climbing the hot Acropolis was very nice.  Location so close to Syntagma square was great for getting to key historic sites on foot.  Kitchen and one bathroom were small, but well equipped. I would rent again here!   thanks"

It's around the corner from syntagma square, in the famous street, and downstairs is Lv Dior! Opposite the Attica, there are four large rooms, each room can live two people, I like too much Fenia  thank you dear"
30052958,543624666,2019-10-08,78368785,Nicholas,"Place was nicely furnished and included great amenities like cooker and microwave etc. Stable and fast WiFi included, which was a great perk to have. Location was convenient and a stone’s throw away from a supermarket, as well as the branded shopping area. Only gripe was the noise from the club in the area (be warned if you are staying there during the weekends), which was deafening for the road-facing rooms."

30052958,555808304,2019-10-28,94845143,Gosia,"Very lovely spacious  apartment, we had all we need and nothing to fault there. Great location, walking distance to pretty much all attractions and easy access to and from Airport. The only downside was the noise from the nearby night club( I believe recently open ,hopefully not for long for the sake of the residents!). Very loud music throughout the night till 6am on Thursday and Friday! Be prepared, earplugs and good wine ( to knock yourself out ) for a better night sleep."
30052958,563226695,2019-11-12,25600686,Catherine,Très bel appartement très bien situé pour les visites et près du métro. Fenia est très accueillante et la communication est parfaite . Le seul point négatif serait la rue qui est très bruyante. Sinon tout est ok

30052958,584591811,2019-12-30,33157741,Jeremy,"This apartment is perfectly located to many prime areas in Athens. We were able to easily walk to the Kolonaki, Akropolis, Plaka, Panathenaic Stadium, and parliament for the hourly changing of the guard. Fenia was very responsive when we couldn’t figure out how to get more hot water! There are many cafes, restaurants and shops around. It’s also very easy to hail a taxi right outside the front door. <br/><br/>Do take note that the apartment is on a busy street and from Thursday to Sunday there is a nightclub that plays very loud music until 4:30 am. It didn’t bother most of us and those staying in the back bedrooms didn’t hear it at all. I would definitely recommend staying here."

We had a group of 4 adults and 4 kids and we really enjoyed the spacious apartment.  Everyone had plenty of space.   The best thing was the location as the apartment is located steps away from everything.   The check in was easy and AC worked well.   Thank you!

The house has everything you need in the bathrooms, the washer/dryer works perfectly and Fenia leaves the necessary to do laundry.  There is a dishwasher also!!!  The place is well decorated,  very nice, clean and near everything you need (drugstore across the street, supermarket one street ahead, plenty of cafe and restaurants in the back street, and very near to metro and bus stations,  although you don’t need that since you can walk in minutes to the center and find your own way). We recommend that you can stay here and find a safe, quiet  and clean environment for your vacations,"

Never felt ill at ease with my booking.<br/><br/>The location is splendid but if you're a light sleeper that sleeps in early you should pick somewhere else! Theres bustling night life and it is very accessible to Syntagma etc.

The plus point is that the host actually provides the guest with Netflix.<br/><br/>The host is also very particular about cleanliness. We can tell that he puts in alot of effort to maintain the cleanliness of the apartment.<br/><br/>He also welcomed us at the gate even though we reached at 11pm.<br/><br/>The apartment may be a little bit small for some people but the space is sufficient for us.<br/><br/>The apartment is located near a bar so it may be a bit too noisy for some people.<br/><br/>In general, we had a pleasant stay at this apartment."

It's a bit small yes, but perfect for two people (although I'd recommend you're quite ""close"" with whoever you're travelling with, as the bathroom doesn't give much privacy). We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"

30056009,474381742,2019-06-23,13642199,Jonathan,Yiannis is a nice host and welcomed us at the place. The apartment was as advertised and clean. Location was good and near the old town. One thing to take note is that the flush is a little loud at times.

Our check-in was very straightforward, with clear communication from our host. If we needed anything throughout our stay, our host arrived within 20 minutes. The place is quite small, however it can be comfortable for 2 acquainted people. Make sure to get clear instructions on the water boiler, as you need to turn it on for about 20 minutes before showering. Also, the place has a TV with Netflix which was fantastic! All around, this was a great place to stay in Central Athens."

We enjoyed meeting him."
30056009,506050519,2019-08-10,269807026,Yaelin,호스트님은 좋아요! 체크인이 거의 밤 12시였는데도 불구하고 친절하게 해주셨습니다. 아크로폴리스랑은 거리가 좀 있지만 공항버스 타는 곳과 쇼핑거리랑 가까웠고 근처에 음식점이 많아서 좋았습니다. 침대도 편안하고 숙소에 물도 있습니당. 아쉬운 점은 와이파이가 너무 느려요. 그냥 안됩니다. 확실하지는 않지만 공유기가 방에 없고 같은 층에 있는 다른 방이랑 쉐어하는 것 같더라구요. 그리고 소음이 좀 있어요. 정확히 어디서 나는지는 모르겠지만 물을 쓸 때마다 소리가 나서 좀 많이 시끄러워요ㅜㅜ 화장실 문은 반투명? 느낌이라서 불편하실 수도 있습니다. 그리고 넓지는 않아서 28인치 캐리어 두개 간신히 폈어요ㅜㅜ
30056009,508587214,2019-08-13,85699977,Katie,"The host was very kind and accommodating for us, despite our late check in! He had great communication with us before, during, and after our stay to ensure it was great. We had some issues with WiFi and bathroom smell, but otherwise it was just as advertised and we had a great stay. Thanks!"

It was exceptionally small - you’d want to be pretty close to the person you’re traveling with! It was also a little noisy at night but that’s what you’d expect in a city center location. All in all, we had a good stay here"
30056009,527218659,2019-09-10,247847115,Joao Paulo,"Adoramos Atenas, e a receptividade do anfitrião foi espetacular! O quarto é um pouco menor do que aparenta nas fotos, mas a decoração, limpeza e cuidado com os detalhes, valoriza em muito o local. Yiannis é muito simpático, e mesmo eu e minha esposa tendo um inglês fraco, ele pacientemente teve tanta atenção e cuidado nas explicações em nossa chegada, que entendemos praticamente tudo. A localização é ótima! Perto de tudo, e dá para fazer tudo a pé. Com certeza indicamos essa hospedagem para qualquer pessoa que queira conhecer Atenas."

I had a late flight and he allowed us to leave our bags until our departure time. We got great coffee and a sparkling room; lots of PH and towels. Location couldn’t be better since all the major attractions are at a walking distance. I highly recommend his place."
30056009,531330905,2019-09-17,15619238,Stephen,"Exactly as advertised! Yiannis made sure we were able to check in with no fuss, flexibly accommodated us, and there were no issues with the space. Great location, too! Would definitely recommend to others."

Great experience overall, would definitely visit again!"

We had such a good time staying here due to the convenient location (just 4 minutes walk to Syntagma square!) and the lovely eateries all around. Yiannis gave great food recommendations and went above and beyond in his duties as a host. I would highly recommend his place if you were ever in Athens. I know other comments talked about the noise from the bar, but the bar noise wasn’t a problem for us, we barely noticed it."

The water tank is quite loud whenever the shower or sink is running or toilet is flushed so it may be bothersome to some, however, we did not feel it was that much of an issue. We had some issues with the key getting stuck in the door whenever locking/unlocking but it usually took just a few minutes of shimmying to work.

You are so close to Syntagma square that you can walk to all the main museums, attractions, archaeological sites and restaurants . The flat is cozy, spotless and modern, Ioannis is a great host and you can reach him anytime."

Ubicato in una posizione strategica per raggiungere i luoghi di principale interesse turistico della città. Il proprietario si è mostrato molto disponibile e gentile, veloce nelle risposte ed ospitale.<br/>Siamo molto soddisfatti del servizio e del soggiorno ad Atene! Lo consigliamo veramente"

30057760,440791886,2019-04-21,103217800,Enrique,"Es un lugar bien ubicado, a pocos minutos caminando de todos lados, y muy bien equipado. Mucha hospitalidad por parte de Ioannis. Responsable y puntual. Lamentablemente, la ventana da a la calle donde hay mucha vida nocturna, por ende mucho ruido en la noche, al menos el fin de semana. Indispensable llevar  tapones para los oídos."
30057760,442320437,2019-04-23,248385045,Anastasio,Η θέση τέλεια. Πολύ καλή καθαριότητα.
30057760,449273037,2019-05-06,22933424,Delia,Excelente. Yannis es muy atento y nos orientó muy bien. Gracias Yannis.  Mi recomendación a futuros huéspedes llevar tapones para dormir. Demasiada fiesta en la calle de noche.
30057760,450371057,2019-05-09,65707481,Xenia,"Die Wohnung ist sauber und schön eingerichtet. Das Inventar entspricht den Bildern in der Vorstellung. Yiannis war immer erreichbar und hat schnell auf Nachrichten regiert. Bei Ankunft hat er alles zu der Wohnung erklärt und gezeigt, was sehr nett war. Es gibt sogar ein paar Extras, wie Tee und Kaffee, Schokolade oder Wasser, was wirklich sehr nett ist. <br/>Monastiraki ist ein sehr belebtes Viertel, das muss man im Hinterkopf behalten. Obwohl die Wohnung in einer Seitenstraße liegt, ist es Nachts doch lauter. Wer Ruhe haben möchte, sollte sich etwas mehr Abseits buchen."
30057760,453531963,2019-05-16,9306308,Stanford,"Compact but adequate space for 2 persons. Good Wi-Fi, good AC, no cooking facility but has microwave and fridge. The IKEA furniture and dishes looked new. Elevator worked fine. Would stay again."
30057760,457943543,2019-05-25,119120544,Emilie,Apparemment très bien situé. Déco sympa. Yannis est très accueillant et serviable. Je recommande. Le seul petit bémol est éventuellement le bruit lié à la vie nocturne de la rue.
30057760,459194160,2019-05-27,62616268,Amy,Yannis is a super nice host! He came to meet us and show us the place on the day of arrival and answer our questions promptly!<br/>The place was cozy and nice! Safe location! Just a bit noisy at night as there are bars downstairs!
30057760,462681318,2019-06-02,154834462,Antreas,"Πραγματικά είναι ένα διαμέρισμα με πάρα πολύ καλές παροχές (κυριολεκτικά έχει τα πάντα), πολύ καθαρό, με τοποθεσία στο κέντρο, πολύ κοντά σε Ερμού και μετρό Συντάγματος και με ένα οικοδεσπότη άψογο, ευγενικό και πολύ εξυπηρετικό. Πλην όμως, λόγω της τοποθεσίας του και μάλλον της πολύ κακής ηχομόνωσης του τα βράδια μπορείς να κοιμηθείς μόνο αφού κλείσει η μουσική στο μπαρ που βρίσκεται σχεδόν από κάτω. Σαββάτο βράδυ έγινε 5.15 να κλείσει η μουσική και να μπορέσουμε να κοιμηθούμε.."

30057760,472268492,2019-06-19,105622539,Candela,"This is a great place to stay while in Athens as the location is perfect. Is it walking distance to most tourist attractions and the area is very nice, lots of shopping and places to eat nearby. It is also very close to public transport and buses to Cape Sunion. The unit is small but had everything we needed. It was very clean and was newly renovated. Only issue is that there is contruction going on in the building (as of June 2019) and one morning we woke up at 5.30 am to really loud drilling noises. The rest of our 3 day stay was ok, some minor noises only. Would really recommend staying here!"
30057760,473177616,2019-06-21,268059397,Georgios,Very exciting experience. Surely it is worth the price.
30057760,477357910,2019-06-28,15625332,Chris,"Recommended! Friendly host, great location, a clean and comfortable studio!<br/><br/>We stayed here for 2 nights while we explored Athens. Yiannis is attentive, responds quickly, and is quite friendly.<br/>The studio is very clean and well kept. It exceeded our expectations. It is located among small walking streets with some great little bars, cafes, and stores to explore.<br/>Only caution: it can be a little loud if you are used to very quiet areas. It has well built double glazing to help against this, and aircon so don't worry about getting too hot.<br/><br/>We would definitely book this again!"
30057760,480125803,2019-07-02,39967442,Beenie,"Place is clean, nice location. But if you want a place where you can actually sleep don't stay here. Clubs and bars around this air bnb play music till 6 am in the morning on Saturdays, and till 4 am on Sundays and 3 am on the other days."

Η εξυπηρέτηση είναι τέλεια και ο ιδιοκτήτης κάνει ο,τι περνάει απο το χέρι του για να διευκολύνει την διαμονή. Το μονάδικό πρόβλημα είναι η φασαρία απο τα μαγαζιά, το οποίο αποτέλεσαι πρόβλημα μόνο ένα βράδυ."
30057760,494420936,2019-07-24,30538675,Dylan,"Amazing communication by Yiannis. We had a late flight from Crete and he met us at apartment at 2 am. Apartment was perfect with good location, AC, quiet, and a good shower. Thanks!"

30057760,504685524,2019-08-08,84510384,Christine,"Nice small place close to center of Athens. Very walkable. On a street with a lot of bars so it could be a little noisy late at night. Yiannis was a great host, he left us water bottles and there was an espresso machine available with espresso. Has AC and Wi-Fi. <br/><br/>The only downside is there was a funny smell in the apartment, possibly coming from the AC. But it wasn’t bad and I still rate this place 5 stars, would stay again!"

30057760,514382325,2019-08-21,61053237,Mónica,"Apartamento céntrico, moderno y limpio. Buena relación calidad precio. El anfitrión se preocupó de cómo llegábamos y de darnos  las indicaciones que necesitábamos a nuestra llegada a Atenas. <br/>No hace falta moverse en transporte público para visitar los principales lugares de Atenas, ya que está en el centro. <br/>Alrededor hay sitios para cenar y tomar una copa que están abiertos hasta tarde, y se puede desayunar a primera hora en varios sitios también cercanos."

30057760,523737862,2019-09-04,193829220,Chloe,"The space is really nice and perfect for two people. It’s in in a good location with plenty of food options around and lots of shops nearby. We walked to all the sites but there’s also public transport very close as well. The apartment is also very secure. <br/><br/>There was some noise on the Saturday night from the bar a few doors up but this didn’t bother us and we expected a bit of noise being in that area anyway. <br/><br/>Yiannis was lovely and Antonis who did our check in was kind enough to meet us at 1am when our flight was delayed, we were also left some bottles of water in the fridge which was a nice touch."

Everything was as expected, very good location, close to everything you would want to do in Athens, close to Syntagma square, shuttle bus station for the airport. Early check-in was also possible and much appreciated. Saturday night was a little noisy as there was a club/bar downstairs."

Lication is great and everything is nearby in walking distance, big choice of cafes, restaurants and good public transportation. Yannis is a great host and was responding very quickly to all our questions and even organized some extra things for us like iron. The only point i want to mention is that i agree with everybody else’s comments that the street can be quite loud especially on Friday and Saturday evening and as the place is on 2nd floor you can hear all the noise from the restaurants downstairs. For us this was not very disturbing but good to keep in mind. Overall great experience."
30057760,536147719,2019-09-26,29461841,Orel,The hospitality I received was amazing! The airport lost my suitcase and Yiannis was so helpful in recovering it since I did not have a Greek phone. Other than all the extra help and support the place was sweet and comfortable in a great location. I had a great time and would stay again!

Οποιοσδήποτε θέλει μπαίνει μέσα στην πολυκατοικία και ανεβαίνει τις σκαλες ή μπαίνει στο πανάρχαιο ασανσέρ. Κυριολεκτικά, η πόρτα του ασανσέρ ήταν ένα σιδερένιο πλαίσιο με σίτα, σκισμένη κιόλας. Πήγα στο διαμέρισμα και ενώ φαινομενικά όλα δείχναν ενταξει μέσα, κοιτώντας λίγο καλύτερα, είδα τρίχες στο πάτωμα παντού, τα σεντόνια δεν πρέπει να ήταν καθαρά, υπήρχαν τρίχες και εκεί, στρωμένο βιαστικά, μόνο οι πετσέτες ήταν σε συσκευασία κλεισμένες. Μέχρι και κάτι κολλημένα υγρά στο πάτωμα υπήρχαν. <br/>Το μπάνιο επίσης δεν ήταν επαρκώς καθαρό. Είχε ένα σύστημα αποχέτευσης πίσω από την τουαλετα που κάθε τόσο έκανε έναν πολυ δυνατό θόρυβο και ήταν αρκετά ενοχλητικό. Η μια καρέκλα της κουζίνας ήταν χαλασμένη, επομένως μόνο στη μια καρέκλα μπορούσες να καθίσεις. <br/><br/>Ο οικοδεσπότης δεν απαντούσε στα μηνύματα μου με τις φωτογραφίες που του είχα στείλει, με αποτέλεσμα να προσπαθώ να επικοινωνήσω με την Airbnb στο εξωτερικό και μετά από 5 ώρες που με άφησαν να περιμένω στο διαμέρισμα σα να είμαι τιμωρία, ακύρωσαν την κράτηση εφόσον δεν είχαν ανταπόκριση από τον οικοδεσπότη και έφυγα από το διαμέρισμα. Τον οικοδεσπότη τον βρήκα μετά από πολλες ώρες στο τηλ και όταν απάντησε μας ρώτησε που βρήκαμε το τηλέφωνο του. Στο προφίλ του είχε δηλώσει έναν άλλο αριθμό που δεν ήταν αυτός που διαχειριζόταν το διαμέρισμα και εκείνος μας έδωσε το τηλέφωνο του. <br/>Αν και φαινομενικά το διαμέρισμα έδειχνε ωραίο, όλα τα άλλα ήταν απογοητευτικά. <br/>Η καθαριότητα είναι το Α και το Ω σε έναν χώρο που φιλοξενείται κόσμος. <br/><br/>Δεν πρόκειται να το επισκεφτούμε ξανά."

It is located a few minutes from the characteristic districts of Plaka and Monastiraki and from the wonderful Acropolis and museums, close to Syntagma square and   National Garden. The street of the apartment has many nice places to eat and drink, it's a bit noisy but full of life. Ioannis is a great host, kind, caring, from the beginning to the end of your holiday."
30058424,444062179,2019-04-27,90324806,Amanda,"The appartment is great. Its fantastically located, in a neighborhood full of bars, restaurants and shops. It is also very near to syntagma square and public transportion, although we didnt even use it because you can easily walk almost everywhere. It can get loud at night, because the street is very alive and there are a lot of bars and restaurants, so i recommend bringing some earplugs if you have light sleep (like me). But thats a tiny detail, because the appartment is really beautiful and comfortable, and the host is really nice and helpful. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this appartment and i would stay here again."

30058424,487707887,2019-07-14,122618269,Hannah,Lovely little flat in an excellent location for seeing all the sights. Really clean etc and Yiannis responded quickly to any questions.
30058424,489650117,2019-07-17,271763303,Anne,"Many thanks to Yianni for a very pleasant, relaxing stay in his well appointed and super centrally located appartment! Highly recommended."
30058424,493231264,2019-07-22,9082173,Artemis,Just perfect !!
30058424,499775043,2019-08-01,35205686,Julia,"The appartment was in a very good spot in Athens, walking distance from everywhere and safety area. Yiannis was helpful and gave us many tips about places to see and visit. Appartment was bigger than we expected and very nice in every way. I recommend to stay here!"
30058424,502920834,2019-08-05,170000066,Magali,L’appartement est très bien situé malgré quelques nuisances sonores tard dans la nuit dû au bar situé à proximité mais emplacement parfait pour visiter Athenes <br/>Yannis est un super hôte attentif et très disponible. Il est de bon conseil.<br/><br/>Je recommande fortement.
30058424,506152643,2019-08-10,214775687,Nick,Yiannis was very friendly and helpful with some local tips on where to eat and what to do.
30058424,512011601,2019-08-18,8075162,Erin,This was a great location for walking around the city center. The bed was very comfortable and it felt easy to be at home with several amenities like a kitchenette and WiFi. The WiFi speed was about 8mbps when I tested which is sufficient to do video calls / some remote work. All over Athens I had internet issues so it was nice to have reliable connection in my air bnb. Would def recommend!
30058424,518673206,2019-08-27,253598449,Laura,"From the first moment we arrived st the appartment and Yannis was waiting for us, everything has been great! We asked for a place to keep our luggage the last day and change clothes before leaving to the airport and he provided these with no extra cost! <br/>Whenever friends of us will travel to Athens we will defenitely recommend your place!<br/><br/>Besides all that, great location too!"
30058424,523662207,2019-09-04,53643367,Derek,"This place was fantastic! Right in the heart of the downtown area, close to everything you would want to do in Athens, and a straightforward bus ride or metro away from the airport. The check in was seamless as Yiannis’ partner met us after we got in from the airport. Yiannis’ hospitality was unmatched and he was extremely responsive. You won’t find a better place for the price!"
30058424,525046031,2019-09-07,31085993,Melody,"Yiannis was very responsive and easy to communicate w. Great location and in a converted office. Unique bathroom situation w water, but Yiannis explained it to us. If you’re a light sleeper, it could get a little loud outside from the street."
30058424,527076077,2019-09-10,272192981,Hector,"We had an amazing stay in this Suite. Location is perfect, right in the centre. Yannis has been an incredible host, helping us and answering to our messages really fast and kind! Would definitely recommend it"

30058424,533144412,2019-09-21,144920823,Shuang,Yiannis is very friendly and helpful. The apartment has very good location.
30058424,537241266,2019-09-28,246554879,Alan,"The accommodation was amazing. It was so nice to stay here. The host was incredibly nice when we met him and gave us very helpful tips on the local area. The accommodation had a great location and was close to everything, the metro was within ten minutes walk and you could walk to basically everything you'd want to see in at longest 30 minutes but most were much closer than this. The accommodation had lots of small touches that made it very nice. If I was to come back to Athens, I would like to stay in this accommodation again."
30058424,539345538,2019-10-01,195991532,Alexandros,"The apartment is very posh, modern, big and well equipped. Yiannis is very friendly and helpful. The location is excellent but very noisy at the weekend, so don’t forget your earplugs. We will definitely come again. Highly recommend!"
30058424,547427506,2019-10-15,85831392,Jim,"This apartment is very well located, just a few minutes walk from Syntagma Square, and about a 10 minute walk from Monastiraki. It's a nice spot, very convenient and quite safe, but you should be aware that there are several bars on the same street and, on some nights, they play music loudly and well into the wee small hours. We didn't have a problem with this, but if you need absolute silence to sleep you might want to take that into consideration. The apartment itself is nice and stylish, quite roomy for what is essentially a studio with a partitioned-off ""bedroom"". Plenty of cupboard/storage space, and well serviced by an elevator so easy to access. The quality of the fit-out is good, although some of the fixtures are a bit loose -- probably could use a tradesperson to go through the place -- but there are no real issues for a short-term rental. About the only surprising negative feature is the lack of hot water in the bathroom washbasin -- there is plenty of good hot water in the shower and at the kitchen sink, so it's surprising that the washbasin misses out. Yiannis was most helpful, both before we arrived with the communications and arrangements for check-in, and some thoughtful touches like a couple of bottles of water in the fridge, and some coffee pods. There was even an umbrella in the apartment -- a thoughtful touch. All-in-all, subject to the items mentioned above, an enjoyable experience and can recommend the place if you are looking for a very well located and comfortable stay for a few days in central Athens."

The host is very friendly and responsive, and responded to a last minute booking request in the middle of the night. He waited for us at the door when we arrived at the place, and have been providing warm welcome and helpful tips throughout the stay. The host also helped arranging taxi to the airport on our way out. Over all highly recommended!!"

30058424,409151392186045366,2021-07-18,18375226,Mario,"This is a flat in the heart of Athen. Attractions like Akropolis and the national garden are in walking distance. As this flat is central this is convenient to go out to attractions, restaurants or bars, but also means there's nightlife downstairs. Friday, Saturday and to some extend even Sunday you'll have noise until after 3am. The kitchen has no cooktop, but a microwave. You probably can't use the capsule coffee machine as you probably won't have capsules. Thats no issue as there are two nice coffee shows downstairs to help you start into the day.<br/>Working from there was convenient as the Wifi is fast enough for video conferencing and the AC keeps the flat cool."

The metro station was right across the street so when we weren’t walking we were able to do public transportation.  Because your so close to the square you do hear a little bit of traffic but surprisingly at night we didn’t have any trouble sleeping. We loved everything about our stay and can’t wait to return. Panagiotis was quick to respond to our inquiries as well which made things super easy during check in.

The place is completely spotless, really well designed, and less than a minute away from the Metro to Piraeus port and the Airport. The host was very responsive and provided clear instructions on how to access everything. We did find that the noise from the street was quite loud even with the windows fully shut, so I wouldn't recommend staying over a Friday or Saturday night. Other than this we had a great stay here and would very much recommend."

Αν και δεν υπήρξε συχνή επικοινωνία καθώς η διαμονή μας ήταν εξαιρετικά καλή, η κυρία Marzanna ήταν πάντα πρόθυμη να βοηθήσει. Το διαμέρισμα ειναι εξοπλισμένο με όλες τις απαραίτητες παροχές που χρειάζεται κάποιος, ενώ η τοποθεσία αποδείχτηκε αρκετά ήσυχη! Πολύ καλή επιλογή, ιδίως για όσους θέλουν να μείνουν για μεγάλο χρονικό διάστημα!"

Marzanna was very accommodating even after I had locked myself out of the building as I was leaving haha. She called the neighbour who then opened the main entrance door for me. Because of this, I was able to make my flight on time so thank you for that!"

Si trova su una delle arterie principali ma risulta comunque silenzioso grazie agli infissi insonorizzati. A 30 metri dal portone di casa ci sono fermate di bus e metro. Tutto perfetto insomma! Altamente raccomandato :)"
30097442,426147935,2019-03-20,80348685,Michael,"This Airbnb is clean, modern, and exactly as described in the listing. It’s also in a very good location - it’s about a 15 minute walk from the Acropolis, and there’s a delicious bakery across the street at which one can grab breakfast. The only slight inconvenience was that the water heater was a little small, so we had to space out our showers a bit. However, our hosts were incredibly friendly and eager to make sure we enjoyed every day of our stay. We would highly recommend staying here for your stay in Athens."

He asked a few times if there was anything he could do for us, he arranged the transport from the airport to the aparment.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is really nice, everything is as you would expect or even better. Overall a really wholehearted experience."

30097442,435682799,2019-04-11,57520486,Andria,"Niko and Christina's place is located just across the street from a subway stop AND a taxi station.  We were able to get checked in and walk around the area finding a local sports pub to watch soccer, grab some local food, and a coffee in the morning before heading out to view the Acropolis.<br/><br/>You can walk to both the Acropolis and the Panatheniac Stadium with no problems.  We took the train from the Airport and decided on catching a cab to the Ferry port of Piraeus early in the morning.  Both options were very easy to catch just outside the apartment.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is very clean and is as described.  We had a great stay in Athens."
30097442,437712558,2019-04-15,17625694,Simon,"The place is very stylish and modern, which i believe is great. Bed is great. The location is amazing for sightseeing and I believe the Koukaki district there is one of the best districts in Athens. It is not that commercial but still not too ""crapy""...;-). You can walk to the Akropolis. As the apartment is at a big street, we preferred to use the second bedroom in the back to sleep. As i believe the value for money for two people is even great. Thanks a"
30097442,438610990,2019-04-17,85300889,Joe,"We can’t say enough great things about this experience, especially our hosts. They went above and beyond in making sure we were taken care of including quick responses to our questions and also arranging transportation to and from the airport (even as early as 5am). The apartment had everything we needed and was conveniently located to everything. You get way more than you pay for and we would not hesitate to stay there again."

Además hay una estación del metro cruzando la calle que te lleva por varios de los lugares importantes, es la línea roja. Por último nunca hubo problemas con la comunicación y aunque no nos pudimos conocer ellos siempre respondieron de forma rápida. Definitivamente volvería a la casa de Nikos y Stratos!"

Very comfortable home with all the necessary amenities. similar to other reviews, one of the rooms are closer to the main road hence it is noisier at night but that’s not an issue as you can just sleep in the other room. Stratos has been helpful in arranging our transportation to and fro the airport."

Very close and walkable to the Acropolis and Plaka area. The check in process was very easy and they even arranged a driver to pick us up from the airport. The only thing that my family mentioned was that it was slightly noisy at night in the room facing the street as it is directly above a gas station. Other than that this place was perfect!"

Highly recommend that place"
30097442,470269447,2019-06-16,177040041,Nathan,"The apartment location is incredible and so easy to find. just a short walk to the Acropolis and right next to a metro stop. Parking is tight in Athens, but we had no issues parking on the street near the rental or use the not too expensive garage just below it. I couldn't be happier with the apartment it's spacious, decorated wonderfully, and has nice touches like a wireless charging pad for your phone. The rental was spotless and each room had a balacony that you could enjoy the city from or just let tons of natural light in. Check-in and Check-out is a breeze and Stratos was so responsive. Great place, great hosts, and i would stay here again any time I am in Athens."

I had to work over our time spent in Athens and this set up was perfect inside to help me get done what I needed to. My girlfriend and I were a bit surprised that the location was next to 2 busy roads that we had to cross daily going to and from the apt in order to get to the areas we wanted to visit. The acropolis view is a bit limited although you can see a sliver of it from the front balcony. This is a very comfortable spot and the hosts are great, just be prepared to deal with busy streets coming to and from the location."

Nikos and Christina, as well as their place, made a 3 day trip as seamless as possible!.  I couldn’t believe how quickly they responded to queries. What’s more,  they also organised transfers to and from the airport, as well as a late check out at late notice. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend their beautiful place to anyone that asked. Thank you Nikos and Christina, you made a great trip an awesome one!"

Viajo por trabajo muy a menudo, y procuro que el lugar elegido esté bien comunicado, tenga una buena conexión WiFi y que no sea ruidoso. Lo tiene todo.

You can walk to the city center or take public transport, the station is literally in front of the building. 10 minutes walk from the Acropolis.  The apartment is clean but not the cleanest one I've been to. It is very spacious with nice decorations and comfortable beds. Few things that we did not like during our stay is: there were no hangers (asked Stratos to bring some which he did on day 4), the drying rack was broken, light in the bathroom wasn't working (it has been reported to Stratos), not a single capsule for Nespresso machine, no salt, pans should be replaced since they are not usable. These are little things that didn't affect our stay that much but should be improved. Communication with Stratos was great and he was really helpful."

30098629,427200061761621992,2021-08-12,265970539,Iqra,Virginia is the loveliest you will ever encounter on AirBnB. I have previously stayed in Athens but this trip was far more pleasant due to her hospitality and help when we checked-in and needed any help. The location is also a plus as it is so close to the metro and only 2 stops away from many different attractions. The square is lovely with a variety of food options and some great crepes just round the corner! Overall an 11/10 stay. Thanks Virginia!

Not only was the apartment centrally located, very modern, and well designed, but also Virginia’s friendliness and helpfulness really made my trip to Athens.<br/><br/>The apartment is right next to many amazing bars, restaurants, and shops, and it’s only a short commute away from the city center. <br/><br/>Virginia was very accommodating from the first day we met when she showed me around her apartment and neighborhood to help me figure out if her place was a good fit for me. She sent me numerous tips and great locations when I booked, and she was always available to answer any and all of my questions. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Athens!!"

30099881,480158800,2019-07-02,37894669,Mary,"Large apartment with great view of Athens.  Spotlessly clean and within walking distance of many amenities.  The area it is situated in is close to the University and has a lot of political dissidents that come out at night.  That being said, never felt afraid to walk around at night as they kept mainly to themselves.  Excellent value and would recommend for budget conscious travelers."

The place is located just steps away from the oldest street in Athens which still has the same name. All the shops and restaurants are in walking distance. And right outside the most charming little square I’ve ever seen. No transportation will be needed as everything is in walking distance. You will have the chance to experience ancient Athens from this apartment. <br/><br/>The space it’s self has everything you need. The colors will calm you down after a day of walking and the view of the Acropolis will be mesmerizing.  The bed is comfy as well. Book this place and you will experience life as an Ancient Athenian. Just fantastic! Thank you Dana!"

Christos was super helpful, I had an issue with a shower at the beginning, he fixed it the same day. Kitchen was fully equipped, as I cooked at home it was very important. Location is safe, I never had any fear coming back home after 11 pm.  Right opposite the apartment there’s a big supermarket one of the best in Athens. Every Monday there’s a local farmer market just 3 blocks away from the apartment.<br/>The stay was super comfortable due to all these factors. If you are not looking for a place just 3 min away from Sintagma, then this is ideal place. Just again - huge thanks to the owner for my stay!!!!"

30123401,443072831,2019-04-25,101240179,Αντώνης,"Η διαμονή στο διαμέρισμα της Μαρίας ήταν πολύ καλή. Απο άποψη τοποθεσίας και τιμής το σπίτι είναι διαμάντι, κοντά στο κέντρο και σε κοντινή απόσταση με τις συγκοινωνίες. Όμως αυτό που αναγράφεται στις παροχές είναι σύνδεση wifi που στην πραγματικότητα ήταν περιορισμένα mobile data, δηλαδή ένα επιτρεπτό όριο κατανάλωσης δικτύου. Εάν εξαιρέσουμε αυτό, γενικά μείναμε πολύ ευχαριστημένοι."
30123401,453218777,2019-05-15,248882927,Wioleta,"Świetna lokalizacja. Bardzo blisko sklep ogólnospożywczy oraz wyśmienita piekarnia. Blisko do przystanku autobusowego oraz metra. Mieszkanie idealne na tygodniowy wyjazd. Jesteśmy bardzo zadowoleni z pobytu. Standard adekwatny do ceny. To mieszkanie jest idealne dla osób, które nastawiają się na intensywne zwiedzanie - tak jak my. Było ono dla nas bazą wypadową, do której przychodziliśmy na nocleg. Jeżeli ktoś jest bardzo czuły na dźwięki, polecam zaopatrzyć się w stopery do uszu, ponieważ mieszkanie jest na wysokim parterze, a ściany bardzo cienkie, więc generalnie wszystko słychać. Nam raczej nie przeszkadzało, bo po całym dniu wrażeń padaliśmy jak muchy. Właścicielka bardzo miła i komunikatywna. Generalnie bardzo polecamy."

Within walking distance of most attractions and a subway stop, very cute quiet neighborhood with a bakery and supermarket and several cafes and bars nearby.

After the 2 GB limit reach, you will not be able to use the internet.<br/>Further, it has a shops in the neighborhood and quite easy to reach the center. Walking to the center will take about 40 mins"
30123401,531243260,2019-09-17,269465624,Allende,"Apartamento en buenas condiciones, alejado del centro (20-30 mins). Durante mi estancia no pude hacer uso del wifi ya que no entendía como debia conectarme y no tuve respuesta de la anfitriona. En la cocina eche de menos un microondas aunque puedes calentar los platos en un horno y una cazuela que había, pero si querías hacerte unos filetes no había sartén."
30123401,533774089,2019-09-22,11652901,Anja,"The location is fine, 10 min walk to the airport metro and 30 min walk into the city center. <br/>In General the apartment is okay, especially for that price, however I need to criticise a few things :<br/>1.) Barhroom mats are disgusting<br/>2.) the bed is quit small, I am not sure whether 2 people can fit in there and also length wise it seemed really small. Also the mattress was quite uncomfortable - but I guess for 2 -3 nights it is fine. <br/>3.) one could here EVERYTHING what was going on in the house corridor. As the apartment is next to the entry door the opening and closing of the entry door is unbelievably loud - it seems like someone is inside the flat - which is quite creepy during night, as I woke up every time when the door opened/ closed and I am not a light sleeper.<br/>Also one could here everything through the windows, which was actually fine as there is not a lot of traffic on the streets.<br/><br/>The apartment is ok, considering the price and so on."
30123401,536267850,2019-09-26,51179911,Zayena,You get what you pay for. She was very kind. You only get 2gb of data to use. I would stay here again if I need a quiet place to stay. It’s a little to far from the center for me. 40 minute walk and 20 bus/train ride.

Maria was very fast with answering our questions and left some notes around the appartment. The block is situated outside of the centre but we did not mind having long walks since it was a vaccation. Also, we were not planning to cook a lot so one pot that was provided was enough."

You can just book it and not worry about nothing,  suitable for short or long stays for sure and a value for money. <br/>The area is  safe, nice and quiet, around you will find bakeries, take away places, cafes and supermarkets. Green areas, including the beautiful Lykavitos hill is walking distance. Syntagma and Monastiraki is also walking distance, I walked several times and really enjoyed, approx. 30 mins walk away. Metro station is ten minutes walk. <br/>The apartment is nicer and bigger than the pictures show, everything really clean, i have to say it was the cleanest Airbnd I ever stayed at. <br/>Maria is an excellent host, responds very quickly. <br/>I would definitely come back."

They were more than just hosts: they were family!! They even invited us to have lunch on 1st of January and shared Greek traditions. I strongly recommed this place and for sure will come back if I am ever back in Athens. Thanks so much ❤

30125320,410395823,2019-02-10,165983489,Riccardo Alessio,"Accoglienza, servizi, pulizia e alloggio impeccabili. Comunicazione, per così dire, impervia (per scarsa conoscenza dell'inglese degli host), ma in fin dei conti efficace. Christos ed Helena sono disponibili e premurosi.<br/>L'unica pecca, è la zona in cui è situato il quartiere di Athina, che, nonostante fosse sufficientemente vicino al centro (1-1,5 kilometri), risulta essere invivibile di sera/notte (mentre di giorno si può godere dei graffiti e dei negozi di strumenti che caratterizzano il quartiere), a causa della delinquenza. Consiglio di stare alla larga da via Themistokleus e dal parco in cui tale via sbocca. Consiglio inoltre, in caso in cui siate necessitati a passare per questo quartiere di sera/notte, di mantenervi sulla via principale Emmanouil Benaki."

A pesar de no hablar un inglés perfecto hemos podido comunicarnos con ellos perfectamente. El único inconveniente es la zona, que como ellos mismos advertían, es preferible ir con cuidado durante la noche debido a la inseguridad. Por todo lo demás, ha sido una gran experiencia y muy recomendable!!"

The room is very big and comfortable and it has its own bathroom and toilets. The whole house is beautiful and extremely clean. I was kindly offered coffee, fruit and cake every morning and nothing was a problem. The location was good for me as I could walk to my conference every day. It is within walking distance from the more touristic part of Athens and I’m glad I stayed there and discovered that side of the city too."

Location is also very good, we could get to the most interesting tourist places by foot or walk up to 30 minutes. I fully recommend that place for those how look for place you could feel like at home, greek home. Thank you for great stay in this beautiful city!"
30125320,436425137,2019-04-13,246792658,Debapriyo,"I got exactly what I wanted, a house that makes me feel like I am living with a Greek family in Athens. Beautifully done, clean and with great hosts. Ilias and Helen and the family were very nice and welcoming. The place is also located near Syntagma Square. The neighborhood is nice and peaceful. Although I was there for only one night I wish I could stay longer there."
30125320,440619739,2019-04-21,229215195,César David,"The house was always sparkling clean, and had all the amenities we needed. Spacious bedrooms with comfy beds. Ilias parents made our stay even better with their lovely hospitality. They will go out of their way to make help you with everything you need and make you feel at home. They are also interesting people to have a chat with but will give you all the privacy you need as well. Location is perfect, walking distance from 2 metro stations, with many shops, restaurants and bar in the area. If you prefer walking, you can reach Syntagma in about 20 minites. I hope to go back to Athens and would definitely stay at Ilia’s house again. Thanks for everything!"

Mir wurde sogar soviel Vertrauen entgegengebracht, dass ich das gesamte Haus für 5 Tage alleine bewohnen durfte und sogar meine Tochter durfte mit mir im Garten frühstücken. Es ist eine Oase und ein kleines Paradies inmitten der hektischen und lauten Stadt. Die Eltern von Illas sind einfach herzlich und super nett."

30125320,449630497,2019-05-07,22288788,Arijana,"From the airport easy to take the bus X95 to Sytagma Square. Bus tickets you can buy outside at a ticket counter. From this square you walk about 20 min. more to the Airbnb. Almost all the way straight. <br/><br/>Communication was good with Ilias. Gave us many recommendations around the area. We didn't meet Ilias by person, but his sweet parents were there upon check-in. They speak decent basic English, enough to communicate properly. They are very very friendly. <br/><br/>The Airbnb is spotted clean and has all the necessary needed for your stay. We just stayed for the evening/night unfortunately, so the only recommendation we have is the restaurant we tried, which is about 3 min. walking from the Airbnb and has the best kitchen, Ama Lachei. It has a beautiful inner garden and many places for dining. <br/><br/>Location is great. Easy from the airport and also closeby the sightseeing. We didn't had time, because of a delayed flight, but we are sure you are at the best spot. Safe in the evening as well. Recommended. <br/><br/>Thank you Ilias and parents for your hospitality and the delicious cake in the morning!"
30125320,450068925,2019-05-08,30621091,Ian,Christos and Helena were wonderful hosts. Blessing us with home made sweet treats and coffee. Their home is stunningly beautiful and comfortable . The taverna across the road and the bakery 2 streets down are fabulous! Take a taxi from Syntagma square. It's worth the 3 euros.  I wish we could have stayed longer.
30125320,451665547,2019-05-12,235964190,Sierra,"This is an outstanding accommodation! We loved this Airbnb so much! The host’s parents gave us local tips, and even walked us to his restaurant! We would definitely stay here again!"

Their house is located within easy walking distance to Athens' main attractions, also close to very convenient bus and metro lines, plus some of the nicest dining in Athens. An added luxury was having a bathroom to myself. This is now my go to accommodation in Athens!"
30125320,457073735,2019-05-23,120562468,Tiara,"Our stay was great. The home was on a quiet street, no motor vehicles — beautiful cafes and bakeries nearby. We found a cute Jazz bar, which we loved.  It's about 30-minute walk to the sites, but we liked that, we got to see the streets of Athens. And of course, our hosts were wonderful!"

30125320,461677716,2019-06-01,31894575,Alison,This place is worth it! My friend and I had such a good time interacting with the host and his parents! The rooms and toilet is also very clean. The location is quite good as well :)

It is located very close to bars, restaurants cafes and supermarkets and around a 30 minute walk to the centre. Ilias' parents were very warm and friendly and even gave me cold bottles of water and some fruit and biscuits which were very thoughtful touches. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
30125320,466239010,2019-06-09,2659138,Emma,"What a great find! Firstly, Ilias was quick to respond, and when we arrived, we were given some great restaurant advice, and we were even taken by Ilias's dad to a great local restaurant area, which turned out to be vibrant and full of authentic restaurants where the locals go. The room itself is huge with a comfortable bed. It's sparkling clean and we had the top floor to ourselves, so very private. Will come back again next time we're in Paris. It was made so much better by the location as we were living as the locals would love, and it's still only a 15 minute walk to the heart of Athens. Wonderful experience, thanks Ilias, and to your family."

The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and comfortable.

30125320,535351782,2019-09-24,7586509,Chris,"I booked a private room for my brother, sister and I with Ilias. I wasn’t quite sure who we were staying with, and found out it was his parents, which wasn’t a problem. Rather, it was a highlight of the trip. Eleni and Christos are incredibly hospitable hosts. They booked us a table at an incredible venue around the corner, offered many tips and were attentive yet aware of our personal space. Christos even took my sister out to buy her first bouzouki and Eleni made soup for my brother when he was ill.  I can’t speak more highly of them- they’re great people. Communication with Ilias was easy and he was on top of everything. <br/><br/>The house is also beautiful. There is plenty of space and everything is clean. Well styled too. <br/><br/>The street is quiet, only accessed by foot, so you are not kept up by traffic. <br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely recommend booking through Ilias. It also feels like a slightly more responsible option in respect to Exarchia’s relationship with Airbnb (rather tense); to stay with a local, rather a recently gutted, renovated and temporarily occupied flat in a neighborhood that has historically supported the displaced."
30125320,537104279,2019-09-28,11108227,Nikolas,Eine sehr schöne und authentische Unterkunft und freundliche Gastgeber!
30125320,540268142,2019-10-03,51473500,Asta,"The house is like an island in between the town buildings.<br/>All sightseeing are in 15-20 minutes on foot. Very close are nice coffees, restaurants, bakeries. The hosts are pleasant and attentive. the room and separate bathroom are perfectly clean.  <br/>We liked our stay very much. <br/>All the best to the hosts."
30125320,541394500,2019-10-05,211003009,Bryce,"It's a decent home, but the bed was stiff, and there was no air conditioning. Ilias didn't respond to any of my messages, and his parents, who are very nice, answered the door. It was hard to find because it's in a pedestrian alley."
30125320,544425076,2019-10-10,68031114,Michael,"Wonderful oasis in a noisy, hectic city. The house is located in a quiet side street in the district Exarchia. The city mountain Lykavittos is very close and offers a magnificent view over Athens. Also, the old town of Athens, I can easily visit on foot. Unfortunately, I did not meet Ilias personally. But his parents are great hosts and the house even more beautiful than to see in the photos... I was only here for 3 days - when I come back to Athens, I definitely come back to this house."
30125320,547520724,2019-10-15,29427152,Margaux,A stunning house. Ilias's parents are extremely generous and made us feel very much at home.
30125320,550694793,2019-10-19,6957673,Max,A comfortable room in a beautiful home and a vibrant neighborhood — highly recommended.
30125320,552743867,2019-10-22,44861951,Uta,The apartment really had everything that makes a  stay in Athens pleasant and the landlords support this positive impression by their warm and friendly nature.
30125320,554280241,2019-10-26,49591560,Helena,"Ilia’s parent (the hosts) are some<br/>of the most hospitable and warm people I’ve ever met. The location is perfect for those who enjoy walking and finding new paths to their destination each day. It takes about 20-30 minutes to walk to Plaka, but it is an enjoyable walk with plenty of cafes and bakeries along the way. I’m not sure if the mattress is comfortable enough to sleep on for more than a week. Other than that, I’d highly recommend this Airbnb. I had a fabulous time. Thank you Christos and Helen!"
30125320,557014575,2019-10-31,3578001,Karen,"A beautiful home in a quaint street and vibrant neighbourhood. Christos and Helen made me very welcome - the home is lovingly restored, just around the corner from many interesting cafes, bars, galleries etc. Easy to walk or 3 Euro taxi to centre. Loved it!"

The openness, the hospitality,... everything was better than I could wish for ! I enjoyed my stay even more because of the good care! really beautiful people, nice house, good breakfast, clean room,.... I would recommend this stay to everyone!"
30125320,569935255,2019-11-28,2367946,Mahsa,I am so glad that I booked this room. Ilias parantes are VERY nice and hospitable. I absolutely loved them. He was very nice too to come and help me out with my luggage during his lunch break. I loved the area. It is Bohemian and with lots of nice cafes and restaurants. The room can be a bit cold/fresh but all was GREAT. Thank you!
30125320,570721115,2019-11-30,266607674,Αλέξανδρος,Για ακόμα μια φορά κάτι πολύ παραπάνω από πολύ καλό !

30125320,604021018,2020-02-10,28120413,Laura,"Ilias manages the bookings but it’s his parents you’ll be staying with, and you couldn’t imagine a lovelier couple. They were fantastic hosts - so kind and thoughtful, happy to chat but also happy to give you your own space and privacy. This is Airbnb at its best - staying with true locals in their home and experiencing real life in a different city.<br/><br/>Plus, the house is very quiet considering its central location and the neighbourhood is one of the most interesting and vibrant in Athens. Great cafes and restaurants, unique little shops, and a fabulous street market on Saturday mornings. Don’t mind the graffiti everywhere - this is just superficial “decoration” from past years and no one even notices or cares about it anymore. It’s the people inside the buildings who make this such a great area to stay in."
30125320,607025323,2020-02-17,1482410,Florence,"My one week stay in this house was memorable. Ilias'parents are fantastic hosts. The house is big,  comfortable and beautiful. The room is big and quiet. Location was perfect for me, in a lively neighborhood, walking distance to  historic sites. Would be happy to come back."
30125320,608307821,2020-02-20,165966372,Thomas,Ilias’s home is a wonderful opportunity for anyone visiting Athens to feel like a welcome guest. <br/>My 12 year old son and I thoroughly enjoyed Ilias’ parents who were our hosts.

Although their house is located in Exarcheia, the street itself is quiet and pedestrian. The accommodation felt very authentic, was clean, and easily reachable by public transport. Can't recommend it more!"
30125320,461268587141406546,2021-09-28,22316074,Carlotta,"Definitely go for it! A lovely, charming, and artistic apartment in the heart of Exarchia.

It's located within the short walking distance to Acropolis, Acropolis museum etc. The apartment is lovely, it has a spacious living room and bedroom, with air-conditioning in both rooms. Its also nicely furnished, with small details to make you feel welcome. It even had some snacks, drinks in the fridge and things for breakfast, so you don't have to rush out of the apartment first thing in the morning.. Sophie was amazing, waiting for our arrival in the middle of the night (our flight was late), returning messages immediately and giving us all the info we needed. All in all a great stay, we loved it and we highly recommend it!!!"

30142523,366028781,2019-01-02,2450484,Demetrios,"This apartment is clean, safe, well-designed and in an easily accessible part of the city center.  The street has plenty of pleasant amenities (health food store, coffee shop, traditional grocer, cool boutiques and restaurants), and is within walking distance of several points of interest and transportation options.  Also, the street is surprisingly quiet at night despite its central location.<br/><br/>Kostantinos and his team provide excellent communication and service.  Check-in was hassle free and straightforward, the apartment’s pantry was stocked with just enough stuff to get us started before our first provisioning trip, and everything was exactly as we had expected, with a few thoughtful seasonal flourishes as thrown in.<br/><br/>Bonus points: there is a partially obstructed view of a corner of the Acropolis from one of the balconies, and my favorite souvlaki shop on earth is just around the corner."

It’s on a quiet street close to two organic supermarkets, if that’s your thing, and there’s also a healthy vegan restaurant on the corner, plus many others fantastic restaurants. I personally love greek food, so I have tons of favorites in the neighborhood. The apartment is  basically in a walking distance to everything. There are two subway lines, tram and a several buss stations close by, which makes it an easy transport to the beach and the port of Piraeus, that takes you to the islands. The  Upstreet team is very helpful and everything has gone smoothly. Can’t really think of anything negative to say.  Thank you!"

30142523,768490125,2021-06-10,43528513,Laura,"Amazing, spacious, modern apartment in one of the most vibrant streets in Athens! You're one step away from every possible activity; The Acropolis, restaurants, shops, metro+bus.<br/>The beds are very comfortable, the kitchen is equipped with everything you might need, there's two balconies, and enough daylight during the day. <br/>Important for me: There's also two organic supermarkets nearby.<br/>UPSTREET was highly responsive with every inquiry I had and made my stay the perfect starting point here in Athens.<br/>Bare in mind, that due to the location, there might be some bar- and restaurant-noise at night. As for me (an open window vs. AC-sleeper) that was noticable. But once you close the windows, they're isolated well.<br/>Also notable: This is one of the ""flatter"" areas in Athens, so it's very comfy to reach at any point. <br/>I'd definitely recommend this place + especially host for a stay here in Athens!"
30142523,388165708283156872,2021-06-19,280532106,Andrea,"Great experience <br/>Love the flat - great location, deco and comfort"

The location was great. Convenient and within a 15 min walk to all the main attractions. Cute cafes and a grocery store nearby.

Shown us the apartment, told about the area, gave us advice about places to see, where to go to eat etc. We couldn't expect more.<br/><br/>Apartment - it would be a long list of pros so let me just mention a few of them:<br/>- located downtown, right in the centre of events<br/>- stylish and well arranged<br/>- cozy, spacious and comfortable<br/>- well equipped (with board games, books etc.)<br/><br/>So let me say it again - amazing experience.<br/><br/>Thank you a lot!!"

30146528,362320298,2018-12-26,29765426,Chelsea,"The perfect spot! We LOVED our stay here. Close to the metro with a direct line to the airport, walkable to everything, great neighborhood with lots of cafes and food (not super touristy), and a safe, spacious and comfortable place. There is a nice view of an old church, and we enjoyed overhearing the service and bells on a few occasions. The host was very responsive, helpful, and flexible when our plans changed.  Even our local friends were impressed with the place! I would love to stay there again, and would recommend it to anyone visiting Athens."
30146528,363219447,2018-12-28,3741301,Elena,"The apartment is wonderfully decorated with its location being the best feature of all! Right into a wonderful area of Athens, called Psiri, full of restaurants and bars with live music. Minutes away from Monastiraki square with the amazing view of the Acropolis as well as minutes away from the central shopping street, Ermou Street. We couldn't be any happier. The place is spotless clean, perfect for relaxation, yet very inviting as a work space too. We worked on our laptops with no distractions whatsoever. The host was waiting for us on time, the communication was great and we couldn't have asked for anything more. We would definitely consider renting it again for a future stay."
30146528,367588424,2019-01-05,4115772,Ulia,"Apartment is super nice, the view and the design. It's located in the very centre, so all you may need is at easy reach including private parking, sights, cafes, bars, markets, etc. Super cool host with great communication skills also brings the apartment on top of my list and i travel a lot. The only thing is as we stayed in winter and there is no central heating in Athens, sometimes it was pretty cold at night, but there lots of warm blankets + one can use the AC to warm the place up. All in all - great value for the money."
30146528,400492385,2019-01-12,6633382,Svetlana,"Great apartment: stylish, clean, big and with an amazing view on the Church. Dimitris absolutely proofed his “super-host” status. Next time we are in Athens, we would book it again."

30146528,440653026,2019-04-21,123811067,Alexis,This was the perfect spot for our last night in Athens. There are two outdoor spaces with a nice little view. The place was right near the train station that has access to the port and the airport (perfect for us). There’s also tons of restaurants and local shops right around the corner. The only problem we had was the water randomly stopped in the middle of the night but was back shortly after. Most convenient and stylish place to stay in Athens!

30146528,481163903,2019-07-04,3375755,Brittany,This apartment was perfect for our three nights in Athens. It was easy to get here from the airport as you hop on the blue line and then get off at Monastiraki Square. It is about a 5 min walk with luggage from there. The apartment was very clean and the aircon worked wonderfully - which was important as it was in the 90s while we were there. Not only was this apt close to the metro but it was easy to walk to all the tourist places we wanted to go and local restaurants and bars. But don't worry - it was very quiet and away from all the noise. I would recommend staying here when you are in Athens.

The apartment is fully renovated with with Super nice touches, and it is both stylish and comfy. Lots of local tips provided by the host.

30146528,543090980,2019-10-07,6063139,Nimrod,"A great apartment in a great location!<br/>The place is clean and designed cool. There's a lot of room in the apartment.<br/>The apartment is on the third floor but there a small elevator so we could get all our laguage up easily.<br/>The kitchen isn't equipped enough for cooking a meal (has only one pot), but there's enough for eating breakfast.<br/>We were with a two years old baby and there was a baby cot waiting for us. We needed to put a side some stuff in the apartment to make it baby safe and friendly but it was easy.<br/>Thanks a lot!"
30146528,544128805,2019-10-09,5402139,Daniel,"This was located in the Psyri neighborhood of Athens which is very close to the Monastiraki neighborhood. It is also very close to the Metro. We arrived very late at night and Dimitris met us to give us the key the apartment. Checkin went very smoothly, and we were given a brief overview of the city and a map of great restaurants. The apartment itself is very stylish and has outdoor space if you want to sit outside. Would definitely stay here again!"
30146528,548196169,2019-10-17,9370740,Sarah,"Wir haben den Aufenthalt in Versaweiss' Wohnung  sehr genossen. Die Lage ist super. Man ist direkt mittendrin und trotzdem ist die Wohnung leise und sehr angenehm. Lediglich in einem Zimmer störten die Geräusche einer Klimaanlage etwas, aber es war alles in allem sehr ruhig. Die Wohnung ist sehr schön eingerichtet und mit vielen liebevollen Details ausgestattet. Unserer Tochter haben am besten die zahlreichen Gesellschaftsspiele gefallen, die sie in der Wohnung gefunden hatte. auch die Kommunikation hat super geklappt. Wir sind nett empfangen worden und es gab eine kleine Einführung über das Viertel anhand eines Umgebungsplans mit verschiedenen Tipps. Wir können die Wohnung auf jeden Fall empfehlen."
30146528,554308894,2019-10-26,30459869,Ain,"Hostess met us and gave us a brief introduction of the apartment, including restaurants we should try out. It was 3 mins away from Monastiraki Square and metro and everything was just a walk away. We had fun hiking up to Acropolis from our apartment and there were plenty of souvenir shops nearby. Plenty of restaurants as well. It was quite tiring to walk up the stairs to the apartment but it was worth it. There was a spillage when we checked in but aside from that, they have been extremely accommodating and helpful!"

Everything you need as around the corner and the location is perfect to explore Athens. Also there are many paid parking lots close by, where we parked our car for the days we stayed. In the evening there were musicians who played in a tavern around the corner and it was nice sitting on the balcony and listening to them. We enjoyed our stay at The apartment very much and would definitely recommend it!"

In a highly pedestrian area, next to restaurants, desert shops and bars and we walked to acropolis! The host responded quickly to everything and even helped when we forgot our keys in the room. Very kind host and cool area. Felt like I was a local! Very safe too, we were two women traveling alone. Host also gave us info for a cab service that picked us up from the airport with a name board and took us to the airport and helped with our bags."

30146528,390341572191989880,2021-06-22,181783307,Vicki,"My husband and I began and ended our month long trip to Greece at Versaweiss's wonderful flat in the Monastiraki neighborhood - and after visiting Crete and the islands, returning to the flat felt a bit like coming home. Would most definitely rent his place again if we ever have the good fortune of going to Athens again."
30146528,392485557720154213,2021-06-25,3073728,Julia,A superb Accommodations in the heart of Athens most vibrant District.
30146528,393912995795948496,2021-06-27,480400,Alex And Sarah,"Fantastic location, stylishly decorated, and affordable. You're in the heart of a rapidly growing, super cute area of Athens, just a few minutes walk from a ton of great cafes/restaurants/bars and of course at the foot of the archaelogical park. Apartment was clean, well-equipped, and communication with host was rapid.<br/><br/>Couple of notes:<br/>-being in the centre of things means that it can get a bit noisy at night with some bar noise heard from the front bedroom. It finished up around 1am (Fri/Sat), but if you're a light sleeper, pack earplugs.<br/>-If you're travelling with babies/kids - a cot was provided and there is a lift for the pram. But no high chair - just something to keep in mind if you're planning on eating a lot at home.<br/>-While there is a lift, there are a few steps up to it before you can get in. Easy enough to do with a stroller however."
30146528,395355204960950123,2021-06-29,407551526,William,This is an amazing area of Athens.  The apartment is in a unique location and makes you feel like a local. The host was very kind and accommodating.  I highly recommend.

Nice  balcony for morning coffee. (There is actually a second balcony, but it is enclosed so we never used it.) Place is pleasant and comfortable, though nothing special from other Airbnbs we’ve used. Hosts were very communicative."
30146528,401213653864073868,2021-07-07,40134568,Thomas,This apartment was spectacularly located in a neighborhood filled with amazing cafes and tavernas for the most sophisticated traveler. The flat itself was clean and well-appointed. Everything I needed for a one night stay. Communication was perfect and check in and checkout was flawless. I will definitely recommend both the host and the flat and will visit again soon! Perfect stay! Thank you for all your help and being so kind as well.
30146528,403293375778943523,2021-07-10,1511697,Jenny,"Pros: location very walkable, which is ideal. 2 bedrooms means private space for guests. Cozy decor. Good for 1 night before heading off to the airport the next morning.<br/><br/>Cons: live music played next door until 3AM and kept person staying in room with pink stripes awake until then. Hall on the first couple of floors was a little dirty (cats litter box/cigarette smoke)."

30146528,426493381525807036,2021-08-11,23128923,Alicia,Excellent location within walking distance of so many good food and drink spots! The host was very responsive to all questions. We needed to print train tickets last minute and they were able to help guide us to a spot similar to a Kinko’s. Would have been nice to have a full bottle of conditioner (we ran out) as well as some body lotion available. The keys are a bit difficult to maneuver but not impossible and opening the doors can be quite loud. Overall a lovely stay here in Athens!

Beds not comfortable but I’m assuming that is just typical for the country. Hosts were highly communicative. Would stay here again. Minimal but clean and everything you need.

Apartment is located above a restaurant, but no smells, and the ceilings in the apartment are high. The apartment itself is small but cozy. Only complaint is the shower water needs to be heated before getting in, and doesn’t last long."

In the morning we were late for the ferry and in the rush locked ourselves between the apartment and the entrance door. We forgot to take a photo of the ONLY available checkout information inside the apartment.. Thankfully we called a neighbor and he was nice enough to open the entrance door.
30146528,456933907881745358,2021-09-22,100316,Mellie,"The apartment was spacious and had everything we needed.  The location is good and there is air conditioning in each room.  We didn’t stay indoors much, but it had everything for cooking and relaxing.   Make sure you open the shower drains before and after bc it can close by your feet turning it. Overall great stay!"

They had two groups arriving at the same time with a small miscommunication but they resolved it in person and extremely quickly. The unit is very well appointed though we just used it for sleeping for a few nights. Highly recommended!!

It has been recently renovated with good taste and it includes all elements necessary for a pleasant and comfortable stay. The balcony offers an excellent view to the city and the surroundings include restaurants, bars and shops of every kind, even mini markets open on Sunday until late evening. The area may be difficult for parking your car but you can speak with the owner, Eva, who will propose solutions in this respect. Eva will also help to any practical matter relating to your stay and she will advise about shops, bars, monuments, excursions, etc. We recommend the apartment and we thank Eva for our stay there."

30178142,416230957,2019-02-24,4199634,Dimitris,"Brand new studio downtown Athens, just a stone's throw away from from vibrant Monastiraki and Psirri. Excellent transportation from/to the Airport/Port with location in between Omonia and Monastiraki metro hubs. Everything is new and your basic needs will be met fully. Spotless cleaniness is a major plus, but on the other hand there are no cooking facilities. Also, construction and location might be responsible for some disturbance due to inadequate soundproofing. However, sleeping quality is good with good matress, pillows and bed linen. The host, Contantinos, is friendly yet professional with prompt replies and always available for any assistance to make your life easy. Definitely a good choice at a resonable cost."

You can clearly see that everything was recently renovated in nordic style. I loved the big space and the bathroom. <br/>Constantinos replied to every message that I sent in no time, which was very helpful. <br/>Everything is in walking distance: less than 10 minutes and you are in Monastiraki, Plaka, Syntagma... so if you don't want to use public transportation, this is great!<br/>At night the area is a little bit noisy, but you can find earplugs in the apartment. <br/>The only thing I didn't like was that at night and early morning, the area didn't look very friendly/safe (although anything happened) so I always walked back home before sunset. <br/>Good value for money, though :)"

We were impressed by the pictures when selecting this airb&b but fell in love when seeing the apartment and the care these amazing hosts put in. Easily accesible to public transportation it’s not a very touristic neighborhood which makes it 100% better as you interact with the locals (all of which where very welcoming). Where you stay can really affect how good your trip will go, with Julie and Jorgos it can only result in a good and unforgettable time."

Would stay there again for sure.

The apartment is super cute, the Terrasse stunning and the location right next to a tram stop.<br/>It’s not the most spacious apartment but enough for two people.

The space is just slightly outside the ‘super’ tourist area which is nice because your close to grocery stores and more local restaurants and yet the place is next to an excellent metro and bus stop or a 30/45 min walk away from the attractions. The bed was comfy the air conditioning was great and the place was spotless! Highly recommend this space. <br/>Also, Julie was a great host with quick reply’s to help us with anything we needed."

30191029,540369426,2019-10-03,42218942,Peter,"Fantastic experience, place is within a residential area, which made it feel really safe. There was a train strike on the day we were there so ended up walking to the Acropolis and back. Although it was far, it was very manageable and was an awesome experience. The local restaurants we visited were amazing value and we would for sure go back again. <br/><br/>Have no problem recommending Julies place. Fantastic value is a great location and the view is absolutely to die for! Awesome experience overall and one that was only helped by the fact Julie and her niece Anna were great to communicate with. Enjoy Athens! We had heard it wasn’t worth the stop over but for sure wish we had stayed an extra couple of days.<br/><br/>Peter Oates, Vancouver Canada."

It’s quite close to the art of athens via public transport. We were here in the winter and it got a little cold at night possibly due to the floor-to-ceiling windows (but the natural lighting and views were superb), but it was alright as the covers were thick enough and kept us warm throughout the night."

30191029,600597210,2020-02-02,90848501,Michal&Natalia,"Julie's place was astonishing.<br/>Very good location. Check-in and check-out were without the problem. The place is on the roof of a 4-floor building. It has 5* of 5* from us.<br/>The place has one wall only from windows, which gives you an amazing view of Athen. We were there at the end of January so it was quite cold due to one wall only from windows and it has no central heating only heating from the A/C. Also, the road below was quite frequent and due to windows, it was quite hard to fall asleep if you are not a quick fall sleeper.<br/>Only these two things bother us, otherwise, it was spotlessly."

30191029,668333473,2020-09-27,181470014,Stéphanie,Le logement de Julie est très bien situé avec une vue imprenable sur l'acropole. Il est propre et bien équipé mais il est difficile de se garer. Une fois la voiture garée on ne l'utilise plus car tous les transports en commun sont à proximité et Julie nous a renseigné sur les divers transports et les alentours à aller voir. L'appartement et surtout sa terrasse est superbe. Je recommande ce logement.
30191029,669531018,2020-09-30,8537686,Henry,"We stayed at Loft 49 when we arrived in Greece and returned here once again after 4 weeks island hopping to Ikaria and the Dodecanese islands. It was the perfect way to start and finish another unforgettable holiday in Greece.  Julie and Jorgos are superb hosts and the apartment has everything one could wish for with coffee, tea, sugar and condiments for cooking as well as a complimentary bottle or arak. It has possibly the best view of the Acropolis, Lycabettus and the Philopappos Hill that there is in Athens. This time we had two added bonuses. Just as the sun was setting and the sky was gloriously changing through a spectrum of different colours, we saw lightening flashes right over the Acropolis. If that wasn't enough, we were later entertained by a spectacular display of lights. I  read the next day that we had actually witnessed the inauguration ceremony of the Acropolis's new light show that had been designed by  Eleftheria Deko. You can read about it and see it here<br/> (Website hidden by Airbnb) <br/>What better could we have had to finish our holiday. We will be back."

Julie and Yiorgos are so heartwarming people, very welcoming. The terrace was so great that we actually never missed a chance to stay at home. The apartment had everything you need for a comfortable stay, also if you more of eating-at-home type. There is also wonderful choice of places to eat around, as well as supermarkets. And not to mention, that you are just an air-conditioned tram ride away from the sea. Since some people mentioned the noise levels from the street, it indeed can get pretty loud around 6 am, but it never bothered us. Athens is in general pretty loud city, with many motor bikes. To sum up, it was just TOP! Thank you very much for such a wonderful experience, it was indeed the best Airbnb we have been at."

Sie liegt im 5. Stock des Gebäudes, was aber kein Problem darstellt da es einen Aufzug gibt. Das Highlight ist aber die Glasfront und die Dachterrasse. Man hat von dort eine wirklich gute Sicht auf die Akropolis und kann dort super den Tag starten oder ausklinken lassen.<br/>Die U-Bahn erreicht man in 5 Minuten zu Fuß, was wirklich angenehm war.<br/>Im Großen und Ganzen war ich sehr zufrieden und kann diese Wohnung nur weiterempfehlen."

As advertised, both metro and tram are short walks, so you can’t easily get to anywhere in Athens.<br/>Julie was very responsive and nice when we needed some supplies refilled."

The loft is relatively tiny; however the layout is functional and has everything to make your stay comfortable.  The area is safe at all times, and you have plenty of dining options just around the block.  Julie went the extra mile and helped me find the Covid-19 testing location, which was needed for my trip back home to the US.

30192195,422025520,2019-03-10,100067795,Sofia,Communication with host was impossible. We found a towel hanging from the ceiling light and at once we complained and requested to cancel our booking however host refused to refund us. If it wasn't for Airbnb help center we wouldn't have taken our money back 
30192195,407702637753653427,2021-07-16,221803965,Eglantine,Nothing was right with the announcement. Autonomous entrance according to the ad? At the last minute we were asked to make a detour to get the keys from an office. Arrival on the spot rather clean... but a roll of toilet paper for 4 days with 2? A kitchen with only one stove and nothing else? Impossible to cook. The air conditioning does not work properly? One tries to contact the host who obviously does not answer any more! We had only the day before our departure a message to know at what time we leave but no consideration of our problems
30192195,408420424054784655,2021-07-17,82901996,Mario,The worst experience on Airbnb I’ve ever made. Check in two hours delayed. Room half cleaned. No toilet paper. The people in the office where I had to take the keys unfriendly and incompetent. Cheap but not worth the money.

Das roch ganz merkwürdig in der Wohnung, alles ist alt und abgekommen. Die Bettwäsche sahen auch nicht frisch aus. Die Ausstattung ist mega alt. Die WLAN Daten, die mir zur Verfügung gestellt wurden, waren auch verkehrt (WLAN Name nicht auffinbar). Nach max. 30 Minuten habe ich das Apartment verlassen und habe dort nicht übernachtet, da es eine Zumutung wäre. Finger weg von!"
30192195,470788921302632823,2021-10-11,423672013,Gornoava,The place is clean and the best thing is that is in Center Athens only 2 min walking to tram Station which brings you to the sea in only 30 min. the only bad thing is the wifi is very slow and it doesn't work properly. but per total a good location.
30193899,357896717,2018-12-12,28417933,Ayelet,"We came to Athens for a very short stay in order to eat well and have fun. We had brilliant communication with Andreas, since it was the first cold of the season. He immediately took care and brought extra heaters and cattle. It is an Excellent location for enjoying this cool neighborhood and very comfortable to reach other central parts of Athens by foot! Perfect flat! We will definitely return here!"

30193899,389607645809794876,2021-06-21,78631955,Μαρία,"Η επικοινωνία μας με τον Ανδρέα ήταν πολύ καλή. Παρά το ότι η κράτηση μας έγινε τελευταία στιγμή και φτάσαμε αργά (11 το βράδυ) στο κατάλυμα ήταν παραπάνω από πρόθυμος να μας βολέψει.  Το δωμάτιο ήταν σχετικά καθαρό με ωραίους χώρους. Δεν είχε μπαλκόνι και τα παράθυρα (δεν είχε σιτες) λόγω Σοφιτας είναι κάπως ψηλά με αποτέλεσμα να μην βλέπεις έξω απο κάπου. Βέβαια, ήταν πρόθυμοι να μας δώσουν ένα άλλο δωμάτιο που είχε μπαλκόνι όμως δεν είχε 2 υπνοδωμάτια και δε χωρούσαμε. Επειδή είχαμε και σκυλάκι ήταν πολύ φιλόξενοι. Το WiFi δεν έπιανε καθόλου. Και η τηλεόραση ήταν ρυθμισμένη σε μια ξένη γλώσσα και δε μπορούσαμε ούτε να την αλλάξουμε ουτε και να λειτουργησουμε την τηλεόραση.  Ειχε ένα κλιματιστικό στο σαλόνι και δυο ανεμιστηρες που ομως ο ενας λειτουργούσε. Οι σκάλες για να ανέβεις στην Σοφίτα σε κάποιο σημείο γίνεται ιδιαιτέρως στενές και απότομες. Ως προς την τοποθεσια αν και λέει ψυρρη είναι στην άκρη της περιοχής. Με τα ποδια είσαι πολύ γρήγορα στο κέντρο της Αθήνας, όμως η περιοχή που είναι το διαμέρισμα είναι κάπως έρημη, με αρκετα επικίνδυνο κόσμο στις γύρω περιοχές. Σε βαθμό που συναντάς ανθρώπους να κάνουν χρήση ναρκωτικών πολύ κοντά στο διαμέρισμα. Δε θα πρότεινα το συγκεκριμένο διαμέρισμα για οικογένειες με μικρά παιδιά ή γυναίκες μόνες."

A very recent renovation, very tasteful decoration, very functional kitchen with everything you might need (I spent a whole month here). The very positive quality of this flat is that it is very very quiet, which in Kolonaki is a great advantage. There are two small balconies that face the internal courtyard. The position is great, it is in the heart of Athens with walking distance to many sites and places. The neighbourhood is lively, elegant, with bars, restaurants and shops nearby. Excellent communication with the whole team of Upstreet. I highly recommend it if you want to stay in a quiet, safe and central environment!"

30194972,524561091,2019-09-06,17936260,Daniel,"Upstreet (the managing company) is by far the most professional airbnb I have ever dealt with, they have a great structure with the guest, a bunch of information on the airbnb, great communication. The place was what you see in pictures, a bit smaller from the interpretations of pictures. They were very kind to me during my stay and accommodate my difficult travel. It’s on the 5th floor and expect the elevator to be small. None of this would make your experience different if you expect it. In summary, I would stay with upstreet and in this apartment again only if the location were different. Yes, its close to coffee shops and “chic” stores but I would not call the neighborhood upscale, it also tends to be further away from the main areas where you most likely will be walking. I read a number of post about neighborhoods and some recommend Kolonaki, but I would not recommended (especially if you have a short trip). Sure its relative close, but the (Small) slope + 12 min of walking will get old quickly and it was mostly run-down with a chic-store here and there, so nothing to see or even cultural about it. In conclusion, I really want to stress how great the service is and I plan to use upstreet again, just probably in not-Kolonaki. At least that’s not my preferred location and not my expectation, and of course this is my opinion which I believe diverges from all the other 100s of opinions about the location being good, so take that with a grain of salt."

Μετά από emails, τηλεφωνήματα και συνεννοήσεις και προφανώς μεγάλη αναστάτωση σε μένα, τελικά το θέμα διευθετήθηκε, γιατί η ομάδα της upstreet φρόντισε να ερευνήσει λίγο παραπάνω το ζήτημα και να διαποιστώσει ότι τα σημάδια προυπήρχαν.

We had enjoyed the good view of the acropolis from our bedroom. Travellers can find many restaurants in the surrounding that offer various kinds of food. It is also a good place for souvenir hunters where most shops are opened from 10.00 am to 10.00 pm. Some shops are opened until mid-night. The apartment itself is very well kept with nice furnitures and decorations. The host was very responsive to our queries while settling in. Overall it was a good choice.

The air b n b was lovely and SUCH such an amazing location, could not have been better. the host’s list of local places to eat and drink was incredibly helpful (unfortunately some of them were closed due to the August holiday) and it made Athens feel a lot more manageable! Thank you for having us and for all your help!!"

Great location, beautiful view, comfortable and open apartment, very clean, bed and couches were very comfortable, AC was great in August heat, nice bathroom and shower, everything was very clean. Communication was excellent and the personal recommendations put this stay over the top. I've stayed at several Airbnbs and this experience was by far the most professional, in a good way."

Allez y !!!!"

30195411,523191935,2019-09-03,85600311,Darwin,"Highly recommendable!!! Dimitris apartment was the Perfect Choice for our short trip. The apartment has a lot of space, was really clean and bright. The view of the acropolis from the balcony was just perfect. <br/>The area around the apartment is amazing. You can reach all the nice areas and the sights (Agora, acropolis, ...) by foot. We’re really looking forward to our next stay at Athens and Dimitris apartment!!"

30195411,533745557,2019-09-22,73264066,Greg,"This was our third stay at Dimitris’ apartment once again we found it clean, quiet, comfortable and most of all we like the location it’s in. Thank you Dimitri we will be back the next time we’re in Athens."
30195411,535362084,2019-09-24,9559938,Joan,"Wow.  The view from the bedroom is exactly as shown in the photos.  There is a lift to get you and your luggage upstairs.  It is in walking distance to much of what you want to see in Athens and the nearest metro station 4 minute walk (where the green and blue lines interchange) have direct lines to the Ferry/Cruise ship Port (green) and the airport (blue).  As we arrived by Ferry and left by air this was incredibly convenient.  The kitchen is well equipped (one of the few places we stayed in Greece with a microwave as well.  Although the apartment is near busy eateries and nightlife, once the windows/doors to balconies are closed it is amazingly quiet inside.  The quiet aircons in the very spacious lounge and bedroom make for extra comfort.  Bed very comfy.  The desk to sit and work is spacious.  Wi-Fi is good.  All in all a marvellous apartment and one I will return to the next time I am in Athens."
30195411,537139416,2019-09-28,221854811,Mike,Great location and very good hosts.  Highly recommended if you are going to spend time seeing ATHENS and all it’s wonders!
30195411,538724214,2019-09-30,1587692,Jessica,The apartment is located in the heart of Athens - walking distance to the Acropolis. It is also surrounded by many bars and restaurants. The apartment itself is very comfortable and clean. Flexible checkout time for a small additional fee was a convenient bonus!
30195411,544025421,2019-10-09,262417709,Chris,"很不错的房子,超级大,很明亮,位置超级便利,周边全是吃的｡房东的接送机服务也炒鸡Nice.很不错的体验"

30195411,577165870,2019-12-15,242518185,Jeanette,"The apartment is in a great location, perfect for visiting attractions or the stalls in Plaka.<br/><br/>The space is beautiful with everything we needed for our few days in Athens.<br/><br/>Communication with Homer and Isabella was very good and they gave us some great suggestions on places to eat."
30195411,580699687,2019-12-23,311307479,Janet,"It was a great stay. The location is absolutely amazing. The apartment is immaculate. There was a bit of loudness due to construction nearby, the bed was amazing but the choice of pillows was actually a bit poor. The amenities in the apartment and around were amazing, a LOT of great food and things to see very close by."
30195411,583698688,2019-12-29,37333637,Matthias,"Overall a very good value.  Didn't actually meet with owner(s), but communication was good both before and during stay. Nice, clean apartment with spacious livingroom in a very fun and lively neighborhood.  Close to all the things we wanted to see. The downside of that is that it is very noisy at night, especially for someone sleeping on couch in livingroom (bedroom is quieter)."
30195411,587465633,2020-01-03,21862941,Harriet,A view to die for and great hosts.

30195411,603464166,2020-02-09,315535655,Konstantinos,"Εξαιρετικό σπίτι, πάρα πολύ ευρύχωρο, όμορφο, καθαρό, ήρεμο και ακριβώς δίπλα στο μετρό. Είναι πλήρως εξοπλισμένο και οι ιδιοκτήτες είναι πολύ εξυπηρετικοί. Το προτείνω ανεπιφύλακτα!!"
30195411,614747279,2020-03-06,338609987,Rose,The location was absolutely perfect for everything in the center. The Acropolis is only two metro stops away and the view from the bedroom was beautiful!
30195411,617170995,2020-03-12,15072697,Donal,Dimitris is a great host. Lots of useful information about check in and then local places to eat and drink once you arrive. Dimitris was very prompt responding to queries. The apartment is very spacious and exceptionally clean. It's a good location for places to eat/drink and places to visit. Most places in central Athens are within 20/30 min walk so I never used public transport in the 3 days I was there. Surprisingly quiet streets (though I was there at the Virus was starting to have an impact and probably less people about) and lovely village-like neighbourhoods . I thought Athens was an extraordinary place to visit and this was a great place to be based.
30195411,640412688,2020-07-20,95525921,Aimilios,Great location and beautiful appartment!<br/>Highly recommended!<br/>Thank you
30195411,641024227,2020-07-22,110923663,Oskar,"Dimitriss was amazing! Responsiveness was unseen, would reply within seconds/minutes. The local tips were on point, loved all the recommendations. The location and apartment itself were perfect and high value for the price. Thank you once more to these hospitable people."
30195411,643841869,2020-07-29,9725806,Brenda K.W.,"As described, lovely and spacious apartment with lots of natural light in a great and very safe area. Hosts were very responsive and all went very smoothly and pleasantly!"

30195411,651808591,2020-08-16,354870084,Julie,"The place is nicely decorated and very spacious. The view of the acropolis is spectacular, exactly like the picture. The location is great. Monastiraki has more of a local feel to it compared to Plaka, which is way more touristy. Easy walking distance to many of the landmarks too. <br/>What I didn't like was that I had to wait for about 20 minutes for hot water after turning on a switch, and had to remember to turn the switch off after. After walking through the ruins all day, I just want to take a shower and go to sleep! Also, the host's response was slow and the hospitality was not ideal."
30195411,656279524,2020-08-25,299301343,Ikra,"Die Aussicht aus dem Schlafzimmer war atemberaubend. Außerdem war die Lage der Wohnung perfekt, total zentral aber gleichzeitig in einer etwas ruhigeren Seitenstraße. Auch die Anreise mit der Metro vom Flughafen war angenehm. Die Dusche war leider sehr alt und eng, man konnte sich kaum bewegen. Außerdem war die Klima im Schlafzimmer nicht ausreichend, wir vermuten sie ist Defekt, da sie kaum gekühlt hat. Dafür hat die Klima im Wohnzimmer aber sehr gut funktioniert, weshalb wir auch zwangsweise auf dem<br/>Sofa geschlafen haben."

30195411,669280211,2020-09-29,833313,Andrea,I loved being at Dimitris place. The place is stylish and very well located. Dimitris was extremely responsive to all my requests. <br/><br/>The only negative note has been bedroom blinders. They are short and you cannot make the room dark which is pretty annoying if you want to sleep in during weekends
30195411,669808620,2020-10-01,255732518,Mattias,An amazing flat with a gorgeaus view of the Acropolis!

30195411,400413414749242243,2021-07-06,136965219,Kenneth,"This was a top tier stay . The Apartment is tucked right in the heart of the bustling old city . Countless food options in walking distance , with a glimpse of the Acropolis right out the window. The living space is spacious, with more than enough room for two . The hosts were awesome , Homer and Isabella were very accommodating with coordinating transportation when we required it , and were always prompt to respond . If you are looking for a spot in the heart of Athens with all the sites in walking distance, look no further."
30195411,402561674506604096,2021-07-09,30738681,Pamela,"Staying at Dimitris' apartment was excellent! The place is very nicely designed, clean, and it has everything you might need for your stay. It's also very close to the Acropolis, and the air conditioner was a big plus since we got very hot temperatures during our stay. Dimitris even went the extra mile and shared a very thorough list of places to visit. I highly recommend staying here, and I'll definitely be back when I return to Athens."

30195411,430838095306325269,2021-08-17,155023315,Erin,"Great location and lots of space. You can see acropolis from room but not from bed, just when standing by window, still beautiful. You are a 4 minute walk to the metro which gets you literally everywhere! We loved our time here. The best part was probably the hosts as they were extremely responsive and quick to help with absolutely anything we needed."

Host gave excellent recommendations for all areas of Athens. Would recommend this place and Psyri as a whole to anyone wanting to visit Athens.
30195411,469239860199990043,2021-10-09,40133513,Kai,"Apartment ist sehr zentral gelegen und bestens geeignet für Leute die feiern wollen, aber vor 2 Uhr Nachts kann man nicht schlafen, da es von der Straße und den Bars ringsum sehr laut ist. Also Nichts für Leute, die es ruhiger mögen.<br/><br/>Die Dusche läuft nicht ab und für warmes Wasser muss man 20 min vorher den Boiler erhitzen. WLAN PW ist nicht wie in der Anzeige beschrieben, sondern for Standardeinstellung, die auf dem Router steht.<br/><br/>Appartement ist ordentlich, aber bei Weitem nicht das, was wir uns erwartet haben."
30195411,470723754975730717,2021-10-11,63886521,Rafael,"El alojamiento está bien en cuanto espacio. Aparte de dormir en la cama principal el resto no es muy cómodo si son más de dos persomas. La llegada puede ser problemática porque hay 4 contenedores automáticos de llaves y no indican claramente cual es el que tienes que utilizar. La visión de la Acrópolis es totalmente parcial y absolutamente no desde la cama. Suele haber bastante ajetreo en la calkle llena de pubs. Y observar atentamente las indicaciones sobre utilización de servicios, sobre todo el agua caliente."

We loved Atitamos restaurant that host recommend to us. Also gyros place next to omonia metro station was cheap and delicious. Special thanks to host for organising our airport transferts, it was so practical and worked very well! We had perfect stay in Athens and recommand this place to others too !"

Toni and his staff were just outstanding with their service and hospitality and again the apartment was just so well presented,  modern,  great location and the beds are the most comfortable we have slept throughout our travels across Europe. If you ever need accommodation in Athens I would highly recommend Toni's apartments as it is way more than just a place to stay.  Thanks again Toni and hope we cross paths again."

Die Dusche funktionierte mit super Wasserdruck (selten in Athen erlebt). Es war eine Wohltat nach dem langen Fußmarsch durch Athen in diese ruhige <br/>, saubere Wohnung zu kommen. Check in war ohne Probleme und Toni beantwortete jede Frage schnell und mit vielen guten Ratschlägen. Die Lage ist optimal, direkt neben dem archäologischen Museum und es gibt genügend Verkehrsverbindungen zum Zentrum. Wir würden diese Wohnung sofort wiederbuchen, wenn es uns nach Athen verschlägt. Wie waren absolut zufrieden. DAnke für den schönen Aufenthalt"
30216160,500366387,2019-08-02,12851895,Brianna,Toni’s place was great in every way. The location was great for seeing all the ancient ruins. A quick walk to the subway and you can be anywhere very quickly. The apartment was spotless. The kitchen had all amenities we needed and more. The a/c units were great in both bedrooms and the screens on the windows were great for sleeping in. The coffee shop at the ground floor of the building was awesome. The grocery store was within a few minutes walk and had everything we needed. Lots of great restaurants nearby. I highly recommend the airport transfer Toni arranged. It was so smooth and our driver was so helpful. The host who checked us in was very thorough and marked areas of interest on a map for us to go see. The experience was one of the best we have had so far.

Une fois les fenêtres fermées, on n'entend plus du tout le bruit de la ville. Les personnes auxquelles nous avons eu affaire étaient très souriantes et très professionnelles. Nous avons pu déposer nos bagages plus tôt dans les bureaux de l'agence. Le seul point faible de cet appartement est sa situation géographique. Il est situé dans un quartier où l'on ne se sent pas en sécurité. C'est bien dommage."

El barrio está muy cerca del centro pero no demasiado recomendable, sobre todo al caer la noche (cerca de 2 locales de alterne y zona de vagabundos, drogas,...) Aún así, con cuidado es un barrio muy cercano al centro y siempre hay alguien en la puerta de los apartamentos vigilando. Ideal con cuidado."

Lovely, brand new apartment in a walking distance from the major attractions, sight seeing and public transportation,  as well as equipped with all the amenities that makes me opt for air bnb instead of a hotel room. The area is nice with a strong local flavour and nevertheless 25 minutes walk or 10 minutes ride away from Parthenon and the touristic area with a lot of things always going on, which Romanos and his team informed me in advance so I can choose and once more  have the info to live like a local in Athens. Very nice value for money cafes, taverns and restaurants for every budget and taste and yet the flat situated in a quiet street. I will definitely come back in this flat. Thanks!"

It is also well located, in a popular and quite alive street, part of the greec way of life !<br/>One small thing to mention, the main bed matress was a bit thin to our likeness, we could feel the underneath metal structure. But we tried the couch bed and that was just fine.<br/>Romanos showed flexibility, and kindly accepted to extend our stay so we could keep our stuffs in the place until 14h00, which was very nice of him. Thanks <br/>We would definitly go back to Romanos appartment in a future stay in Athenes. <br/>Thanks again."

30222830,669312203,2020-09-29,3480082,Timothy,"Large space in a very alternative neighbourhood. It was perfect for me as I’d stayed central on a previous visit to Athens and enjoyed staying in a different neighbourhood for a change. The apartment is also around the corner for regional buses that go to all the beaches south of Athens (dubbed the Athens riviera), which was a huge bonus. I walked into city centre from apartment but after doing that once or twice it’s kind of far, if you’ve been exploring all day might want to take bus or cab, which is worth considering. <br/>Nancy who dealt with check in etc was so helpful and gave me specific detailed advice tailored to what I wanted to see and do while I was there. Her information was invaluable and a highlight to staying in the apartment. <br/>The main road is nearby, an arterial road in and out of the city and traffic noise can be heard inside the apartment if you have the windows open. The space is also quite dark, not much natural light, but the space served the purpose for a few days visit, spending most of the day out and about."
30222830,702938179,2020-10-23,8836704,Simon,I highly recommend this apartment It’s very spacious and has everything you need.

The apartment is situated at the edge of exarchia.

I'd recommend this place to my friends.

It’s only a 30 minute walk to Syntagma (centre of Athens). The walk takes you via the Modern Olympic Stadium and the Botanic Gardens, which are beautiful.<br/><br/>The nearest metro is an easy 10 minute easy walk away. Buses are at hand within a couple of minutes, as are food shops, café’s and any type of shop you need. Convenience plus!<br/><br/>Sofia maintains the warm, cosy apartment to a high standard. The balcony views over a traditional Greek garden. It was lovely seeing the trees fruiting and waking up listening to the birds.<br/><br/>On the kitchen table Sofia had left maps of inner Athens and the metro. I was grateful to have these. In general Sofia was extremely helpful, even before I arrived at the apartment. She was always available and went out of her way to assist me if needed. <br/><br/>Once again…great apartment and fantastic hostess. Thanks Sofia!"

Everything was perfectly clean, nice decoration, quiet neighbourhood, an extremely central and practical location and the hosts were super helpful. The only negative point is that when we came, the weather was very cold and rainy and unfortunately, the apartment cools down very rapidly, so you have to put on the heat like crazy - but in summer, this might be an advantage.

The check in was easy and the apartment was very clean and in a great location very close to the metro and a lot of shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay there again if we go back to Athens.
30232545,505284018,2019-08-09,133039343,Tong,"This place was okay for our last day in Athens. It’s kind of in a weird location. Somewhat sketchy but safe at the same time. The AC worked well. The living room and bedroom were a little empty and the pillows were not comfortable at all. The photos made the place look newer than it is. The hosts were nice, however. Thanks for being responsive."
30232545,512268466,2019-08-18,259732291,Laurynas,"Perfect place. With all necessities.  And 2 min away from metro line, that enables you to reach city centre in literaly 15min."
30232545,514363247,2019-08-21,98474879,Mageda,Its a great place we had for a very good price. A small simple apartement  with great minimalistic design . You still have a lot of room to move. I especially loved the way the small kitchen was desgined to still give enough room for <br/>a dining table and  comfort while cooking.<br/><br/>I did not expect coffee and supplies for the washing mashine  so that was great.<br/><br/>Even the area is very beautiful and relaxing ( the building is in a small beautiful street which leads to a open place with Restaurants and metro ) <br/><br/>The contact via chat was always avaible  check in was easy and we had a lot of privacy :)<br/><br/>The Air conditioner and wifi  is  great!<br/><br/>Wish we booked more days there!

30232545,519670485,2019-08-29,284794220,Emma,"Le logement était bien. Propre et spacieux. La boite à clés est très pratique car nous pouvons arriver et repartir à n'importe quel moment de la journée. En revanche, seul reproche, l'appartement n'est pas forcément très bien placé: il est proche des quartiers touristiques mais le quartier de Victoria n'est pas très rassurant. À Athènes, dès que l'on sort des quartiers touristiques et antiques, nous pouvons vite nous retrouver dans des quartiers sales, et où l'on ne sait pas trop sur qui nous pouvons tomber. Comme nous étions deux filles, nous avons tout fait en taxi. Sinon l'échange avec Alexandra était très bien."

30232733,352300138,2018-11-25,224038851,Lefteris,"Πολύ ευχάριστη εμπειρία η διαμονή μου στο 7 steps apartment. Ο Λευτέρης με υποδέχτηκε εγκάρδια και ήταν πολύ φιλόξενος . Το σπίτι ήταν άριστο και αντάξιο των προσδοκιών μου . Είχε ότι χρειαζόμουν και νόστιμο πρωινό . Το κρεβάτι ήταν άνετο και ο χώρος ζεστός και πολύ καθαρός . Ήταν διαθέσιμος όποτε τον χρειάστηκα . Επίσης προτείνω ανεπιφύλακτα το μαγαζί που βρίσκεται από κάτω , την αμβροσια . Θα χάσετε αν δε δοκιμάσετε τα παϊδακια και το κεμπάπ . Λευτέρη σε ευχαριστώ για η φιλοξενία σίγουρα θα επιστρέψω"
30232733,354744101,2018-12-02,67546382,Vali,"Although Lefteris is new on Airbnb, he should already offer lessons to many hosts about what an amazing acommodation experience means.<br/>Words are not enough to describe the experience we had at Lefteris' apartment. In fact, a single word could describe it: perfect. What could one want from an acommodation in Athens? A good position - checked! The location is at a 5-10 minutes walk from Plaka and Acropole. Close to a public transportation station - checked! The metro station is right at the entrance of the building. Markets, shops and restaurants in the area - checked! There is a restaurant right under the apartment, there are other places to eat too really close, shops with clothes, supermarkets - everything you need.<br/>If you are coming with the family(as we did), you'd probably want 2 bedrooms and a living room - checked! If you come in Athens by car, you need to know that parking is kind of a big issue in Athens and it is very expensive but Lefteris helped us even with this: he found us a parking, really close, guarded 24/7 at a great price!<br/>About the experience from the apartment, what can I say, we had everything that one could want. The towels were soft, new and clean, like the ones from a 4/5 stars hotel, the kitchen was fully equipped (and I REALLY mean fully!) not only with a microwave, oven, and all the basics, but also a sandwitch maker, coffee filter, coffee, cereals, and a lot of other things. And, for the shock of the incredible apartment to be complete: in the fridge some soda, beer and water were waiting for us. We felt like kings. What is more, he had a lot of little things that we have not seen at other hosts(like a huge roll of napkins).<br/>Due to the fact that we came in the winter, we were a little scared that we would be cold after other less pleasant experiences during the trip. Lefteris told us through text that the apartment is warm but we didn't believe until we arrived. Moreover, there were functioning air conditioning devices to provide heat in both of the bedrooms and in the living room.<br/>Problems can appear any time - the real issue is how quick they are solved. Lefteris answered our texts instantly and managed to solve everything, appearing like a genie from a magical lamp everytime we needed something (eg: my daughter wanted more heat, since she had a cold, and our kind host came to the property super fast with an electrical heater).<br/>Concluding, if you are lucky enough to book this apartment, you will definitely feel like at home, having everything one could need."
30232733,356408153,2018-12-08,226296946,Svetlana,"The apartment is in a great location, few steps outside the Sygrou-Fix metro station, which is one station away from the Acropolis. If one wants to go by foot, the Acropolis is 10 minutes away from the apartment, while Syntagma Square is 20 minutes away by foot.  There are restaurants and other shops within the area. The location is very convenient.<br/><br/>The apartment was newly renovated with new appliances and furniture. The kitchen was stocked with coffee, tea and cereals for breakfast. New and fresh linens & towels were provided.<br/><br/>The host, Lefteris, was very accommodating. We arrived at the apartment at an early hour and he let us checked-in. He also provided us with welcome drinks. He immediately responds to our queries.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a wonderful stay for us and we recommend this place for those who will be staying in Athens."

The host’s restaurant was our favorite in Athens (get the grilled feta)! The home had everything and more than expected, like q-tips and a nice iron. Lefteris was a great host and responded very quickly to any questions. Overall, our expectations were exceeded and we would definitely stay here again if we return to Athens!"

Groceries stores 3 min walk from the apartment, a lot of places to eat in the area from ice cream, bakery to local restaurants with authentic greek food. If you need to print out your air tickets/boarding passes go to Foto Victor: 36 Veikou Lamprou Street, Koukaki, 117 42 Athens Attica Greece.<br/>Foto Victor is a 3 min walk from the apartment right in front of a great bakery with breakfast, smoothies and delicious desserts.

A few minutes to go away from the Acropolis, Bars, Restaurants and the downtown. We had a very nice trip in Athens and would come at every time back to Lefteris Apartment ! :-)"

30232733,430230848,2019-03-30,9186621,Penny,"Look no further! This apartment is cosy but at this price, you cannot say no! Lefteris is extremely hospitable and accommodating. He waited for our late arrrival - 1.15am! I highly recommend this apartment not only because of the location, cleanliness, price and accommodating Lefteris. But an extra plus is the food his family restaurant serves! Ambrosia is the restaurant name. Nothing fancy but hearty good traditional Greek food.  Give the restaurant a go and do not hesitate to stay here too."
30232733,431906241,2019-04-02,2529298,Cheryl,GREAT place. Amazingly convenient- at the Metro and easy walk to Acropolis - lift in the building- spacious clean and very comfortable. The square where 7 steps is situated has everything you need including ambrosia cafe downstairs for authentic delicious Greek food- close by for pastry ice cream a raw food cafe and burgers- supermarkets very close- an amazing rooftop bar with VIEWS around the corner- I could not have been happier with this apartment.

Otherwise, we may ruin the schedule terribly.<br/>The house we stayed in Greece’s first night is so lovely and memorable. <br/>We’re honored to share our wonderful experience to those people who might be the next lucky guys."

This location is a very close walk to the Acropolis and Plaka neighborhood area and is also conveniently right outside a metro stop.

Do ladinho do metrô, com várias opções de farmácia, café, restaurantes (inclusive no da família de Lefteris, que tem um excelente custo benefício e a comida é deliciosa) e mercado. Toda a vizinhança é bem simpatica e plana (viajamos com duas senhoras idosas e isso foi bem importante). Super recomendo."

Nous avons constaté qu’un volet de la chambre ne fonctionnait pas ainsi que la climatisation de cette même chambre, le volet a été réparé dès le lendemain malheureusement pas la climatisation, nous aurions aimé avoir des nouvelles mais plus d information.<br/>Concernant l’appartement, très bon emplacement, l Acropole a pied ainsi que la plupart des lieux à visiter. Appartement spacieux."

30232733,502024632,2019-08-04,30491584,Deniz,"This is a very convenient spot, well worth the money. Easy transportation all times of the day. The restaurant downstairs is related to the host, so in case of any issues they are right downstairs, pretty much available all day. (It's also a super delicious place to get late night snacks). Overall was a very pleasant experience for us, despite some issues with AC, which were resolved quickly."
30232733,507015020,2019-08-11,143014405,Mehreen,"It was a nice place to stay, close to many historical sites, subways , buses and hop on hop off services."
30232733,518086650,2019-08-26,6926879,Juan,"Very good apartment in a very good location.<br/>Communication with owner was perfect and quick.<br/>Check in is easy because the restaurant downstairs is a property of the owner too.<br/>Apartment is very comfortable and 1km away from main spots of the city, easy to get there by walking.<br/>WIFI was a little slow, maybe because is shared with the restaurant? in any case, could be better, it went up and down several times during our stay (4 nights).<br/>Also, A/C wasn´t working in the 2 bedrooms (only living room was ok). Lefteris was very responsive and he got a solution the 3rd night.. so at the end we spent 2 of 4 nights without A/C (August, 35°C.. ). I think the owner should check everything is working before a new guest arrive.<br/>Tip : according to the person that got the A/C working again, the failure was because the system in the apartment to get electricity is similar to hotels, you put a card by the door. So if you leave the apartment and get the card off while the AC is on, this may cause the failure.. always put off the AC before leaving the apartment!<br/>Thanks"
30232733,524078584,2019-09-05,246512569,Kate And James,Very helpful host. Cute apartment only a short walk to the Acropolis. Great value for money
30232733,527092005,2019-09-10,286774084,Paul,"Truly several steps from everything. We booked here based on location. We walked to all the major sights. Ate at a bunch of nice restaurants in between. What we couldn’t walk to, we took the Metro. Simple. Easy. Oh, and the coffee in the apartment was excellent! Stay here."

30232733,528394419,2019-09-13,58660070,Shihoko,"The Good: Incredibly convenient location. The apartment is right next to a station, and is walking distance from lots of tourists sights such as museums and the Acropolis.  It's hard to beat that. In addition, his family's restaurant is on the floor right below the same apartment complex, so it was easy to find and their food was cheap and absolutely delicous! <br/><br/>The so-so: It was nice of him that he tried to fix the toilet cover and the tap on the kitchen after we got there, but it would ne nicer if he could have done it before we checked-in. We arrived to Athens early in the morning and were looking forward to napping before we went exploring. Instead the host left a repairman in our place to finish doing that and left to do his own thing. So we ended up being the ones babysitting the repairman on our own vacation. We recognize sometimes these things happen, it was just off-putting. Additionally, the basic amenities were provided and the place was clean. Not the most comfy of beds or pillows, but does get the job done.<br/><br/>The bad: Communication leading up to the check-in was simple put...terrible. This was our first time in Greece, so we chose this host specifically for the rave reviews about the host being pleasant and helpful. However, we instead were ignored on the days leading up to the check-in and even the day of checking in. We got stuck in limbo unsure if we could drop our bags off early or not, and didn't know the best way to get to the area. Very simple questions, which most hosts usually have no issues providing answers to.<br/><br/>Overall, the stay was just okay. Actually checking in was a mess, and the first couple hours after were a bit of a headache, but after we settled in it was nice enough."
30232733,529744432,2019-09-15,61224106,Lizzy,"Lovely spacious apartment, right in the centre of Athens. Great host and would highly recommend to all types of travellers. Thank you for letting us stay Lefteris!"

Lefteris was extremely accommodating and very responsive which was much appreciated because of the time restraints! The place was very clean, beds were comfortable, and Lefteris was there to greet us himself and give us some tips of the area. Very great location near restaurants, a market, and all the major tourist attractions. Would definitely recommend!"

It’s located in a great spot, close to the Acropolis, and just steps from a metro entrance. It’s just upstairs from a busy restaurant area so it is fairly noisy-made it harder to sleep, but if noise doesn’t bother you, you’ll be fine. Lefteris was a great host, even allowed us to check in early. Felt like a nice safe area, not too touristy. Would recommend."

It was easily accessible to the Acropolis Museum and the Acropolis itself. Many great shops from the highlight of the most warming/welcoming restaurant in which is his family restaurant that served local food the portions where big enough to feed two (the best Gyros EVER) and the price of the menu for the amount of food was more than exceptional, the hospitality and service was SO kind..! Very nice women’s clothing shop called eight with cute clothes and dresses across the street! There is a fabulous more upscale restaurant called God’s restaurant had the best lamb chops I’ve ever had! Next to God’s restaurant there is a fantastic breakfast restaurant! We are a family of 4 it’s perfect for a family. Kids ages are 12 & 17…! We tried to book for the last part of our vacation but the apartment wasn’t available for the dates this says a lot! <br/>The only disadvantage is the rooms and bathroom are a bit small but very manageable for a nice comfy stay!"

30242387,665271815,2020-09-18,73456150,Alexina Janya,"Attention Dear Potential Guests, please beware. Alexandros has opened a complaint about me inflating the truth and making unreasonable accusations about me to air bnb, in order to charge me for 130e in damages. It feels awful to be unjustifiably accused. <br/><br/>If you choose to stay at this air bnb make sure you take pictures before you leave. I clean air bnbs before I leave, and not to paint myself a saint but I will state how I cleaned further on as he is charging me for cleaning time and probably the damage is the ’Lock I broke on a closet.’ For context,  I’m a 35 year old woman, I’ve stayed in plenty of air bnbs with only good feedback from hosts. I live in Greece. I was working and visiting friends in Athens! Alexandros’ place is a poorly ventilated basement studio and I stayed here for a week, its nicely designed but there is a smell coming from the drains. Here are the accusations from Alexandros and my defence. <br/><br/>Claim 1:  ‘I broke the lock into a cupboard and used everything in it that was for other guests’ : As someone who has never broken into anything, I can only say that the cupboard was not locked at all, perhaps it usually is. But It must have opened easily as I stored my clothes in there and I used extra towels & sheets. It’s hard to get the dirt off ur feet in Athens in the summer and it’s very sweaty. The white sheets that didn’t fit the bed properly got easily dirty.  The closet, I assumed was open, so I assumed I could use these.<br/><br/>Claim 2: ‘Unpleasant smell of cigarettes and the house keeper finding cigarettes’: There was no smoking in the apartment - the apartment is below street level. I would sit just outside the door and smoke using the ashtray they provided. Which I emptied into the trash bag I left behind. The only possible answer is the smell came from the trash bag in the poorly ventilated apartment. Apologies for that part, I should have thought about that and taken the trash out but I did forget. As far as the housekeeper finding a ‘ton of cigarettes’. If she physically went digging around into the trash bag - that’s where she found cigarette butts of course. <br/><br/>Claim 3: Mess inside the fridge:  The fridge had a minimal amount of ice cream that dripped into the fridge, from the top freezer drawer because their freezer didn’t work. That would have only taken minimal cleaning as well.<br/><br/>The apartment was clean enough when I got there, but as I stayed for a week and I like a clean environment, I cleaned as I went. Alongside the accusations of me ‘using all the clean linen/towels’ that weren’t meant for me. I also used their cleaning supplies. I hoovered some areas 3 times while I was there (It’s a bare floor mainly and I hate the feeling of bits and dirt sticking to my feet) I also mopped twice. I also cleaned down every surface (except for the high table) washed my dishes and put them all away. I took my own trash out every day, except the last 2 days when I saw a roll of black bin bags inside the cupboard I allegedly broke into.<br/><br/>Laundry & cleaning are expected as an air bnb host. I left the laundry in a bundle on the floor at the end for cleaning. I got up earlier before check out to make sure the place was in the same state I left it, bar the rubbish bag to take out, and the drip of ice cream that I forgot about. <br/><br/>Having to justify myself and being faced with a reimbursement request has left me feeling shocked and uneasy. It’s unjustified, his statements are highly misleading, and one is just a lie. I honestly thought that the linen was available for use - but apparently it was for other guests, and Alexandros believes I consciously broke a lock to get in to the closet. As evidence to air bnb he sent 3 pictures - 1) a picture of the bundled laundry and said this is the laundry she took. 2) The empty cupboard I ‘broke into and took everything’ 3) The picture of the spill in the fridge.<br/><br/>Phew - if you made it this far thank you for listening and here is the complaint he sent. <br/><br/>‘’Alexina, left the apartment in a very messy situation, which led to additional housekeeping time and additional linen and towels. The guest opened, no clue how, a well locked closet where we keep our supplies, and used everything, including all the clean linen/ towels that are intended to be used for next guests. She broke the lock of the closet. Finally, the housekeeper found a ton of cigarettes and unpleasant smoke smell in the apartment, something that is strictly prohibited and referred also in the rules. ‘’"

30242387,707328627,2020-11-08,6236918,Marianna,"Overall we are quite satisfied with the house; it is in a very convenient location, very close to the centre of Athens but also next to the metro station, from where you can go everywhere. Also, the neighbourhood is very convenient, since you can find literally whatever you want and need (supermarket, coffee places, bar, laundry place and many many more). In addition to that, not only there is a mini-market (periptero) outside of the house, but also the location is perfect for delivery - if you are using a delivery app, you can order whatever you like. <br/>The house itself is exactly what you see in the pictures, nicely decorated and smartly arrangement of the things, given the available space. Not much light though, because it is in the street level. However, this isn't affecting much the noise coming from the street; it is bearable. Last but not least, the communication with the owner was very good, they are answering very fast and they very quite helpful. <br/>However, we have been disappointed by how clean was the house. We felt that it wasn't taken care of well prior to our arrival and there is definitely space for improvement regarding that. The floor wasn't that clean and also some plates and glasses were not well washed. Moreover, even if it was good that a vacuum cleaner was provided, it wasn't in a good condition, and while using it a very bad smell was coming out of it. We also found three cockroaches in the cabinet on top of the absorber and in the shower. If the cleanliness condition was better, it would be a very good choice overall."

I would mention the flat is just below street level with pedestrians passing regularly, which isn't an issue for me, but others may find it somewhat busy."

30242387,746548899,2021-04-07,142195320,Faith,"The location was ideal for me hence why I booked the accommodation. However, I was disappointed with the apartment which is basically one room separated with a room divider between the sitting area and bed. Also the room smelt of cigarette smoke which wasn’t very nice. No bath mat provided nor an ironing board which a needed. I expected more for the price to tell the truth. Also, no hand sanitiser or disinfectant spray which is essential during this period."
30242387,768245415,2021-06-09,77555509,Ioannis,"Αρκετά προσεγμένο διαμέρισμα, καθαρό και σε βολική περιοχή.<br/>Δεν μας άρεσε που είναι υπόγειο και σκοτεινό σε πολυσύχναστο δρόμο. Χρειάζεται να έχεις φακό γιατί τα κλειδιά είναι συνδεδεμένα με την πλαστική κάρτα που τοποθετείται στην άκρη του διαμερίσματος για να ενεργοποιηθεί το ρεύμα και είναι στην άκρη του διαμερίσματος. Επίσης ξυπνάς κάθε μέρα 7 το πρωί λόγω της εκκλησίας ακριβώς απέναντι που χτυπάει τις καμπάνες λες και είναι ανάσταση κάθε μέρα. Το πιστολάκι μαλλιών απουσίαζε από τη θέση του και παρόλο που ενημερώσαμε για 8 ημέρες που μείναμε δεν έγινε κάτι."

L’emplacement du logement est très bien situé avec une bouche de métro à 300m plus bas, le quartier est très vivant, beaucoup de restaurants et un petit épicier en extérieur qui reste ouvert tard le soir. <br/>Nous avons également beaucoup aimé les équipements du logement, la propreté également était bien présente et la décoration qui est super belle. <br/><br/>Je recommande à 100% ce logement entre amis ou en couple.

Location! <br/>Our first inclination was hesitancy because there were no other reviews for this apartment; however we were 100% pleased with our stay. Due to a last minute trip to Athens, we were pressed to find a place to stay for two nights on a layover to Mykonos. <br/>Philip was PROMPT and efficient. His team worked with us to allow us to enter the apartment early and store our luggage. We followed their suggestions for places to eat - Avocado is a MUST while in Athens. The apartment is SPACIOUS. It can easily accommodate four people with ease and comfort. There are two bathrooms - one full bathroom with a shower. Also a plus, there is a washing machine. We needed it desperately after sweating through the Athens streets. <br/><br/>Back to location, it is central to EVERYTHING! Syntagma Square is a prime location. There is also a free shuttle to the SNCC, which is a must visit while in Athens. Walking distance to everything else you need to see. <br/><br/>Thank you to Philip and his team. They immediately responded to our contact via (Hidden by Airbnb) while were in the airport and it made everything easy. <br/><br/>We would ABSOLUTELY stay here again! +++++"

30242530,633733763,2020-07-01,25820576,Stacy,"This flat is not sparkling clean like the photos, I think due to the fact that everything in the flat is old.  However, the location is right in the middle of the city, if you are visiting for sightseeing you won't find  place more convenient than this. Philip is very kind and helpful."

The host was very friendly, met us in person to show us around, and checked to make sure we had everything we needed! To note - the third bathroom is only a toilet but two showers was fine for us. Great big washing machine which came in handy as well as a desktop computer and printed plus an espresso machine!"

Τα δωμάτια είναι μικρότερα από ότι φαίνονται στις φωτογραφίες και το σπίτι είναι μάλλον σκοτεινό. Δεν μας έδωσαν 2ο κλειδί και έτσι έπρεπε να μετακινούμαστε όλοι μαζί. Γενικά δεν νομίζω ότι θα τους έδινα βαθμό super host.

30259207,604419336,2020-02-11,179217209,Elektra,"This is a solid choice if you want a modern apartment next to a blue-line Metro stop. Even in February, the weather was 50s-60s F on the balcony, and it was nice to see some gorgeous sunsets. There is a washing machine on the balcony, but no dryer. Because I stayed for over 10 days, I found myself doing a small load of laundry every 2-3 days, which meant I was continuously drying clothes in the living room on the large clothes drying rack. In winter, the clothes take 24 hours to dry. The balcony was too windy to put the rack outside. I loved the small kitchen, but mostly ate out since Greece is so affordable. I highly recommend the Indian restaurant ""Naan Stop"" that is a 5 min. walk away on an adjacent block. The elevator to the 6th floor worked seamlessly. There is an X95 airport bus stop called ""Galaxias"" that is around an 8 min. walk from the apt. where you can catch the airport bus when the metro is not working (after midnight). I caught a 3:12 am bus that was 6 Euros and we got the airport is record time (20 min. earlier than listed).  Bus only accepts Euros, but you can pay with credit card at Syntagma X95 bus stop if you want to beforehand. Note, I was the only person at that bus stop at 3 am and the bus nearly passed me, so you need to be facing the direction it comes from and wave when you see it to make it stop, otherwise it will pass you and assume you are waiting for a different late-night bus. There is a large supermarket nearby with many options that is a 10 min. walk from the apartment."

Η επίπλωση ήταν πολύ ωραία ενώ η εκπληκτική συλλογή από CD έδινε μια vintage ατμόσφαιρα. Η μεγάλη προσεγμένη βεράντα και η ανεμπόδιστη  θέα μέχρι τον Λυκαβηττό έκαναν ακόμα πιο ευχάριστη την διαμονή μας! Το προτείνω ανεπιφύλακτα και επιλέξω αναμφισβήτητα την επόμενη φορά!"

30259207,737033838,2021-03-07,162648402,Giasemi,"Having been in many Airbnb places over the last years I can confirm that Myrto’s place exceeded my expectations. Its location at the centre  of Athens and outside of the metro station allows you to be everywhere in the city you like or need very quickly. The studio has everything one needs even for long (over a month) stays. Not to mention that it’s literally sparkling clean. Additionally, it touched me the wonderful yet subtle scent in the room plus in the bathroom. But the strongest advantage of this place is its owners, your hosts. Their hospitality is second to none. They will treat you as their close friend. <br/>Honestly, I can’t recommend this place enough.<br/>Thank you Myrto and Antonis!"

My husband and I were working remotely and Myrto was very accomodating allowing us late check out. WiFi connection is excellent so I would recommend for anyone who needs access for work video conferencing. The apartment itself was spotless and a great size for two people. It was really handy having a washing machine and the outdoor balcony was beautiful to sit on in the evening. There is everything that you need including shampoo, shower gel etc. We really appreciated the water, drinks, bread, biscuits etc left by Myrto. There is a lovely bakery just next door and a supermarket with everything you need only 1 minute walk. We took the metro from the airport and this was very straightforward. We would highly recommend and hope to stay in future!"

Ted greeted us with much warmth and gave us some tips to get around the town. The apartment is sufficiently equipped as described and is also very clean. We love the big balcony with table and chairs. And love the fact that we have the entire place to ourselves. Ted gave us as much privacy as we need. On the day that we left, he helped to arrange a taxi as we had to leave for airport in the wee hours. <br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend Ted’s place to couples or groups of friends, young or old, to stay and explore the amazing Athens. <br/><br/>P/S: Ted’s family gave us a bottle of wine for the New Year Eve."

Мы были приятно удивлены мелочам: со вкусом подобранным декорациям, свечам, большим и ухоженным балконам, запасным одеялам, подушкам и полотенцам. Проблем на было. Но, думаю, что если бы что-то пошло не так, то решилось бы быстро - Тед всегда был на связи. Большое спасибо Теду и его маме!"

Brilliantly comfy sofas and chairs on both balconies, we had a great time reading  drinking and nibbling on them.<br/><br/>When we arrived, we found fresh oranges, cookies and coffee - great! The bed was comfy and the shower nice and hot, and we quickly felt at home at the top of the building (complete with a very interesting lift!)<br/><br/>Ted was also the most responsive host I've ever stayed with and nothing was too much trouble.

Not far away from the historical city center, it gaves us a home away from home for a few days while we explored the city, the port, and the beaches.

30261466,454884551,2019-05-19,883317,Teo,"Great apartment (truly worthy of its Airbnb Plus status), with fantastic terraces in a very nice neighbourhood (Koukaki - (Hidden by Airbnb) it and enjoy the reviews), only steps away from lots of bars and restaurants which fill up at night with young locals who create a lovely atmosphere. There's hardly anything you could wish for more in terms of comfort, location or amenities. I found the apartment spotlessly clean and the space expertly optimised, which made it feel very roomy and airy. Every single sitting/sleeping furniture in the house is very comfortable - the bed, the living room sofa or the large terrace U-shaped couch. I was alone in the apartment, but I can imagine how this would be the perfect place for a couple spending some nice summer days/nights in Athens. The place is only about (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes away from the Acropolis hill and and additional 5-10 minutes away from the busy and charming Plaka and Monastiraki neighbourhoods in the city centre, which means you can go about your daily sightseeing trips in central Athens and then return to your wonderful terrace and enjoy the peace and tranquility of the area over a glass of wine or maybe go for a very local meal and blend in with the locals only a couple of streets away. Whatever you choose to do, Ted's apartment is the perfect starting place for you and Ted is a wonderful, reliable and extremely helpful host (Cheers for the complimentary water, coffee and cookies!). Would absolutely stay here again, no doubt about that. Thanks, Ted! :)"

It is in the heart of Koukaki, but it is an oasis of calm, with two terraces, both beautifully planted to create a sense of privacy.<br/>The neighbourhood is full of excellent, reasonably-priced cafés, restaurants and bars, and the Acropolis district is only 15 minutes' walk away.<br/>It would be difficult to find better value."

No skimping on amenities - even the hair dryer was good quality. The balconies are even more beautiful in person, would recommend setting aside a few hours of your stay to sit outside and enjoy them. The location was absolutely perfect, especially for only having a couple of days to explore Athens. The restaurants, cafes, shops, and the metro is nearby, the apartment is easy for cabs to get to, and about a 10-15 minute walk to the Acropolis area. The neighborhood is quiet and safe and we felt comfortable walking around at night. Ted was a wonderful host and provided super helpful tips for taking taxis in Athens as well as restaurant recommendations. Any questions we had, we received a response within minutes. We didn’t want our stay to end! Will be recommending this listing to friends and looking forward to visiting again."

C’est la maman de Ted qui m’a chaleureusement accueilli et donner plusieurs endroit à visiter dans la ville. L’appartement est exceptionnel, un vrai petit havre de paix et à 10 minutes à pieds de l’acropole et de Plaka."
30261466,569654894,2019-11-27,75832442,Jie Won,"I highly recommend Joy Apartment! The family operated apartment was really comfortable, and its proximity to many of Athens grand attractions is unbeatable. <br/>The apartment is in short walking distance to Filopappou Hill, which has a grand view of the entire Athens, including the Acropolis. The cosy balconies (yes, there are two!)  make you feel right at home. All the restaurants Ted recommended that are in walking distance were amazing. (We ended up going to the sandwich shop 3 times). We walked and took metro everywhere during our stay. <br/>Ted is a great host - he made sure our stay is comfortable and took the effort to resolve small issue we had during check-in in a timely manner."
30261466,571474367,2019-12-01,170678821,Josie,"We received a lovely welcome once we arrived at the apartment. Ted (and his mother, who met us) were kind, punctual, and accomadating. Ted went above and beyond. Also there was a jar of great cookies waiting for us. The appartment has a lovely atmosphere with two huge and beautiful verandas. Well located near two great strips of restaurants, and only 10 minute walk from the Acropolis. The apartment is located on the top floor and has tons of bright lighting. It is clean, has a really beautiful bathroom, nice lighting, a big television, and a comfy couch. <br/>We had a magical time and would definitely return."
30261466,575043881,2019-12-09,25236652,Claudia,Casa fantastica!!! Tutto l'occorrente a disposizione per un soggiorno in pieno relax e vicino alle principali attrazioni della città; Ted è stato tempestivo nella comunicazione e i suoi genitori ci hanno dato un'accoglienza calorosa ma mai invadente!!

The balconies were huge with ample seating and views of the Parthenon. The only thing I felt missing was a washing machine and a dryer."
30261466,583050586,2019-12-28,18622926,Nataliia,"Great apartment. Clean and bright. Fully equipment. There is everything needed for your comfortable stay, like tea and sugar that looks like a small thing but all of these little things do your experience.<br/><br/>And for sure great balconies. We had breakfast there even despite bad weather. I wish I came here in summer to fully enjoy these great balconies.<br/><br/>The location is also very good. We didn't use public transport and get to all attractions by foot.  Parthenon is just 15 minutes away."
30261466,585753723,2020-01-01,152110760,Sanda,"This was the nicest place we could have chosen for our trip in Athena! Ted and his family are the most wonderful host. They have welcomed us even though we arrived late in the evening. The apartment is beautiful, cozy, sparkling clean!! and placed right in the center, at walking distance to the most important POI. Very well equipped with everything you may need... Whatever silly thing we asked for, like a big pot... they provided it in a minute. The terrace towards Filopappou Hill is what you dream for a vacation in Greece. The entire house was nicely decorated for Christmas so we felt the home's warmth so well. Ted's recommendations have been so useful! All these being said, Ted, we thank you for making our stay in Athena a memorable thing! And BTW- the wine was great!! Happy New Year!  :)"

The host, Ted, went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and at home. He met us at check-in and assisted with luggage, as well as at check-out. He provided us with a wonderful list of recommendations for the area and carefully went through all the details of the apartment.

30261466,601949458,2020-02-05,49420214,Benjamin,"Ted and his family were exceptional hosts. They were thoroughly communicative and equally hands-off as necessary. The apartment features two gorgeous, private terraces on the front and back of the building. The kitchen is small, but was totally functional for my short stay. Everything was immaculately clean. The location is a manageable walk to the center of the city. You're literally two blocks from Filopappou Hill with gorgeous hiking trails, and walking distance to a good metro line."

The whole place is recently renovated and sparkling clean, with all the amenities that you could need. And the best part — two amazing terraces in the heart of a picturesque neighbourhood. Walking distance to the Acropolis and historical landmarks, but thankfully not in the ""typical"" tourist neighbourhoods, where it gets loud and crowded. We could shop from locals and eat in tavernas where locals eat, so that was a big plus for us. Last but not least, Ted was an amazing host, replied instantly to any of our questions on (Hidden by Airbnb) and generally gave us a really good vibe :)<br/><br/>Don't miss this jewel! We will surely be back ^_^"

Die beiden Dachterrassen sind wirklich sehr schön, groß und toll grün durch die vielen Pflanzen. Die Einrichtung ist nicht mehr die Neuste, was überhaupt nicht schlimm ist, da die ganze Wohnung blitzeblank geputzt ist und man sich darin super wohl fühlt. Die Klimaanlagen im Wohnzimmer und Schlafzimmer funktionieren sehr gut und lassen einen Sommer in Athen toll aushalten. Das Late-Check-Out, das uns Ted, ermöglicht hat, hat unseren Abreisetag total entspannt gemacht und ist wirklich nicht selbstverständlich!"

30261466,424377375490243698,2021-08-08,33224535,Shannon,"We had a wonderful stay at Ted’s apartment. The location was great - close to the center but in a quiet area, easy to walk to everywhere. The apartment itself was lovely, super comfy bed and had everything you need - but the best thing was the two balconies. Such a nice way to spend a morning or evening. Would absolutely recommend this place!"

He met us at the apartment and gave us a detailed tour, as well as provided a guidebook and recommendations. The apartment was in a great location, close to public transportation and about a 15-20 minute walk to the Acropolis. The balcony view was amazing and we were surprised to find TWO balconies when we arrived. I highly recommend this spot and give it 5/5! Thank you so much Ted!"
30261466,467819143409589886,2021-10-07,38673863,Bence,"A very fancy little greek penthouse in the cool city of Athen. The two terraces are incredible, the view is also beautiful, the furniture are comfortable, it looks even better than on the pictures. The neighbourhood is very nice, Plaka and the Acropolis are near, but the nightlife is also great at the local pubs and restaurants right next to these streets. Ted is a great host, he gave many useful tipps and the check-in, check-out process was very smooth."

He gave some really good practical tips on taxis. <br/><br/>Also a late check in (we arrived at 2am) was not a problem and his mother was there to assist. Ted and his mother were also very attentive. We stayed there during an incredible storm and they slipped a note under the door asking if everything was ok and to let them know if we needed anything. <br/><br/>The place is well located in Athens. A 15 minute walk from the Acropolis and Plaka. The area where the apartment is located is very nice with excellent restaurants and away from the large tourist crowds. <br/><br/>If you have the chance, stay in Ted’s apartment. Great value for money and the terraces are amazing!"

Mattress is not enough wide  couldn't sleep well and tunr myself during sleep,that why decide to leave the flat,cause I was tired from the first night! I told the host she  called Athina she is friendly, but couldn't do anything for me ! She said If you dont liked you can cancel the reservation you will maybe get another mattress ,but it takes time!  it was for me  like she doesn't care for my issue or my problem  during my stay in her flat ! and of course the reservation has strict rules and no refund money,finally decided to contact Airbnb to find solutions and get out from the flat!"

30268642,417136905,2019-02-26,24903313,Aaron,"The place is all new and nice. The only thing we did not like was the neighborhood. Even though it’s close to the center, the area seems pretty gloomy, dirty and a little unsafe."
30268642,418032064,2019-03-01,189389548,Clément,Sokol is a good host very helpful !
30268642,419570064,2019-03-04,18225384,Gretchen,"This apartment was great for our family of 4 in Athens. Most importantly for us, the building felt safe and secure. It is at the edge of a rougher-feeling neighborhood but is a new and modern building among run-down or abandoned ones. The elevator was nice for getting to the roof where the terrace is just as lovely as pictured. Inside the apartment, everything was clean and easy and worked well (including wifi). The space is very small, especially with the couch folded out to a bed, but the balcony off the bedroom gave us the feeling of having a whole extra room. The kitchen is pretty teeny, and although we cooked in it just fine, it's probably better suited to plating takeaway and making coffee. Sokol was quick and easy to communicate with, had lots of recommendations, and left some welcome treats for us. We would recommend a stay here!"
30268642,432539718,2019-04-04,27055856,Julie,"L'appartement est fonctionnel, propre et très sécurisé. On s'y sent bien. Sokol est très réactif et communicatif. La petite tersasse privée ainsi que le petit roof-top sont un plus. Nous sommes à 3 minutes à pied du quartier Psiri et de la Place Iroon, très sympa pour manger et boire un verre. Merci beaucoup"

Прибытие было простым и удобным. Мы прибыли чуть раньше из-за дождя, оставить вещи - никаких проблем и спасибо за это! Единственное что смутило, что такое жильё находится на границе цивилизаций, в азиатском квартале мигрантов. Но они не буйные. В 5мин ходьбы вполне себе европейские кафе и бары. Вообщем, рекомендую! Для взрослых на крыше очень уютный lounge с видом на Акрополь"
30268642,435403558,2019-04-10,155213519,Natali,Sokol was really helpful and responded quickly to the questions we had. The place was very clean and cosy.

Very easy check in- keys are left in the locker, you can check in any time you want. Sokol is great host, very friendly and carring. The neighbourhood isn’t very nice but you’re only 5 minutes away from safer areas. I can truly recommend this apartment."
30268642,444000988,2019-04-27,104518433,Fish,"This place is truly amazing in terms of convenience and amenities. The heart of Athens, and other main attraction of Athens is all at a walkable distance. You will come across lots of cafes and restaurant in just about 10-15mins walk. The host here has the best hospitality and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Response were fast and host were very helpful. If you are thinking of getting to and fro from the airport, the host actually has a friend that can take you there at a very reasonable price too! Athens is a very beautiful country and when i come back here, i’ll definitely stay here again! Thankyou Sokol :)"

They would messaged me to see if everything was ok, answered my messages late at night and even prepared nuts and a small gift upon our arrival! The appartment was lovely, cosy and fully equiped. There even were apples and snacks in the frigde. The only flaw about the appartment is that it's located in a quite shady area and it's a bit scary to walk around late at night, especially for girls. Apart from that, I would totally recommend Sokol's place."
30268642,453250916,2019-05-15,143816113,Greg,Place itself is amazing but the neighborhood may turn some people off.

Although the area seems run-down, it is 5 mins walk from everywhere you want to be (downtown) and we didn’t have any issues walking at night. Sokol surprised us with decorations and wine for my boyfriends 30th birthday it was amazing. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
30268642,460033196,2019-05-28,60003337,Zhan,"Sokol was a fantastic host. He was very clear with the check-in instructions and accommodative when we arranged for a later check-out timing. Sokol and his wife were also quick to help us out when we misplaced their keys. There is also a simple but adequate gym in the apartment if you are looking for a quick workout. Overall, my friends and I have enjoyed the stay very much!"

30268642,465606420,2019-06-08,161539486,Jonas,"The apartment is very nice and offers everything you need for a nice trip to Athens. The part of the city seems run down, but within a 5 minutes walk one can enter the nicer regions."

Lots of places to eat around too.<br/><br/>The house is a very well equipped one, has many thoughtful touches, sparkling clean and beautiful. A welcome gift awaited us after checkin. The breakfast can be ordered and is delivered at doorstep <br/><br/>A large paid parking space is available right in front of the property too. Locality may not be great but definitely people just kept to themselves and given how secure the house is, we were very comfortable. Wish you a happy stay there!"

Angela and Sokol are very responsive and are ready to help with any queries you may have about the apartment or the area around. And the view from the top is fantastic! Just one thing to be careful of is the area. Make sure you keep all your belongings safely in your pockets as you walk around. We almost got pick pocketed once. Otherwise, the location is great, and most things are a walk or a short cab away. Would recommend!"
30268642,471734280,2019-06-18,12808944,Jessica,Wonderful stay at Sokol's! Our flight had changed and we arrived much later than expected and Sokol was still able to arrive a driver for us from the airport so we were able to have a easy and relaxing ride. The flat is centrally located with a beautiful rooftop view where we enjoyed the sunset on our last evening. Would stay here again!

If you are GIRLS TRAVELLING, get a taxi to drop you right in front of the entrance and wait you to get in, even if you think you can walk the two streets down from a lovely bar! They are only men on the streets during the day and at night none! But as said, the apartment and host were super supportive, so if you stick to this rule you will have a great time!"
30268642,493862978,2019-07-23,259952178,Nikola,Everything was extra clean and as in description. We had a nice stay.

30268642,501155096,2019-08-03,41645042,Agustin,Best apartment of all Athens!
30268642,503542613,2019-08-06,84871201,Lisa-Marie,"We had a wonderful 2 nights at Sokol’s place!<br/><br/>It’s isn’t big and we were four girlfriends staying there - but we’re young and didn’t plan to stay inside much anyways. It is the perfect place to stay at for a few nights while exploring the city!<br/><br/>As mentioned, we were out most of the time, but the kitchen would allow you to cook at home and eat on a big nice wooden table in the little living room. There is a filter under the sink so we even drank the tap water!<br/><br/>The bathroom ist pretty cool - chose between a normal shower head or what I like to call “the tropical rain shower”. It even cam equipped with amazingly smelling shower gel/ shampoo and hair conditioner - big thumps up! <br/><br/>Both, bedroom and living room, are equipped with individual AC’s and TV - perfect for people who have different temperature preferences.<br/><br/>Check-in was crazy easy - Sokol explained so well how to access the place and my sister was even able to check in a little before the official check-in time. Also a big plus! Check-out was just as good - we just left the key where we got it.<br/><br/>The view from the apartment isn’t great, because it goes into the courtyard. But no problemo - Sokol let us use the house’s roof top terrace, which made up for it hundredfold!!! Perfect for dinner with that acropolis view! Another pro about the “bad view” from the apartment - it is beyond quiet! Perfect for sleeping.<br/><br/>Luckily the place is located very near to the tourist center, which is exactly what we wanted. We wouldn’t recommend going home alone at night though, because the direct area around the apartment is a little sketchy. No women in the street (right from the entrance, the street left from it is fine!) and a bunch of druggies hanging out in deserted buildings. Cool graffiti / Street Art in the area though - almost bobo!  <br/><br/>Last but not least: There are a washing machine and a gym in the building - which can be used for s few coins I think. We didn’t need it, but it’s nice to know that the option exists! <br/><br/>Communication with Sokol was world class - would recommend 9,9/10! Maybe not your number 1 choice of place to stay at as a lady traveling alone. <br/><br/>Thank you Sokol!!!!"
30268642,504042447,2019-08-07,42100954,Ludovic,Très agréable séjour dans ce studio entièrement rénové.

Il y a un balcon privé, une terrasse commune avec vue sur l'acropole, une salle de sport et des casiers pour laisser vos valises si votre avion est plus tard que le checkout, c'est très agréable ! Entrée autonome mais Sokol est un hôte très réactif, il nous a donné des conseils sur le quartier et nous a souvent demander de nos nouvelles. Nous avons passé 3 jours à Athènes et avons pu tout visiter a pied car l'appartement est dans le centre."

30268642,527998919,2019-09-12,29998225,Zi Kang,"Most probably the best-value accommodation in Athens. It is equipped with more than enough facilities for a visitor it can be called a home from home! Sokol gave detailed information in regards to both the apartment and the city, and his taxi driver friend certainly made our journey much easier by taking us to and from the port with no hassle."
30268642,529124471,2019-09-14,274461509,Anna,"The Host extremely kind and caring. We were positively surprised by welcoming behaviour, how helpful and fast in answering our host was. We could count on him any time. Excellent position, few minutes to the center and  all amazing bars and restaurants. Apartment just a blast, in addition to it super amazing roof with Acropolis view ! There is no view from Apartment but you don't need it as the roof is awesome! You can chill, eat and have some nice glass of wine with spectacular views ☺ We can definitely recommend it!"

30268642,531657028,2019-09-18,75577836,Cheryl,"Sokols place was very enjoyable.  I read other reviews about the area, but we never once felt unsafe.  One thing that Sokol did that was very helpful was to suggest one of his friends for a taxi.  Not only did he pick us up, but he had a sign up for us to  find him.  It gave us comfort in knowing that we would get there safely.  Thanks Sokol!"
30268642,533920836,2019-09-22,50838246,Wigand,"Very nice apartment and a great host.  Sokol always kept in touch with us, wondering if everything was ok.<br/>The Apartment is just a 5 minutes walk away from the old town with hundreds of restaurants. Great to discover Athens in just 10 minutes by foot to the Akropolis. We will come back for a third time!"

The street and building from the outside looked dark but when we stepped into the apartment it was completely different. The location is great, 5 min walk from Monastiraki square. Overall a very good experience staying at this place and will recommend to everyone looking for a nice place to stay in Athens!"
30268642,545383511,2019-10-12,43568252,Maja,"I highly recommend this apartment. The host was so helpful and interested in us being comfortable and pleased. The apartment is near the city centre, but a little bit scary neighborhood and building was the safe space for us. I don't want to scare you, in my opinion it is the best neighbourhood and building you can choose in Athens."

Yes, it was in a “sketchy” location as our taxi driver was telling us but we didn’t feel unsafe the few times we were walking around. Very short walk to Monastiraki Square which was super convenient. Hosts were great at getting back with us super fast. Also great amenities! And the roof top hangout area was amazing!"

Posizione perfetta in quanto a piedi in max 15 min si raggiunge tutto. La strada non è il massimo, sporca e piena di edifici distrutti ma ha anche il suo fascino. Dentro L appartamento è molto carino è dotato di tutti i confort. Se venite a d Atene ve lo consiglio"
30268642,607009966,2020-02-17,1014050,Minerva,"This apartment is in a building that has been created for short-term rentals. The building is new and it is like staying in a hotel but with a small kitchen and a living room. In the kitchen you can maybe cook a simple breakfast or a pasta not much more than that. <br/><br/>The place is very confortable and clean and it has hotel like details which can be nice but don't expect to stay at a local's house. The place is quiet and the bed is confortable.<br/><br/>The people that runs it are quick to respond to any requests. They send you recommendations about places to eat and see. They are a bit too attentive for me as they ask everyday if everything was ok. But overall it was a very pleasant stay.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood is quiet dodgy. It's closed to Psirí, a great area full of restaurants and bars but it is a few streets out of this area and it feels a bit unsafe."

30270740,419532086,2019-03-04,232044737,Paola,"Υπέροχη φιλοξενία, το σπιτι είχε όλα τα απαραίτητα και με το παραπάνω! Τέλεια τοποθεσίας, πολύ ήσυχη γειτονιά. Συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα την διαμονή στον χώρο της Babi!<br/>Ευχαριστούμε πολύ!"
30270740,422839443,2019-03-12,29873521,Adelina,"Clean, central, nice host, netflix :), good place to spend a city break in Athens."
30270740,426880190,2019-03-22,189504757,Pia China,The host was extremely committed and pleasant throughout my stay! facilitating all kinds of information. the place is very well located and in perfect condition.
30270740,428451388,2019-03-25,56298402,Jorge,Cosy apartment very good located. Great views from the rooftop terrace. Babi was a nice host!
30270740,429851891,2019-03-29,159562774,Eneas,"Everything was perfectly fine, we would recommend this apartment and we would definitely come back if we visit Athens again some time!"
30270740,432840889,2019-04-05,7709650,Mike,"Babi's place checks all the boxes - location, value, responsiveness, and more. It's centrally located, close to all the fun restaurants, bars, and tourist spots, and a 4-minute walk from one of the biggest metro stations in the city. If I'm ever in Athens again, I'll be staying here."
30270740,433942163,2019-04-07,243720638,Robert,"Babi was great! The apartment is cozy, great value and near many restaurants. The area is a little sketchy though and I would not recommend walking through Psyri's main square with all your luggage. We did just that and three bottom feeders followed us out  and down the street but we managed to lose them in a bakery. With that said, the apartment building is very well secured so no need to worry."
30270740,436094692,2019-04-12,73436442,Anna,"Babi's airbnb was in a perfect location - about a 5-7 minute walk to Monastiraki square which has a view of the Acropolis. Babi was accommodating and went out of her way to send us restaurant/cafe recommendations in the area. The airbnb itself was incredibly clean, had all the necessary amenities (including coffee pods, small snacks and netflix abilities if that's something you want) and was very cute. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
30270740,439000139,2019-04-18,14808472,Adeline,"Babi's apartment is very clean and bright, with large windows and air-conditioning/heater.  The few days that we were there, it rained and was quite cool, so we were able to warm up the apartment. It is perfect for a couple. It is close to lots of eating places and a 5-10 min walk to Monastiraki metro station. We went to Zampano a few times which is just opposite, we had brunch there as we were too early for check-in and we went there again for breakfast before checking out.  There is also a bakery across the road which again, is very handy. The apartment is very secure and quiet.  The kitchen area is well stocked.  We only used the tea and coffee facilities and kept our milk in the fridge. The bathroom is small and compact.  The only issue I have is with the shower cubicle - the glass panel only covers half of the cubicle, unlike the UK where a shower cubicle will have a full-closing glass door.  We tried very hard to shower carefully, but in vain, the water would splash out and half the floor would get wet, including the bath mat. This is not a criticism, it is just how the Greek showers are designed -  we found this to be the same in another Airbnb in Athens and also  a hotel we stayed in Kastraki. So, if you take this into consideration, you will have a perfect time!  Babi was very kind and helpful and full of energy."
30270740,439581035,2019-04-19,77741508,Moira,"Babi’s place was very nice, small and clean. We stayed for just one night and it was perfect, close to food and the metro. We got in late and left early and Babi was great and accommodated our schedule by giving directions to checkin/out. Lovely clean apartment, perfect for a night in Athens!"
30270740,441713689,2019-04-22,34196784,Fabien,Very nice apartment in the heart of Psiri. Very good option for a weekend stay in Athens !
30270740,443475754,2019-04-26,41949689,Claudio,"Babi mi ha accolto con cordialità ed è stata prodiga di suggerimenti, inoltre parla bene in italiano. L’appartamento è proprio uguale a quello che si vede nelle fotografie, è molto silenzioso e comodo da raggiungere dall’aeroporto. Il quartiere di Psiri è autentico, un mix di attività artigianali bar e ristoranti, che lo rendono vivo a tutte le ore. Io inoltre ho apprezzato il fatto che in 10/15’ a piedi si puó  arrivare all’ingresso dell’acropoli e dell’antica agorá, del quartiere di plaka, ecc."
30270740,444608566,2019-04-28,20333223,Guia,"Beautifully redecorated, topped by a superb view from the roof top which was a great surprise! Babi is also a very nice host, happy to share lots local tips, which we greatly apreciated, I recommend !"

30270740,447770101,2019-05-04,60905617,Vivien,"Die Wohnung liegt circa 5 Gehminuten von der Metro Station Monastiraki entfernt. Die Sehenswürdigkeiten und die Innenstadt sind super zu Fuß zu erreichen. Die Wohnung ist exakt wie auf den Bildern dargestellt. Sie war sehr sauber und die Ausstattung war hervorragend. Babi hat die Wohnung mit Liebe zum Detail eingerichtet und es waren viele zusätzliche Dinge (Kaffeepads, Tee, Nudeln, Duschgel, Shampoo,...) vorhanden. Einen tollen Pluspunkt stellte das Rooftop mit dem Blick auf die Akropolis dar. Die Kommunikation mit Babi verlief easy über (Hidden by Airbnb) , sie antwortete schnell und gab hilfreiche Tipps. Für einen Städtetrip war die Wohnung perfekt und wir empfehlen sie definitiv weiter. Efachristó Babi :-)"

As it was our first trip to Athens we were nervous at first with the crowds and graffiti but it is natural to the city and no problem at all. Definitely worth staying in for the views and food options nearby

30270740,468282499,2019-06-12,60634972,Megan,Me and my friend had an absolutely amazing stay and completely exceeded expectations. Babi gave us some great suggestions about places to see and eat. <br/>The Bnb was in a great location and had a beautiful rooftop with an unspoilt view of the acropolis. <br/>The flat felt incredibly safe and had all the facilities needed for a long weekend with a fabulous bakery opposite the flat for morning pastries

30270740,473799052,2019-06-22,89054668,Dennis,"Very nice studio, small but perfect for a couple, clean, modern and very close to restaurants. Across the street is a bakery which opens at 6, which was very nice. The major sites are at walking distance and there is a shared rooftop balcony that has a fantastic view.<br/><br/>The check in was easy, flexibel and arranged with the airbnb app. Everything was explained very well and we had a nice stay here. Babi is an excellent host!"

30270740,477345991,2019-06-28,10410735,Brian,"Babi's apartment was excellent for us both. It's super clean, well organized and there's an abundance of natural light that is pleasing to the eye. It's also quite soundproof, as we didn't hear much of the noise outside during the night. Babi was an excellent host by sharing with us things to see in Athens and making sure that we were comfortable. Couldn't ask for a better host than her."
30270740,478601407,2019-06-30,124535325,Μαρία,Very nice place!

Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance, but still quiet so that you can sleep soundly. The bed is very comfortable and the air conditioning is pure bliss. I can only recommend this place for your trip to Athens."
30270740,485049705,2019-07-10,80294062,Styliani,"I have been to Athens stayed in airbnbs many times, but Babi’s flat was by far the best one. <br/><br/>Communication was excellent. She replied to our queries fast and apprehensively. She met us by the flat’s building and showed us the amenities. <br/><br/>The house was clean. Spotless. Babi even left us tiny haribo bags on top of the towels provided. She even provided a first aid kit, threat and needle mini kit. <br/><br/>Location is everything. It is walking distance to all the tourist attractions and close to bars, restaurants and super market. The metro station is less than 5 minutes away. <br/><br/>I have nothing bad to say about our stay or Babi’s flat. Would definitely book again if we come back to Athens. I recommend her flat without a doubt. <br/><br/>Thank you for your hospitality!"

30270740,495431778,2019-07-26,125146355,Anita,The flat is located near monastiraki square a really central area full of nice restaurants and cafes. It’s very easy to get around the city with the metro from there. The apartment is cozy and fully equipped. We loved staying there!

It’s pretty stylish, minimalist and contrasting, very very clean, loved it. <br/>As for the location when I just arrived I was amazed by the view from Monastiraki square which is less that 40 meters from the apartment; besides, as you walk to the place, you’ll realize there are tons of bars and restaurants around, which makes it a nice environment and of course you’ll have a lot of options to choose when you go out. <br/>The communication couldn’t be better, Babi was always very responsive and attentive, in general she’s a great host.<br/><br/>I would definitely go back to this place again."

30270740,526600314,2019-09-09,41576268,Rajat,"The location of the place is great. It is very close to all the locations and is very central. Restaurants and Cafe are within walking distance.<br/><br/>(READ FULL)<br/><br/>However, the place is really really small. The photos have been taken in a way to show it looks big, but it isn't. There is literally no space to keep your suitcase. If you leave them on the floor, the host will complain, as it may leave marks on the floor. The bathroom is rather extremely small and very poorly designed. It has a toilet seat, then shower area and then the basin sink. When you shower, the whole bathroom gets wet as there is no divider between the shower space and toilet. So if you want to wash hands later, you literally have to walk through the water logged shower and then back, in return making the apartment dirty. <br/><br/>Now if it's gets dirty, the host will complain and try to extract cleaning fees (which is already included) but wouldn't provide a vacuum cleaner or decent mop that you can clean on your own. <br/><br/>The host complained there was dirt on the floor and asked for extra cleaning fees. I then objected that yes, because there is such an issue with drainage and no vacuum cleaner.<br/><br/>While the location is great, just remember you get what you pay for."
30270740,527928017,2019-09-12,88905768,Lauren,"Very clean apartment, perfect for 1-2 persons. The location is absolutely perfect; within steps from bars, restaurants, etc. <br/>Also an incredible view of the acropolis from the shared rooftop. <br/>Would stay here again,"

The apartment was in a great location, not too close to loud taverns, but within walking distance of the train station and everywhere we explored.  She responded to messages very quickly and gave some good restaurant suggestions.  The apartment was stylish and clean.  We would definitely recommend staying at her property."

The nonsmoking and using hours of the terrace was a little inconvinient because I was dreaming of smoking my cuban cigar and watch the night view of Acropolis on rooftop. I would choose a place that allowerd this. These are small pleasures but it gives a lot meaning to the travel.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the apartment was very stylish. The shower was a little interesting, having the basin in it but it was fine.<br/><br/>It was very center location and easily walkable to all of the tourist attractions.<br/><br/>Thank you for the nice place."

Perfect location just a short walk from Monastiraki Square (one train ride from the airport!). Pictures are totally accurate. I loved the clean and uncluttered design. It is just steps away from the nightlife  and restaurants and bars of Psyri, but SO quiet! The location is prime, within walking distance of all the sights. Excellent communication and updates from the host, checkin and entry could not have been easier. An amazing value, could not be more pleased with my stay. Thank you!"

30270740,420785707601125153,2021-08-03,69034870,Sam,"Unit is exactly as depicted in the photos.  Small and simple space, but with all of the amenities you'll need for a pleasant visit. The location is really great - tons of little bars and restaurants in the Psyri neighborhood just steps from this building, and just a short 5 min walk to Monastiraki square and the metro station.  Definitely recommend for solo travelers or couples who plan on getting out to explore but need a place to crash at the end of the day."
30270740,422888872151233128,2021-08-06,130358306,Frida,"Everything about this place was prefect. My partner and I love to go out at night and the part of Athens that has all the night life is at your doorsteps. The place was just perfect. It was the best looking Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Babi’s attention to detail is insane. The place is BEAUTIFUL. She also leaves behind necessities that you might need on emergency, like a sewing kit, feminine products, hygiene products and so much more. The kitchen is so stocked it’s almost as someone lives there. Truly one of the best experiences. Also, we had trouble figuring out what key to use (our fault, we didn’t properly read the instructions) but Babi replied to us in seconds, literally. Just overall 10/10."

In a perfect location to the hip bars and restaurants of Athens, a bit removed from the more touristy areas of Plaka and Monastiraki. However these places are only a short walk away if desired. The space was clean and we appreciated the working A/C and amazing shower! We would definitely return again."

30270740,459818917116269900,2021-09-26,88161208,Brian,"This was a great location to stay in Athens. One, it is super close to Monastiraki Station which leads you to anywhere else if you wanted to venture outside of the main area. Two, all the main attractions are right there to see. Lastly, that area is where the locals also go out and eat/drink so the food there was amazing for low prices. The Airbnb was really nicely designed."

We did manage to find street parking, not a far walk to the apartment. VERY secure building, felt safe & comfortable. Literally one block away from the coolest neighborhood in Athens, we spent an entire night just walking the different streets and checking out all the bars/restaurants. The apartment itself was so cute, the decor encompassed the graffiti of Athens in a cool way. Babi left a little bag of gummie bears, towels, disposable slippers, and toiletries out on the bed for us which was a classy move. My favorite was the nespresso/keurig machine with 2 pods. It definitely helped for the early morning drive to the airport. Would definitely stay here again!"

30273577,355669219,2018-12-05,22164367,Andreas,"I had an amazing stay at Jordan and Alex's place in Koukaki.
I was in Athens to explore the city center and some historical sites and the location was just perfect.
A few minutes walk to Acropolis and the museum. Also it was really close to the subway station which was very convenient to move around.
The place is located on a pedestrian street full of cafes and restaurants but it was very quiet inside as it was on the back side of the building, so I couldn't have asked for more.
Jordan was very kind and helpful and even welcomed me with local wine and fruits, so the whole experience was so smooth and complete.
I recommend this place and I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Athens"

The apartment is nicely decorated and it feels nice to stay inside for Netflix as well. Some noise Saturday night from the bars next door but not annoying. It felt like my own apartment. I would go back in the future.
30273577,367208259,2019-01-04,6087588,Helen,Great place.<br/>Quiet no noise that kept us up from outside.<br/>We used kitchen facilities.<br/>Jordan had a bottle of wine for us.<br/>Fruit as well.<br/>Most of all good bathroom. <br/>Walk to metro station about 6/8 minutes.

But there are a lot of places to drink right next to the condo which look pretty nice.<br/><br/>Over all, great place!"

It's on a pedestrian street with bars and cafes, but super quiet! You also have everything you might need for your stay, and two very cool balconies to enjoy the sun. Jordan was very accommodating and replied to our messages instantly, we definitely recommend his place! Just a note for people who are on the taller/larger side, the bathroom/shower is quite small and might be a bit harder to navigate for a larger person. But was totally fine for us, average sized/height people."

The immaculate, recently updated apartment is in the heart of the vibrant, hip (and nontouristy)Koukaki neighborhood with lively outdoor cafes, shops, great coffee and yummy bakery, and a solid souvlaki spot right outside the door. Jordan was one of the best Air BnB hosts I’ve had and left a lot of thoughtful extras (a bottle of wine, fruit, biscuits). He even arranged to pick me up from the port and two days later drove me to the airport so I didn’t have  to worry about getting a taxi. Would stay here again in a heartbeat! Nice little place in a young hip ‘hood that gives you a real feel for how the locals live. Plus the most thoughtful host!"

30273577,464209820,2019-06-05,261933087,Karl,"The condo is located in a top urban area close to the acropolis and in a lovely street with many pubs and streetlife. Jordan was a perfect keeper, very friendly, personal, caring and with quick response to our questions. We were offered a reasonable transfer fom Rafina and later to the airport. Thank you for all! We can fully recomend the condo."
30273577,465705660,2019-06-08,11478315,Beatriz,Jordan was a great host - he was very accessible and all the contact was easy and fast. He was also very kind and leaved a wine for us and also some foods (what helped us a lot as we had just a short time in Athens) and left us entered the apartment before the check in time. The apartment is as charming as the photos and the street that is located is just amazing (and with a delicious and cheap souvlak in the corn).
30273577,470388787,2019-06-16,15772878,Stephanie,"Excellent location, very quiet and clean. They were flexible when I made a booking mistake and I really appreciate it- they saved our trip! Highly recommend this place!"
30273577,475913034,2019-06-25,12670234,Erene,"An A+ stay in my favourite part of Athens. This apartment is on the main floor of a building on a beautiful pedestrian street that’s very lively all day (though I never heard street noise because the windows face the back of the building). It’s 5 minutes from Syngrou Fix metro station and very walkable to the centre of Athens. Jordan was very welcoming and greeted us with fruit, wine, and juice waiting for us. The apartment is extremely clean, newly renovated, and well-equipped (full kitchen, and little thoughtful details like hair dryer, shampoo, etc all there). It was *hot* in Athens while we were there but the two AC units did the job perfectly. We would definitely stay again!"
30273577,482974651,2019-07-07,185318253,Camille,Very good welcome. The appartment is cosy and everything is consistent with the expectation of the photo.
30273577,486176565,2019-07-12,89615543,Mayra,"Great little place located in the middle of cute galleria of restaurants, walking distance to most places you'd like to visit as a tourist. Safe and quiet."
30273577,488431017,2019-07-15,12877480,Lindsay,"Great, modern condo in a cool neighborhood, close to everything"
30273577,493799392,2019-07-23,19419484,Cassandra,"I can absolutely recommend  Alex and Jordans apartment! <br/>The Airbnb is located in a super cute neighborhood central to all main attractions of Athens. We enjoyed having a quiet place to sleep and rest from our trips and at the same time we were able to enjoy delecious Greek food in various nice restaurants in front of the condominium. The apartment is very modern, new refurbished and has everything you need! <br/>The communication with the host was very fast and super friendly! All in all we had a great experience!"
30273577,499312069,2019-07-31,271251534,Popi,"Great host, quick responses, and great location!"
30273577,501129316,2019-08-03,30917066,Danielle,"Jordan was an amazing host. He responded quickly to messages since our first inquiry to us checking out. He arranged for our airport transfer and met us at the Airbnb. He gave us a tour of the place and local recommendations. He also had fruits, snacks, bottled water, and wine for us. The place is walking Distance to the Acropolis and Acropolis museum. The place also has a washer (one of the reasons why we chose this place!) Our clothes were able to dry after 1 day due to the heat outside. The place has two balconies which have remote controlled black out shutters - which is perfect for those that need complete darkness to sleep or need a daytime nap. The place also has two AC units (one in the living room and one in the bedroom). They were strong enough to keep us comfortable during the summer heat. There are plenty of places to eat nearby and a supermarket about a block away. I would recommend this place to anyone(not just because of the location but also because of Jordan’s hospitality)."
30273577,513168680,2019-08-19,184683290,David,"An amazingly stylish, comfortable and clean apartment in the best neighborhood for food and drinks!! Amazing"
30273577,514361362,2019-08-21,266034009,Zaneta,Perfect location. Great host.
30273577,524538657,2019-09-06,148911366,Daniela,Jordán respondió a todos mis mensajes rápidamente. El lugar esta muy bien ubicado. Y el Departamento esta muy limpio y moderno
30273577,528013184,2019-09-12,151625468,Cindy,The location is good!
30273577,528958824,2019-09-14,55067595,Leah,"Overall outstanding Airbnb experience. Jordan provides very quick and helpful responses. Great location, apartment, amenities and very thoughtful touches. Upon arrival Jordan greeted us and showed us around the apartments He left fresh fruit, water and wine for us in the fridge and other snacks as well. He gave us great recommendations for the area and was very quick to respond if we had any questions throughout our stay! He was very accommodating and helpful. Overall great experience and I would highly recommend staying here!"
30273577,531282278,2019-09-17,99830616,Chelsea,"We had a lovely stay, the location was great, within walking distance to everything we wanted to see. The apartment had everything we could have needed and the cafes just outside were great too."
30273577,532228148,2019-09-19,290380591,Jim,A great stay. 10 minute walk from the buzz of Acropolis and Plaka but situated on a fantastic street with bars/restaurants perfectly suited for a more laid back experience too. Apartment is spacious and clean. Jordan was a great host and gave us some brilliant local tips so we got the most out of our two/three day visit. Highly recommend.
30273577,535803195,2019-09-25,33091296,Sarah,Alex and Jordan’s place was clean with great amenities. Jordan provided great tips and welcomed us at the door. 10/10 hospitality and would recommend!
30273577,538715700,2019-09-30,75275953,Yamiley,"If you’re in Athens, this is the place to stay. Jordan was such a gracious host. He responded promptly to my many questions and was always available. Jordan is very kind, hospitable, and I appreciated that he made this Airbnb feel more like a home to his guests by leaving complimentary snack, fruit and beverages. He also arranged transfer for us from the airport and to the port on the morning of checkout. Aside from that, the location is truly superb. The Acropolis, Plaka, and more are so close by walking. Also there are tons of taxis on the street or you can even use Uber because they have a partnership with the taxis in Athens. The apartment is literally steps away from bars and restaurants. Jordan, thank you again for all your suggestions and making our experience a great one."
30273577,542306159,2019-10-06,92476464,Yiota,"Airbnb is never my first option but I was extremely happy to have discovered this place in Athens! The neighbourhood of Koukaki is a very vibrant and charming area, full of cafés that serve coffee and brunch, tavernas with small meze dishes and grill houses for traditional souvlaki and pitas, all of then in reasonable prices addressed to locals (price-wise), contrary to all the tourists traps in Athens. The flat itself was immaculate, stylish and quiet (it is in the back side of the building), although it is located on a very lively street that on a Saturday night was unbelievably busy with friends sitting out enjoy their company, a very greek image of everyday life. <br/>It had all the amenities that are outlined, welcome details, fruits, coffee and greek products to try. <br/>The host, Jordan, waited for us (we arrived at 02:00) and explained everything we needed to know, suggested walks and places to visit, and gave us tips on how to move around (even though all you need is your feet to walk and contemplate every aspect of that area which is 5’ from Acropolis, historic quarters and hills of the centre of Athens). <br/>The apartment was spotless, professionally cleaned and arranged.<br/>I am very very happy with everything, so much that I would go back only for this experience again.<br/><br/>An extra thing to mention is that I regretted not taking his advice (prior to our arrival) when I asked for information about the transport from the airport. If you want peace of mind, especially if you arrive after midnight, do consider asking him for a professional private transport from the airport!"
30273577,544013840,2019-10-09,285723700,Jesse,"My partner and I had a great time in Athens staying at Jordan's place. Check-in was easy and efficient. Jordan was kind enough to provide some snacks, juice and wine for our arrival. Any queries were answered quickly and clearly.<br/>The apartment was cosy, fairly modern and  in a good location for lovely restaurants and shops. Full kitchen & wetroom. Excellent AC in living + bedroom. Pleasant balcony overlooking a gap between apartment blocks and some greenery.<br/>We did find the 5-10 min walk to/from Fix metro station a bit tiresome after the 6-7th time but if you're used to walking it's no big deal. It's worth noting that the neighbourhood is not very tourist-y. The apartment-block entrance is slotted between two bars and opposite another. We tried our very best to immerse ourselves in the culture but the constant staring from bar-goers every time we came and went did make us feel slightly out of place!<br/>Overall a great city break and we wouldn't be opposed making this our home-base once again if we visit Athens sometime in the future :-)"
30273577,545377658,2019-10-12,5183592,Drew,Great space and cool neighborhood. Jordan was fantastic and had great personalized recommendations.
30273577,548214697,2019-10-17,104257341,Erica,"Loved Jordan & Alex's place! Perfect neighborhood. Restaurant's are right at the building's door step, yet far enough that you don't hear the street noise. The transfer service provided was excellent! Jordan greeted us and he was very hospitable and available anytime we had questions. Definitely felt like we were being  taken care of by family! Fruit, snacks, and a bottle of wine were provided in their home. Highly recommended if you want to be in a cool local area yet walking distance to public transportation and walking distance to the famous attractions!"
30273577,551221690,2019-10-20,68891473,Claudia,"Perfect place to stay. Very central in a super modern and vibrant area, but quiet inside. Clean, nicely furnished. Can highly recommend this place."
30273577,553793263,2019-10-25,150861629,David,"We really enjoyed our stay.  The apartment is in an excellent location with some lovely bars and restaurants literally outside the front door.  However, the apartment was really quiet and very clean and comfortable.  Its is also easy to get to all the main tourist sights in Athens and yet is away from all the tourist areas.  You will feel very much like a local as you eat and dine alongside them.  Highly recommended"
30273577,557479160,2019-11-01,54106444,Cindi,"Alex and Jordan's place is a gem! Tucked in a quiet and comfortable neighborhood, the condo is well-appointed and comfortable. We appreciated the bottles of water, wine, and fresh fruit that were provided to us upon arriving, and Jordan very kindly met us to show us the condo and tell us about the immediate neighborhood, where we had some very good dinners, and enjoyed grabbing pastries and coffee every morning. The condo is a five minute walk from the subway, and about 10-15 minutes from the Acropolis, and is really an incredible value. We couldn't have picked a better place to lay our heads for a few nights in Athens!"
30273577,559543115,2019-11-04,15874228,Sarah,"This is the perfect place. It is quite, but close to everything. Incredibly clean and stylish. Even booked a safe taxi for us when we needed to get back to the airport in the middle of the night and provided lots of tips for exploring the city. Couldn’t recommend staying here more."
30273577,565162188,2019-11-17,45390470,Alfonso,"My experience with Jordan was excellent. Always ready to help. It is close to the acropolis. The pedestrian street of the househas a mall, tres and bar ,coffes and vry nice restaurats. I strongly recommend it and on mi return i will do it in this  place."
30273577,576020009,2019-12-12,20955544,Naomi,"This apartment is a comfortable place to stay in Koukaki, 15 mins walk from the City Centre. It is situated on a pedestrian street with plenty of places downstairs for a meal or drink. The apartment is at the rear of the building so while the balcony doesn’t open to the street below you won’t be bothered by any of the noise from the bars. I found the location perfect, and felt safe walking around late at night by myself. <br/>The apartment is basic but has a newly renovated kitchen and bathroom and the water pressure is perfect (not always the case in Athens!). There is a washing machine and a fully fitted kitchen, although no microwave. I baked cakes and cooked meals during my three week stay. Heating is good and the bed was comfortable.<br/>There are a few stairs (10 or so) to get into the apartment but it is on the ground floor so no barring shopping up flights of stairs. <br/>I would stay again without hesitation, especially with the friendliness and responsiveness I had from the host."
30273577,586646210,2020-01-02,38320625,Leonid,"A clean, very quite, well located apartment.  Good facilities and wi fi. Jordan is very helpful, attentive and easy to communicate with. We enjoyed our 5 day stay.  Recommend wholeheartedly."

30273577,594246320,2020-01-18,28213095,Gabi,"Die Wohnung ist zentral gelegen. Die Küchenausstattung ist sehr gut. Wasser, Saft, Obst und ein paar Sachen zum Kochen waren da. Nicht gut: Warmwasser muss man erst 10 Minuten anschalten, dann kommt es warm, aber nicht heiß. Es reicht auch nicht zum Haarewaschen. Die Matratze war nicht so bequem. Wer da nicht so hohe Ansprüche hat, kann die Wohnung aber bedenkenlos mieten."
30273577,599813860,2020-01-31,327121031,Yasmina,"Both Alex and Jordan were very friendly, reactive and accommodating. Everything went smoothly, the flat was perfect and very well located. Highly recommend!"

30273577,607112867,2020-02-17,182138438,Sofia,"Η διαμονή μας στο σπίτι ήταν εξαιρετική! Το σπίτι βρίσκεται σε έναν υπέροχο δρόμο στο Κουκάκι, γεμάτο ζωη χωρίς όμως αυτό να αποτελεί πρόβλημα σχετικά με θορύβους κτλ, δεν υπήρχε φόβος να περπατήσεις οποιαδήποτε ώρα καθώς υπήρχε κόσμος! Επίσης, το διαμέρισμα είναι πολύ κοντά στο μετρό, λεωφορεία και το τραμ. Ένας χώρος πολύ όμορφος, ωραία διακοσμημένος, καθαρός και φωτεινός, ακριβώς όπως στις φωτογραφίες! Πολύ καλή σχέση ποιότητας - τιμης. <br/>Σχετικά με τον Ιορδάνη: εξυπηρετικότατος οικοδεσπότης, πολύ ευγενικός, κατατοπιστικός και έγκαιρος  όσον αφορά τις πληροφορίες για την άφιξη στο διαμέρισμα! <br/>Συστήνεται ανεπιφύλακτα!!! <br/>Ευχαριστώ πολύ!"
30273577,614421631,2020-03-05,144267167,Dmitry,"I have only positive comments. The things that I liked the most were the balcony that was sunny in the late morning (I come from a no sun country), nice places to eat very close to the apartment, total silence in the bedroom at night (the bed was so comfortable I was afraid to oversleep my flight), and that the host was very welcoming, gave some nice tips and left snacks, water and fruits."
30273577,616251823,2020-03-09,28710817,Konstantinos,"A very warm, cosy apartment in an amazing location run by truly hospitable people. Really felt like home in this beautiful and thoughtful unit. Totally recommended!"

Jordan was a great host with quick responses and very accommodating."

30273577,712168863,2020-11-29,26203256,Niall,I really could not be any happier with my stay in Jordans place. He was extremely helpful and quick to reply with any questions I had. I stayed here for a month and his home had all the necessary amenities to live in for such a period of time. The home is also extremely comfortable to be in and a generally warm and welcoming setting. The location is also perfect. It is located about a 10 min walk from plaka and the acropolis and 15-20 min walk from the main shopping district. The neighbourhood also provides for anything that you may need with shops and restaurants. I would stay here again without hesitation. Thanks again Jordan for everything.
30273577,754603834,2021-05-03,3576302,Chris,Nice flat with a friendly host who welcomed me with some nice extras in the apartment.

Die Klimaanlage in beiden Räumen runden das Gesamtpaket ab.<br/>Direkt vor dem Haus befindet sich eine Meile aus verschiedensten Restaurants und Bars. Auch wenn diese abends sehr gut besucht ist hört man im Appartement rein gar nichts. Eine super Bäckerei ist auch direkt gegenüber, man muss  sich also um das  Frühstück keine Gedanken machen. Ich kann diese Unterkunft mit besten Gewissen weiterempfehlen."

30279544,458610765,2019-05-26,70722792,Lina,One of my best Airbnb experience. The description is accurate and you really get a great view of the Acropolis.
30279544,461688330,2019-06-01,143327912,Vanessa,"The flat was in an excellent location.  Iaonnis, our host, was extremely nice and helpful throughout the stay.  He checked in with us a couple of times.  The flat had a unique vintage decor.  It was very clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The view of the Acropolis is from the side and kitchen window, not the patio.   There is no where to put up your clothes/suitcase out of view.  This did not bother us, thus the 5 star rating.  Just wanted others to know that there is a long bench near the dining room table for the suitcases and depending on how neat you are your clothes may be fully in view of the rest of the flat."
30279544,472606890,2019-06-20,262618971,Maria Lucia,"Thank you, Chara-Joy and Yiannis for a great stay in Athens. We loved your place, waking up to the the spectacular views directly from the comfortable bed. Entire  place immaculate. Best regards, Les and Maria from Calgary, Canada"

We felt at home since the first minutes. Yiannis checked on us everyday and gave us some useful tips. I highly recommend this apartment and I thank both Yiannis and Chara for their hospitality. See you next time maybe "
30279544,506832147,2019-08-11,53255875,Dave,"From the moment we made our booking, Chara and her father Yiannis were wonderful with tips on how to get there and then things to see and do whilst there. The place is amazing with fantastic views as seen in the photos and central to everything.  You couldn’t pick a better spot to stay, please don’t hesitate to book if it’s available.<br/><br/>We’ll be back "
30279544,512215138,2019-08-18,69448781,Mandana,"Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful place with us. The flat is stunning from inside and has breathtaking view to one of the most historical and beautiful monuments in the whole entire world. We actually started exploring the history from the minute we entered to the apartment with your amazing and great taste of design. The flat is right at the heart of Plaka, which is accessible to all restaurants, shopping centres, bus and metro stations and all of historical monuments. There was an open communication at all time with the host, which provided us with a better understanding of our stay in the flat and to better know the neighbourhood. The location is perfect. It gave us the opportunity to explore and come back to rest for couple of hours before the second rounds. Everything’s in the apartment is beyond perfect. The view from each corner of the apartment to Acropolis cannot be described by words, you need to be there to feel it. We had such a great time at home away from Home and Hope to come back soon. Thank you Yiannis for everything."
30279544,520249896,2019-08-30,8471346,Dmitry,"Chara's father Yiannis assisted us with this booking, and I must say, he was one of the most considerate hosts I ever stayed with. He greeted us at the apartment on time, showed us around, gave us amazing suggestions for things to do, responded immediately with any questions, and checked in to see if we needed anything. When I made a mistake on my booking, he went out of his way to help me fix it even though he didnt have to. The apartment was perfectly located in a cool area, had a great view of the Parthenon, and had a really beautiful classic artistic vibe to it. But the most memorable part was the hospitality. What a kind man!"

30279544,539347564,2019-10-01,205318778,Matthew,"My wife and I stayed here for four days during our first trip to Athens. It was, in short, amazing. The view is better than the pictures convey and the apartment itself is stylish, contains all the amenities you'll require, and contained many interesting items. The location could not be more perfect. <br/>Yiannis was a superb host that was very quick to respond to our enquiries and he gave us great recommendations for food in the area. If you are going to Athens, this is the place you want to stay."
30279544,541361828,2019-10-05,70282901,Dana,"What a rare find. An amazing view to go to sleep to and wake up to. The house is close to everything there are even a few bars right across the street. We were able to walk to every place we wanted to go. The apartment is so much bigger than the photos suggest and Chara- Joy and her father couldn't  have been more helpful and accomodating. Having an elevator was a big plus, but you should know that it is a typical European elevator and it is quite small.  Great hot water in the shower! The best we had on our three week trip."
30279544,546933568,2019-10-14,842991,Alexander,"Perfect location, stylish design, fantastic view. You can't look for anything better. Will recommend the apartment to all our friends."

30279544,561308172,2019-11-09,156384587,Davis,This location was a fantastic place. It met all great criteria. It had a kitchen that was easy to cook in. All kitchen supplies for cooking were available. Layout of the Airbnb was very nice. The view from the windows of the Parthenon was excellent. This location was worth its weight in gold. It was within short walking distance to all Sites and Metro systems. I highly recommend utilizing this Airbnb when you travel to Greece. Our host was also very hospitable. They answered all and any questions we needed. Amazing place to stay. We would come again and stay at this place.
30279544,620195733,2020-03-21,3366146,Tarquin,"A lovely penthouse with an amazing view, great location and the most charming hosts. Fully equipped and elegant, one feels instantly at home. Near to the Acropolis, the view of which dominates the apartment, you are surrounded by cafes and restaurants but in a calm romantic pedestrian only street."

The host has a lot of adresses to suggest for everything you might need. There is no wonder we will come back even only for this apartment !"
30279544,651191949,2020-08-15,9972625,Jaime,A really beautiful and stylish apartment with an outstanding view of the Acropolis from your bed! <br/>Perfect location with a short walk to all main sites and some lovely wine bars just outside if you want to grab a local aperitif before you head to Plaka’s main restaurants. Very attentive and responsive hosts - has it all really!

Toller Blick aus der Wohnung. Super nette Kommunikation mit Chara/Yiannis. Großartige Gastfreundschaft: Wir haben uns sehr wohl und willkommen gefühlt. Jederzeit wieder!"
30279544,655962763,2020-08-24,5630462,Marc,"Perfect apartment in a perfect location! Ideal spot to explore Athens from. Chara was away but her father Yiannis was on hand with many great recommendations. His help was much appreciated. The apartment had everything you need, including hair dryer, iron and coffee machines! The pictures do not do the view any justice, it is incredible!! Thanks again! We will be back."
30279544,657189050,2020-08-28,86481456,Antonella,"Yiannis and Chara’s studio is very central - you have bars and nightlife just outside the door! Close to everything in walking distance, which was a great plus for us. On top of this, we found biscuits and jam for breakfast and cold water already in the fridge. We felt at home! Thank you both!"
30279544,400468057053589073,2021-07-06,169128178,Sumandhi,"Highly recommended! An outstanding + astounding AirBnb, wow! This flat did not disappoint, every detail attended to with a spectacular view of the Acropolis (which was even able to be enjoyed from bed)! The aesthetics of the space are unique and tasteful, huge floor to ceiling doors + large windows throughout accompanied by thick drapes to escape the dramatic sunlight in the morning. Although there are bars on the street level, we never heard it inside since the space seems to be shockingly sound proof. The flat is on the 5th floor which provides the insane view; there is an elevator that drops you off at the flat door. Seriously, can't think of a single improvement to mention, anyone who stays here will be awed.  The easy espresso machine was a fabulous touch which we enjoyed every morning on the lovely balcony. Also I should mention that Yiannis + Chara were very communicative, available, charming and kind! The value provided in this booking is simply out of this world. The location is excellent!!! Close to everything- shopping, cafes, restaurants, we walked everywhere. Pro Tip: If you need a place to stash your luggage for the day, there is a safe, clean and secure place called the Locker Point located at 17 Nikis that is just a few blocks away.<br/><br/>A big thank you to Yiannis + Chara for making our trip so special!"
30279544,402585879098271988,2021-07-09,2513922,Sonia,I cannot thank enough Yanni’s kindness and attentiveness. He was so caring and checked with us daily. We had amazing food thanks to his restaurant recommendations. The place is amazing and the view spectacular!

30279544,411326857491981294,2021-07-21,411720426,Navin,You just have to experience the place. Yiannis and Chara are well experienced hosts and truly care that you have a pleasant stay. Simple things like making sure there’s coffee and snack after you have traveled for 18 hours make a big difference in the experience of the country and the people.<br/><br/>Location is spot on. You just can’t go wrong with the house. Coffee was too good. I have stayed in many Airbnb homes … this is probably the first one where the articles in the house itself are so incredibly interesting. There are artifacts from all around the world. There are books from 1839 and 1887. <br/><br/>So while you will enjoy the city you will also cherish the home.
30279544,415625669277588322,2021-07-27,43331218,Brian,This is a wonderful flat with bohemian charm and is very comfortable.  The Acropolis view is even better than the photos and changes colour and character all day.  We really enjoyed being in the heart of the Plaka district.  Yiannis gave us great restaurant recommendations and was there to welcome us in when we arrived.  We would definitely return to this very personal home.  Loved it.
30279544,422854488063681568,2021-08-06,139916610,Natale,A real 5 star stay! This flat is in an amazing location next to all the restaurants and shopping. The host communicated with us every day making sure we had everything we needed and offering advice and recommendations. The view is just like the pictures… only better in person. Very romantic and charming flat. Do yourself a favor and book!

It's wonderful to see the Acropolis from every window. The rooms are beautifully decorated with everything you need. The bed is super comfortable. Chara was out of town, but Yanniss answered every question and helped with every need, including what to do when one of our passports was stolen (go to the proper police station, you'll need the police report at the US Embassy). Thank you Yanniss and Chara for the opportunity to stay in your lovely place and we hope to be back soon."

30283317,432258046,2019-04-03,177358052,Tori,"Sokol's place is a god choice for someone wanting to stay within a 10-minute walk of the city center (specifically Monastiraki). Warning - the location is in a bit of a rougher area than I was expecting - nothing severe but as a younger woman I was cautious. However, the building itself is very secure - the front door and every room is locked, requiring a code or key.<br/>The apartment itself is small but pleasant and has all the basic items you would need. I would recommend it to single and double travelers who don't plan on being in the apartment much but want a cozy spot to return to. Sokol is also very communicative. He gave excellent instructions for getting into the apartment and checked with me throughout the week to see if I needed anything."

30283317,443164555,2019-04-25,79221881,Minji,시설도 너무 좋고 편의시설도 없는게 없을 정도로 잘 갖춰져있어서 너무 편했어요. 위치는 신타그마 광장에서 조금 멀리 떨어져있는 편이에요. 중심지에서 떨어져 있어서 그렇게 안전하다고 느끼지는 못했어요. 안 좋은 동네에 갑자기 좋은 건물이 딱 있는 느낌! 그래도 집은 정말 좋습니다 화장실도 좋구요! 아 그리고 위치가 차이나(?) 타운 같은 곳에 있어서 아시안 마켓이랑 진짜 가까워서 좋았어요. 그리고 서비스는 정말 최고입니다. 문자도 바로바로 보내줘서 의사소통이 편해요.
30283317,443945747,2019-04-27,97801948,Kristin,"Sokol is an amazing and helpful host and the apartment is adorable, would definately stay here again :) thanks Sokol!"
30283317,446284346,2019-05-01,21230849,Danny,"Awesome studio with high-quality amenities. View from the roof deck is amazing, better than the pictures! The location is very central but the block around the place is a little rough. Overall, worked out great for us!"
30283317,446812878,2019-05-02,173063364,Blair,"This place was great. Nice bathroom, which is important to me. The hot even arranged for a taxi driver to pick me up at the airport, which was a nice touch.   It was more expensive than I thought it should be. But very nice apartment."
30283317,450064373,2019-05-08,252855562,Teodora,"Very good communication with Sokol, he was always available for any questions and help. We are very thankful to him! And the place was just how you see it in the photos."
30283317,453580087,2019-05-16,112944489,Sonny,Great spot near some fantastic restaurants and close to museums and the acropolis. Just keep in mind the only bed is a pull out sofa which might not be really comfortable for side-sleepers but it was fine for me!
30283317,457954975,2019-05-25,201176045,Christian,Sokol's place and him self are extraordinary I've never had an Airbnb that looks so nice hes also outstanding in how attentive and nice he is. The only thing that wasnt good was the area it's in but it's not that bad to get out of and he cannot control that.
30283317,459192608,2019-05-27,186524358,Audrey,The room is clean and well decorated. The bed is comfortable. The bathroom is well designed and clean. The rooftop is really nice. There are tables and a window so you can see the acropolis. The instructions are really clear.
30283317,460848819,2019-05-30,120630872,Amy,"We loved our stay at Sokol’s. The apartment is beautiful and extremely safe and secure. The rooftop access gives the place 6/5 stars, it gave us a perfect view of a stunning sunset. I traveled here with my sister who studied abroad in Athens and knows the area well so we specifically picked this place because of how close it is to everything. I’ve seen comments about the area being unsafe but it truly is not. It may look a little rough but we have never felt unsafe in Athens even late at night. Sokol provided amazing hospitality, he was always available to us and even had a souvenir awaiting our arrival. Check-in was seamless and perfect because we arrived in the middle of the night. In the check-in guide Sokol wrote any information we would need to know which was extremely helpful. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Athens!"
30283317,461256643,2019-05-31,55433530,Caroline,"Très beau logement, idéal pour découvrir Athènes. C’est vraiment très calme, nous avons adoré! Je recommande fortement"
30283317,463918652,2019-06-04,258878423,Mariana,"Sokol was a great host. Although we didn’t meet once, check in was easy, he aided in helping me find transportation from the airport and to the port and he responded very quickly. The apartment was sparkling clean and easy to access with a beautiful rooftop that overlooks all of Athens."
30283317,464202726,2019-06-05,158885907,Nathan,"We were shocked with the service. My girlfriend and I have been using air bnb all around europe and this is by far the best one yet. The host was incredible kind, had great communication and recommended transportation and places to go. The room made us feel very safe in the city, and we were even able to check in early, because of our flight. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to be right in the middle of Athens. 5 stars!"
30283317,464603780,2019-06-06,109839154,Lauraly,"We were staying here on a layover. Got to see Athens which was great. Very cute, hip spot. The vending machine is pretty sweet. Owners were kind and quick with responses."
30283317,465176341,2019-06-07,37266006,Ana,"This is a small but nice apartment, it has everything you need and the location is good.<br/>Some snacks were provided, the place was clean and the checkin and checkout were super easy since the keys are provided in a key box.<br/>The host also helped arranging transportation from the airport. Nice overall."
30283317,471749331,2019-06-18,13786853,Lisa,"Sokol hat wahnsinnig schnell auf unsere Nachrichten geantwortet und sich regelmässig nach unserem Wohlergehen erkundigt. Die Wohnung war, wie auf den Fotos dargestellt. Sie lag sehr zentral, jedoch war das Viertel etwas düster. Man sollte sich Abends nicht unbedingt alleine dort aufhalten."
30283317,475357461,2019-06-24,81077683,Michael,"Sokol’ attentiveness is really what did it for us. First, since I landed he always asked if there was anything I needed, whether a taxi ride or suggesting somewhere to eat. Lastly, the room is amazing; honestly I couldn’t have asked for a better location- everything was within walking distance and the scenery- I’m sorta of a graffiti enthusiast and you really get to what Athens has to offer on that aspect. Overall, Sokol really made a great impression for my first trip in Europe."
30283317,477361673,2019-06-28,164235115,Catherine,"This is a modern, clean and stylish apartment. It is really close to central locations and public transport. Amazing hospitality! Only downfall was the neighbourhood didn’t feel very safe. I was very glad to have my boyfriend with me."
30283317,480124451,2019-07-02,57186572,Wing,"The owner is great. The building is nice and have elevator. The room is clean and water pressure is great. The neighborhood is bit spicy during the night, but great during day time and we two Chinese girls are comfortable to go in and out during the day time. The owner is great!"
30283317,481099937,2019-07-04,145065352,Nia,Was a nice place. Easy walk to the main square

30283317,486715017,2019-07-13,27735134,Alizée,"L’appartement est parfaitement propre, conforme à la description et bien équipé. Sokol est très réactif et attentionné ! L’emplacement est idéal pour visiter Athènes à pied et être au calme pour autant (petit plus pour le rooftop aménagé) !"
30283317,493895736,2019-07-23,80800741,Tsung-Yen,"The room is very clean, cosy and comfortable. Host is very helpful. Highly recommended to stay at this place."

30283317,499173022,2019-07-31,42698727,Adrien,Encore merci à notre hôte pour son accueil et son aide précieuse ! Nous avons vraiment apprécié notre court séjour sur place. On recommande ! <br/>Adrien et Eleanor.
30283317,501049824,2019-08-03,3882460,Paola,"The location is closed to Monastiraki and to Ancient Agora. Although it is closed to the public market, it is not dangerous. We even walked and purchased some groceries for our short stay. Sokol was asking all the time if everything was ok and we appreciate his dedication. Thanks for everything!"
30283317,505461938,2019-08-09,95144536,Marcella,"L’alloggio è un piccolo ma funzionale appartamentino situato in una posizione centrale e strategica nella città. <br/>L’host è davvero molto disponibile e premuroso. <br/>La cura al dettaglio è davvero ottima! <br/>Abbiamo apprezzato la palestra, la comunicazione con l’host e la possibilità di avere un deposito bagagli."
30283317,509295139,2019-08-14,4161630,Maïté,Nice appartement but a bit noisy
30283317,512061646,2019-08-18,243665785,Cláudia,"O love the house, very small but very pratical, had everything to cooke if you want, and Sokol is a great host."
30283317,515483618,2019-08-23,69693698,Natalie,Well thought out space with everything you need for a quick stay. 10 min walk from plakas. Neighbourhood is a little run down for about 5 minutes or so on the way but was quiet
30283317,516392933,2019-08-24,50557335,Sandra,"Sokol was an amazing host! His place is beautiful and clean, and located in the heart of athens, near all of the tourist attractions! Sokol went above and beyond to ensure that we felt at home, and constantly helped us out and provided many useful tips and tricks for navigating through Athens. Thank you, Sokol!"
30283317,517101527,2019-08-25,55584127,Candace,"Sokol is a fantastic host! He accommodated our early flight and had a driver ready to pick us up at the airport and take us to store our bags in the airbnb while the room was being prepped. The driver then took us straight to the Acropolis explaining that if we didn't go immediately we would be bombarded with tourists. Boy was he right! Sokol's place is quite warm at night, be prepared for that. We would have loved additional AC or maybe a bed of ice to lay on, but, that is Greece in general! It is HOT! This did not deter us from giving him 5 stars. We would absolutely recommend!"
30283317,518785731,2019-08-27,82152804,Dave,Sokol’s apartment is extremely clean and well maintained. It’s perfect for two people for a few nights. I would definitely recommend people stay there. The area near the apartment can feel a little sketchy at night but as long as your follow the directions Sokol provides you during check-in you’ll be fine.
30283317,520820047,2019-08-31,267550521,Дарья,Все очень понравилось!
30283317,524179389,2019-09-05,6818916,Caroline,Quiet <br/>Perfect for a couple

30283317,532083196,2019-09-19,236305655,Franziska,"Das Apartment war zwar klein, aber sehr sauber , ordentlich und völlig ausreichend. Die Lage war auch super, man konnte alles zu Fuß erreichen. Wir können das Appartement sehr gut weiterempfehlen."
30283317,535289229,2019-09-24,156074564,Fanni,"Well-located, clean, cozy, perfect for two people. Sokol is a great host. We got more than we expected. We were very satisfied with the flat and the view from the rooftop. Thanks again Sokol"
30283317,537172068,2019-09-28,102779270,Emily,"Sokol’s place was great for a one night stay. Close to the Monastiraki and Acropolis. The apartment building itself is beautiful and with great amenities, including the view of the Acropolis from the roof. However, the surrounding area appears a little run down but we didn’t have any problems."
30283317,537735420,2019-09-29,58285214,Jenna,Sokol's place was very modern and clean. It is close to the metro so not a far walk and there are also many restaurants close by.
30283317,538716570,2019-09-30,208806820,Natalie,Would highly recommend Sokol's place when stating in Athens. Great place in great location to all the attractions and restaurants.  Very clean and easy self check in.
30283317,539345262,2019-10-01,135847,Matthieu,Séjour d’une nuit dans ce petit studio suffisant pour 2 personnes et très bien aménagé et très bien équipé. Tout est en état quasi neuf.<br/>Procédure d'arrivée autonome bien faite et gros plus : possibilité de laisser ses bagages dans des casiers de l’immeuble avant le check-in et après le check-out.<br/>La localisation permet de faire tous les sites touristiques a pied.
30283317,542229894,2019-10-06,103645969,Sisi,Had a great stay. The check in was super easy and instructions very clear. I loved how nice the host was and kept checking up on us and even helped me get transportation. The apartment was newly renovated and beautiful. A little small but it's about the size of a European city hotel. Only complaint was the neighborhood is sketchy and I was scarred to walk there at nights. We took cabs or tried to get back before dark. But the door to the apt had huge locks so felt safe inside.
30283317,544806705,2019-10-11,275629382,Juliana,"Lindo apartamento, tudo muito limpo e aconchegante. Recomendo!"
30283317,547476422,2019-10-15,154310633,Laurie,"This apartment was not in a tourist area, but that's what we loved about it! The hosts were so gracious, with amazing communication. When we get to come back to Greece, we will be staying with them again!"
30283317,550617904,2019-10-19,64471575,Amanda,Thank you for everything! Super accommodating host and very clean place! <br/><br/>Thanks again!
30283317,554872669,2019-10-27,35528329,Júlia,"Ideal apartment if you want to visit Athens, comfortable and central. The arrival is easy and the communication super fast. I recommend this place. ;)"
30283317,556637909,2019-10-30,241586539,Emma,"Sokol’s place is very nice! All new furnishings and nice amenities including a gym in the building. There’s also a vending machine on site which we used very frequently for late night snacks! <br/><br/>At first the neighborhood seemed a little sketchy, but it really is close to everything in Athens! The hosts were extremely helpful and their recommendations were excellent. <br/><br/>I would recommend any of the rooms in this building to anyone staying in Athens! But I wouldn’t recommend this space for 2 people - it was pretty tight! But for the single traveler (or perhaps 2 small people) it would be perfect. I would definitely stay at this location again."
30283317,559936996,2019-11-05,101948365,Annick,"Great location, five minutes walk from lots of nice restaurants."

30283317,565220338,2019-11-17,3772847,Linda,This place is so clean and it’s close to everything we wanted to see. The neighborhood isn’t that great but we never felt unsafe... maybe when we first arrived there at night... but it was completely fine after that. Communication was great and they even offer lockers in case you arrive too early for check in or need to leave later after check out. The check in information is very detailed and we didn’t need to contact the hosts about anything but they would check in just to make sure everything was going well. This place was perfect for us!
30283317,566939424,2019-11-21,8594259,Angelo,The host was vey nice and always available. The place is cozy and very clean.

Self check-in is easy. Central location, close to restaurants and markets, easy to find and a great base for exploring all of Athens on foot. We really loved our stay there and will come again next time we visit the fantastic city of Athens. Thank you so much!"

30283317,585135402,2019-12-31,74491296,Φαιδρα,"The apartment is excellent for a short stay. It is really centrally located and close to everything. Sokol l, the host is really responsive and helpful. He provided us with several tips as well. In addition the place has lockers for leaving your stuff after checking out. The only drawback is that the street is quite dark and quite over the night, but we never really felt unsafe."
30283317,587618040,2020-01-03,160043048,Clement,Very clean apartment and building. Thank you Sokol for your reactivity and your availability.

30283317,591401090,2020-01-11,74564749,R Sri Ram,Location was very near all the tourist spots. Easy to get around. Clean room with sofa bed.

30283317,607078979,2020-02-17,126294306,Pawel,"We highly recommend this apartment  because it has everything you need to feel comfortable and happy with your stay in Athens. The apartment is well equipped, very clean and situated in the centre of the city, so you don't need to take public transport. At every moment, we  could count on the host. Thanks to his hospitality we had a great stay in the Greek capital."
30283317,611102698,2020-02-26,6935445,Frans,Het is een vrij nieuw appartement en alles ziet er goed uit. Alles wat je nodig hebt is aanwezig. Sokol reageert snel op berichten en hij geeft veel nuttige tips voor het verblijf in Athene. De straten in de directe omgeving zijn wat minder net maar een paar straten verderop is een van de gezellige buurten van Athene.
30283317,615551694,2020-03-08,37916415,Michael,"Sokol was assiduously attentive throughout, from first contact, ensuring all queries were rapidly responded to and offering helpful suggestions and valuable advice. Modern contemporary in style, the apartment is faithfully portrayed on the website and is exactly as seen there. Self check-in was easy and Sokol’s guide provided all information required. With the window open there can be a little background street noise but it disappears upon closing the sturdy window. It was quiet at night facilitating uninterrupted sleep. The accommodation was perfect whilst visiting wonderful Athens. Many of the major (and even not so major) sights are within comfortable walking distance. To take the metro, both Monastiraki and Omonia stations are just about half a km walk. KTEL Bus Stations A & B, for trips to Delphi, Nafplio and so on, are easily reachable from bus-stops close to the apartment. Sokol was a terrific host and on a return visit would without hesitation again request to stay in his attractive comfortable apartment."

30284619,366034579,2019-01-02,226670168,Karina,"Sokols apartment was very clean and had aeverything you may need for your stay in Athens, he always replied. The only thing that was a little bit unconveninent was the location, it is very close to the Acropolis and the touristic places but i is not very confortable to walk at night because there is not very much light in the streets. <br/><br/>We had a very good time in his apartment and I recomend it 100%."
30284619,366719401,2019-01-03,84199246,Heidi,"Lovely apartment, with everything you may need. Modern, clean and well positioned. Small interesting restaurants and eateries in the area."

Except that, everything was perfect, really beautiful appartement, nice view on the top. Great reactivity from Sokol."
30284619,404713605,2019-01-25,28930474,Hyun-Ae,Der Gastgeber Sokol und seine Frau sind sehr nette Personen. Die Wohnung ist sehr modern und sauber. Und die Lage ist auch bestens. Es war alles viel besser als wir eigentlich erwartet haben. Vielen herzlichen Dank für die Gastfreundschaft und für die gute Betreuung!

30284619,421275817,2019-03-09,150108943,Janouk,"Het appartement was perfect. Alles wat we nodig hadden was aanwezig en nieuw. Het was er brandschoon en wat een heerlijk bed! Na een lange dag met veel wandelen konden we even uitrusten op bed met netflix op de smarttv en genieten van de heerlijke (regen)douche. Enige nadeel is dat sommige straten rondom niet veilig waren/voelden voor twee jonge meiden. Taxichauffeur raadde ons af om door de Pakistaanse buurt naar het centrum te lopen, maar in plaats daarvan een straat om te lopen. Was een prima route en alsnog heel dichtbij!"
30284619,423116184,2019-03-13,230025745,Nikolay,"The accommodation itself is amazing and comfortable, as described. Sokol is great host, very responsive and helpful. <br/><br/>However, the neighborhood felt very unsafe - many deteriorated and abandoned buildings, graffiti all other the place, strange-looking people wondering around. It seems to be the case for the entire Monastiraki area but still - I wish I knew this in advance, either through property description or photos."
30284619,423452336,2019-03-14,42699580,Giorgos,Great choice! Strongly recommended!
30284619,431507972,2019-04-01,71238995,Sophie,"Great host, very responsive and wanting to make sure we had a comfortable stay. The apartment was great, filled with everything we needed. The apartment was within walking distances to most of Athens tourist attraction and about an 8 minute walk from the metro. The area felt a bit dodgy when walking in the evenings."
30284619,433311207,2019-04-06,137781171,Katha,"Very beautiful, well-equipped apartment, nice and caring host, perfect for a stay in Athens. Absolutely recommendable!"
30284619,433854977,2019-04-07,85801379,Serge,"Nous recommandons cet endroit, bien situé et très propres. Le propriétaire est de service et très disponible!"
30284619,436008331,2019-04-12,56796621,Xili,"Me and my mom stayed in Sokol’s apartment for 5 days. The apartment is 10 minutes away from Monastiraki Square. The apartment has everything you need for a few days in Athen (a equipped kitchen, amenities for bathroom, ironing stuff). Sokol is such a great guest, he asked us every day if we.re ok and if we need something. We didn.t meet him personally, because the apartment has a self check in. Because the weather was so bad the day we left, Sokol let us stay over check out times. The only bad thing about the apartment is the neighborhood, there are a few shady streets, but we hadn.t any issues. So, besides this, I totaly recommend the apartment and Sokol as a guest."
30284619,437717676,2019-04-15,92665042,Marta,"Apartamento impecable, el dueño encantador y detallista que nos guardó las maletas. <br/>El barrio está descuidado pero muy bien situado."
30284619,438698707,2019-04-17,55582286,Rebecca,Better than expected. Solok was very quick to respond. I didn't get to meet him but he was an amazing host.  My stay here was really comfortable and I would recommend.
30284619,439068656,2019-04-18,234023046,Karl,"The apartment is sparkling clean, and very stylish. Nice and clean place to stay in Athens. Great facilities including hair dryer, sewing kit, iron and iron board, coffee machine and portable shower head. Amazing hospitality with small gift and snacks. Location is convenient as it is closed to bus station. However, the neighborhood is also crowded with all kinds of people around because it is located near a local trading market. It is advice to be more careful at night."
30284619,440103493,2019-04-20,80539439,Karan,"Thanks for hosting us. It was really nice. Your friend was very nice too . he picked us from the airport, gave us few tips on the way and dropped us back to airport on our last day without any hassle. Central location, walking distance to Acropolis and other places. very clear instructions on check-in. <br/>My wife loved the small souvenir (key chain) and also the peanuts and welcome cookies were lovely. My daughter went crazy looking at the cookies. All in all, nice trip."
30284619,441527101,2019-04-22,213007363,Daniel,"Amazing hospitality, great value for money. Check-in was quick and easy, the apartment was super clean and just as nice as it looks in the photos. The location is perfect for sightseeing and nightlife - walking distance from major attractions like the acropolis and restaurant districts. Great view of the acropolis from the roof. Definitely would stay here again!"
30284619,442671450,2019-04-24,212694978,Claire,"Sokol was an amazing host and very helpful. He has several recommendations that were very useful. The apartment was modern and clean with many amenities. The door to the apartment had a double dead bolt lock. However, the apartment is located in a very unsafe part of town. Our taxi driver warned us not to walk the streets as she herself has had belongings stolen out of the car in the area. We also had a stranger come up to us as we were walking around and warn us to keep our wallets close to us. The area also is speculated to be a hot spot for trafficking. We did not know any of this until after we arrived. But if you plan on using a taxi to get around everywhere with little to no walking, you will be safe and the apartment is worth the price."
30284619,443528144,2019-04-26,7184002,Georgina,Great place to stay close to downtown Athens. Great host nice touches in the room. Host held our luggage after we checked out!
30284619,443946676,2019-04-27,212407730,Γιάννης,Great place to stay. It was all perfect. Strongly recommended!
30284619,444542991,2019-04-28,88828638,Pete,Sokols place is on the edge of the trendy area close to the main attractions. The view from the rooftop is amazing as described. <br/>Sokol was very helpful. We arrived early with bikes and luggage. He arranged for his cousin to meet us and our stuff was locked safe in a laundry cupboard until our formal check in time. We later met Sokol who was engaging and friendly. Highly recommended.
30284619,445333955,2019-04-29,95178601,D Raelyn,"From the very beginning, Sokol had great communication making everything very easy and smooth. His place has very nice upgrades and the bathroom was beautiful with rainfall shower head, very modern appearing. With about a 15 minute walk to syntagma square, you’ll have access to many shops, shopping center, and restaurants. Sokol was very hospitable and made me feel very welcomed. Thanks!"
30284619,446752789,2019-05-02,67192518,Kimberly,Very clean. Great location.  Thoughtful touches such as snacks and oranges waiting for us. The view from the rooftop dining area is beautiful. Sokol is prompt with answering messages.
30284619,450335928,2019-05-09,49745881,Daniela,"Comfortable and clean new apartment. Sokol was efficient with communication. Similar to other reviews, the neighbourhood felt unsafe however it was certainly close to all main attractions."
30284619,451697404,2019-05-12,37406009,Cathy,"Sokol's place is in a new building, very fancy and clean apartment. Sokol is quick with responses and even left us a little gift and snacks. The apartment is located central of the town, I was able to walk to most of the places."
30284619,453883559,2019-05-17,63044877,Rose,"Sokol’s place was a described and as shown in all the pictures. It is very clean and the host is very quick to respond to any issues and very friendly and accommodating. It’s a very central location about 7 minutes walk to Monastiraki and Omonia and about 18 minutes walk to the Athens main railway if you intend to travel to amazing Meteora. Although many reviews mention they feel unsafe, we never encounter any problems walking to and back from this apartment. I would recommend this beautiful apartment to anyone."
30284619,454873438,2019-05-19,80258027,Genevieve,"L’appartement est dans un immeuble impeccable tant au niveau de la propreté, du confort que de l’ambiance. <br/>L’entrée se fait de manière indépendante, ce qui est très facile et apprécié. <br/>Le quartier est habité par les locaux, profitez en pour apprendre, traverser 2 rues et vous serez dans le plus beau quartier de restaurant.<br/><br/>Pour les femmes, n’hésitez pas, les locaux sont gentils. Les rues sont moins touristiques et riches mais les gens sont d’une gentillesse incroyable! 2 min de marche à peine et vous serez dans un quartier rempli de restaurants, 3 minutes et vous serez dans le centre!"
30284619,457043925,2019-05-23,184513683,Kati,"We loved Sokol’s place. He thought of every detail. There were snacks, an ironing board, plenty of clean linens, detailed instructions for everything. We arrived at 0300 and he even arranged a taxi pickup for us. He was always available at a moment’s notice for any questions we had. Wonderful experience, we would stay here again in a heartbeat."
30284619,457390111,2019-05-24,121112138,Sofia,"Sokol’s studio, was very nice, clean and organised, the communication was very good and fast. We had a great stay overall. Thank you"
30284619,457942517,2019-05-25,3799919,Amanda,Beautiful apartment close distance to the Acropolis and some hip dining. Host was extremely kind and helped to arrange a cab for our very early flight.
30284619,462298872,2019-06-02,52670585,Will,This is a perfect place for a stay in Athens. It's a short and interesting walk to the main square and there and nice restaurants and places to drink nearby. The space is very comfortable and the shower and AC are great. The hosts were fantastic from start to finish. We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to Athens if we can.
30284619,466282593,2019-06-09,86256839,André,Great support from the host
30284619,467933976,2019-06-11,169439779,Lina,Beautiful flat in an amazing city ! <br/>Close to the centre and all the Sights.

30284619,471774766,2019-06-18,30029397,Milda,"Apartment is trully beautiful, everything is done to perfection even the small details. Super cozy place, we slept like babies. Aircon is helpfull  as well with Athens weather. Host was very helpfull  and gave some amazing tips what to do in Athens. Locations is pretty good because it is very close to acropolis and all the touristic objects but the neighbourhood is quite dodgy. Although it did not make our stay less enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who is planning to spend some time in Athens."
30284619,474515945,2019-06-23,229777799,Erica,"Wonderful space inside. The area the apartment is in did not seem to be the best, however it is close to the heart of the city, so that was convenient. Beautiful view from the top shared balcony."
30284619,476406247,2019-06-26,179826218,Sasha,"Our stay at Sokol’s place was fantastic!! Really clear check-in instructions which was helpful after a long flight and arriving at night. Sokol was always available to answer any queries we had. <br/><br/>Apartment was spotless and Sokol had included some great touches; water in the fridge, snacks. Location was perfect, so close to the Acropolis, metro and restaurants. The communal rooftop was beautiful - great view of the city. <br/><br/>10/10 great place to stay!"
30284619,476803343,2019-06-27,215077692,Miki,Extremely helpful host and super clean room. Would definitely stay again :)

30284619,480591974,2019-07-03,4269614,Loni,This apartment is highly recommendable! It is very new with so many lovely details and a really modern bathroom. Sokol is extremely responsive and very helpful! We would definitely come back!!!
30284619,486252164,2019-07-12,172053122,Emily,Sokol’s apartment was great. Everything was as described and was very neat and clean. Would stay there again!
30284619,488438651,2019-07-15,263819576,Victoria,"Sokol’s place was very clean and modern, and he was very kind over text. We weren’t there for long but the whole process was very easy. The location was great in terms of closeness to tourist attractions and public transportation, although we were warned by a taxi driver that it wasn’t the safest neighbourhood at night (which wasn’t really a problem for us). Overall great value and stay!"
30284619,489068130,2019-07-16,32335679,Amelia,Really good location  easy to communicate and checkin and checkout
30284619,490673215,2019-07-19,10475217,Morgan,"Modern, new and safe building. Lovely welcome gifts and all you need for a short stay. Area seems very local but took us a while to walk to the acropolis entry we wanted to go to but you could see it from the rooftop which was pretty magic. Follow Sokol's directions to go to the main sqaure, we didn't initially and realised very quickly why! Sokol was s helpful and accommodating, arranging a taxi with someone he knew and trusted and let us store our luggage after checkout and before our flight. He was an excellent host."
30284619,491315298,2019-07-20,153162400,Cath,Great location. 5 minutes from downtown and very close to acropolis. There is a terrace on the rooftop with a great view. Sokol respond very quickly and he is very helpful. We recommend this place.
30284619,493794083,2019-07-23,5836294,Jenny,"Sokol’s place was very convenient, as I had to buy a last minute accommodation for the night. He reached out right away and the self-check-in process was a breeze. It was also easy to take the metro nearby to the airport in the morning. I recommend staying in his place if you need a clean and comfortable stay in Athens!"
30284619,494388825,2019-07-24,251181296,Zane,Great apartment and an outstanding host. Will definitely stay again next time I’m in Athens. Thanks!
30284619,494959258,2019-07-25,171786932,Ella,Sokol’s place is a gorgeous little apartment in a great location in Athens. It’s just what you need for a short stay and perfect for a couple. Sparkling clean and little gifts left for us when we arrived! Especially lovely service from his friend who drove us around the city and offered lovely conversation and insight into the beautiful city we were in for an amazing price. Fantastic service and a fantastic airbnb choice!
30284619,496899030,2019-07-28,85340275,Karolina,"Sokol is such a kind person, always checking in. The place is fantastic, very new and clean and a beautiful place. I would stay there again. He left us a small souvenir and was very thoughtful during the whole stay, always answering any questions. Definitely pick to stay here!"
30284619,501129535,2019-08-03,44822812,Martina,"L’alloggio si trova in una posizione molto vicina ai principali luoghi di interesse e alle attività, nel quartiere etnico della capitale greca. Sokol è premuroso e disponibile e rintraccia i suoi ospiti in prima persona e quotidianamente per ogni evenienza. L’alloggio è perfettamente arredato e fornito di ogni confort. Lo consiglio!"
30284619,501787439,2019-08-04,53703192,Eduardo,"Beautiful apartment 10 minute walk from Monasteriki subway and all the ancient Greek attractions. Sokol was excellent with his communication and help with anything we needed. Would go back there. One note, if you are skittish about your surroundings, this may not be the place for you. The apartment is in a wholesale area of Athens and there are some unsavoury characters in every block. Not enough to feel unsafe but not the most comfortable feeling."
30284619,504205770,2019-08-07,40976384,Kat,"Sokol was a very helpful host and informed us accurately about l, check in, the apartment, the neighbourhood and things we could do. We found the apartment very convenient as it was located in a great spot ideal for exploring the city. It is in a central location so not very quiet at night but we didn’t mind that as it was where we wanted. A great stay, we found the apartment clean and equipped with everything we needed. thanks you Sokol!"

30284619,509785327,2019-08-15,64799136,Francesca,Sokol's space is completely brand new and very comfortable; the apartment is fully equipped and the roof terrace offers a truly unique view of Athens!!<br/>I would most definitely recommend this studio!
30284619,511308111,2019-08-17,184259374,Anissa,"Sokol’s place is beautiful! It’s very modern and well decorated. The bathroom is wow. Sokol was very kind and communicative. He even left us a little gift, which was so sweet! The view of the Acropolis is INCREDIBLE. The view at night took our breath away! <br/><br/>All this to say, I wouldn’t stay again because of the location. I am an experienced traveler and have lived downtown in a major city. When I read the reviews about the neighborhood, I thought the other guests were probably being dramatic. They weren’t. I was honestly afraid while walking around, even in broad daylight. People were yelling all night long, and we had a hard time sleeping. Sokol was a great host and his place is beautiful, so it’s a shame that we didn’t like our stay."

30284619,516968812,2019-08-25,57412035,David,"A compact ""studio"" type apartment that is well furnished, clean and comfortable. It is in a very secure building with an elevator. The unit is air-conditioned and modern and the WiFi works well. The neighborhood is quiet but some may take issue with the general appearance and upkeep of the nearby buildings and streets."
30284619,519242276,2019-08-28,272438549,Fei,Feel so comfortable in the apartment. The room is very clean and impressive.

30284619,525017903,2019-09-07,187453733,Miguel,"Very nice place to stay, with all the services you may need. The acommodation is a 10/10. However, it is in a dirty neighborhood but not unsafety, for my point of view."
30284619,527921292,2019-09-12,61744183,Johan,A nice place with a great interior design. The building is fine too. We didn't really use the terrace at the top but it's a plus. Sokol was a really attentionate guest. Not always the case on Airbnb.<br/>The Monastiriaki district near the appart is full of bars and restaurants (some great rooftops). Don't hesitate to go at the Filopappou hill for the sunset.
30284619,528392554,2019-09-13,90541215,Bashar,"The accommodation was very clean, nice touches, very good location, every things were available, by walking you ll be in plaka, the host Mr Sokol and his wife were very friendly, nice and kind persons, generous, do their best to help, I definitely recommend this accommodation and the hosts, hope that we ll be back soon"
30284619,531316081,2019-09-17,121340856,Karl,"Wir hatten das Appartment für mehrere Tage gebucht. Das Appartment war sehr sauber, modern und ansprechend eingerichtet und es war alles da, was das Herz begeht, sogar leckerer griechischer Kaffee und eine original Zubereitungs-Kanne. Sokol war ein supernetter, aufgeschlossener Gastgeber, die Kommunikation war sehr angenehm, wir bekamen bei Fragen immer sehr schnell Antwort und alles war zu unserer vollsten Zufriedenheit. Auch wir haben ein kleines Präsent erhalten, über das wir uns gefreut hatten. Super fanden wir auch die tolle Dusche, das bequeme Bett, die wirkungsvolle Klimaanlage und besonders die Dachterrasse mit der tollen Aussicht.In manchen Rezessionen war zu lesen, daß die Gegend unsicher ist und Gäste teilweise Angst hatten. Nun, unser Eindruck war der, daß wir schon mal die ein oder andere ""komische Gestalt"" gesehen haben, wir aber nie belästigt wurden. Es sind keine verlassenen Straßen, oft waren auch andere Touristen oder Einheimische unterwegs. Wir haben uns nicht unsicher gefühlt. (Im übrigen sieht man auch an allen anderen Plätzen / Straßen immer wieder Obdachlose, Bettler und auch ""komische Gestalten""). Großer Pluspunkt: die Lage ist sehr zentral, man geht 10 Minuten bis zum MONASTIRAKI SQARE / Metro Station und am IROON SQUARE (PSIRI) ist man bereits in unter 5 Minuten. Hier gibt es viele schöne Tavernen, in denen man sehr lecker essen kann und die Ecke ist auch touristisch nicht so überlaufen wie Plaka. <br/>Wir hatten hier eine schöne Zeit und würden jederzeit auch wieder hier übernachten."
30284619,533784795,2019-09-22,220697768,Priya,"The host tried to charge us 100 euros for some towels and sheets we didn’t even use. Apparently it was very dirty. Accused us of using 3 towels and 3 bed sheets. But no we only used 2 towels and 1 sheet. In anyway trying to steal 100 euros from us for using 3 towels and 3 bedsheets as he claimed fraudulently is just too much. If the towels and sheets were what he acted about, I offered to buy and send it to him but never heard back. <br/><br/>Be very wary of staying here. Probably just don’t if you don’t wnat to be charged 100 euros for making some towels dirty by using it. <br/><br/>The flat is very good inside but the area is very bad. We literally witnessed druggies outside our flat injecting themselves. Walking down the streets in that area is very unsafe. Maybe taxi is okay."
30284619,535341041,2019-09-24,61553190,Per Eirik,"Just what you expect. Really nice, clean and practical apartment, with a very nice rooftop. The apartment was a really good base from where we could explore Athens."
30284619,536569968,2019-09-27,96209497,Gricelis,"The apartment building is very secure, clean and welcoming. The hosts are great and go beyond to make sure you are comfortable at their place."
30284619,537844169,2019-09-29,23646764,Debbie,Very helpful Owner. Will give all the direction and tips In Athens. Check in information was clear and can keep your baggage in locker.<br/><br/>Apartment was safe and clean. <br/>Thank you Sokol for all information. We have a pleasant experience in Athens. <br/><br/>Walked acropolis approximately 15min. Convenient. Make sure walk the right street towards monastiraki Square. Near by have wholesale shops and homeless people surrounding the apartment. Can ask Sokol.<br/><br/>Top floor you can enjoy the views of Acropolis ;)
30284619,543090919,2019-10-07,148484624,Anthony,The flat and building is very smart and new with fabulous views from the roof terrace. It is also very near the Acropolis and Plaka area. The hosts were very helpful and considerate and the flat itself was a joy to stay at.
30284619,545390364,2019-10-12,12851926,Melissa,"Hosts are very communicative, providing many suggestions and help during your stay. The location is perfect for navigating to the major sites in the city, but the immediate surrounding neighborhood is not the cleanest, so heads up for those who care about stuff like that. Always felt safe though and liked being able to walk most of the places we wanted to go. I'd recommend this place."
30284619,547427329,2019-10-15,43023982,Erneisha,"Don’t judge a book by its cover!!!! <br/><br/>The apartment was excellent. Exactly as pictured. Shower was amazing!!! Host were great once we arrived! <br/><br/>Now.... I had a bite of a communication issue initially with the host. A week before we left I reached out to get information abt ferries to Santorini and didn’t hear from the until 2 days before hand. By that point I had already booked a flight. Additionally, I was t sent the check in information until the day of and by that time I had no service/wifi. That was really frustrating as walking around the packing district with luggage and having flown 12 hours was tiring to say the least. I was finally able to reach Harry and he quickly melted that frustration away. He was able to show me the link with the check in info as well as personally showed us all the bells and whistles of the apartment. And the View!!!!! <br/><br/>It is located in the packing district as mentioned before. It’s a little sketch but just mustard through. We walked from the city center at night and encountered a heckler but we were fine. Just make sure you are aware of your surroundings. <br/><br/>We only stayed a night as we had an early morning to get to Santorini. It’s pretty close to everything nothing is more than a 10 mins walk (food and metro). This place will not disappoint. Also, the hosts assisted me in getting a 4am taxi to the airport. Much appreciated."
30284619,554404494,2019-10-26,43181934,Ubirajara,"O espaço é tal e qual descrito pelos anfitriões, cujas competência, prestatividade e simpatia foram, em minha experiência, sempre excelentes. O entorno urbano do apartamento, contudo, é infelizmente algo caótico, um pouco abandonado e decididamente sujo. Embora assim, não experimentei nenhuma dificuldade ou constrangimento ao caminhar pelas ruas próximas ao apartamento. A minha conclusão é de que vale a pena hospedar-se em tal apartamento, e de que, numa outra oportunidade, eu consideraria de bem perto a possibilidade de nele permanecer outra vez."
30284619,555894142,2019-10-28,208291091,Steven,"I really wanted to leave this place a good review, but couldn’t do it with a good conscience and have other travels be as surprised as we were. <br/><br/>The facilities are clean, have plenty ammenities, and comfortable. We loved the actual room. The staff was very communicative and tried their best to do everything they could for us. <br/><br/>Our issues are that the hotel isn’t being upfront with travelers and it seems like the owner goes out of his way to hide a few things from the public. 1. The Acropolis sits behind this building, not in front of it. The patio and sitting areas actually face away from it besides two seats and a small window in a designated area separate from the patio. This makes the listing misleading. 2. The area outside of the hotel seems very unsafe. There are plenty of reports of crime and we witness multiple people shooting heroin right outside our door. We were also offered drugs almost every night while walking in and out. The neighborhood is extremely noisy because of this and there were several fights outside at night while we stayed as well."
30284619,556695771,2019-10-30,38508747,Thamasha,"This was one of the best air bnb experiences I've had. The communication from the host was always very quick, clear and helpful. The appartment is well located very close to the main attractions in Greece and was immaculate. In addition to being very clean the appartment also had some thoughtful touches like treats when we arrived (much appreciated after a late flight) and a very clear, easy to follow self check in guide. There's a few comments in the reviews about the area being unsafe but as two young female travellers we did not have any issues with the area around the appartment and if we were arriving back late we just ordered a car through a rideshare app (very cheap to get from most places since the appartment is so central anyway). Standout was definitely the hospitality - my friend had to stay back in Athens for a couple of nights and as soon as I told our host Marilena she went above and beyond to help find another accommodation for her. It was much appreciated and I could not recommend the hosts or the appartment enough!"
30284619,558478338,2019-11-03,52612905,Reme,"El apartamento es tal cual la foto o mejor si cabe. Tiene todo lo que puedas necesitar, una buena cama, un baño con una dicha genial y una cocina que cumple a la perfeccion. Cuando llegamos teniamos muchos detalles de bienvenida, cacahuetes, pastelitos, incluso un regalo""un pin"". Hemos estado de lujo, por ponerle un pero la zona pese a que esta a unos 20 minutos andando de la Acropolis y su cercania esta muy bien ya que puedes aparcar el coche ya que en la calle se puede aparcar, da un poco de miedo ya que es un poco marginal. Pero de todas maneras como ahi no estás en todo el dia, repetiria sin dudarlo.decir que el anfitrion estuvo muy pendiente de nosotros en todo momento  y atento a cualquier consulta. Incluso hay smartv donde pudimos ver Netflix."

Εξαιρετική οργάνωση που φαίνεται από τις υποδομές του κτηρίου (γυμναστήριο, αποθηκευτικό χώρος αποσκευών) μέχρι και το κάθε διαμέρισμα. Δεν υπάρχει απολύτως κανένα ελάττωμα. Το μόνο αρνητικό είναι η τοποθεσία, για την οποία φυσικά δεν ευθύνονται οι οικοδεσπότες και με λίγη προσοχή μπορεί εύκολα να ξεπεραστεί μπροστά στην ομορφιά του χώρου. Ευχαριστούμε πολύ για την εξαιρετική Φιλοξενία!"
30284619,564646025,2019-11-16,243035534,Cassandra,"Was very disappointed with the experience of staying here. The apartment is lovely, was a bit smelly in the bathroom wish due to being small filtered out everywhere but clean and presented well. The welcome gift was a nice touch too however the listing is very misleading as you can not see the acropolis from the main balcony and the area is very unsafe. The hosts will say we have never had any issues with safety and all our tourists have been safe but Im not sure anyone would feel safe walking around the neighbourhood at night. There is a welfare/empoverished health centre on the corner and scores of refugees and gang like groups handing on every corner. The walk home from dinner before we realised this was the scariest of my life. There is lots of druggos and people hassling you asking you if you want drugs and it is not somewhere I would recommend. On top of this the host was a tight arse and I was penalised 50% for the remaining 3 days even though I cancelled the night we arrived and felt the misleading information about the area was reason to receive a refund for the days not stayed. Not sure how they got the super host status??"
30284619,566942312,2019-11-21,291050407,Pam,"Amazing place to stay if you're visiting Athens. The host checked on us a few times asking if we needed anything. We got some great tips from the checkinguide about the safest way to get to the center of Athens.<br/>Though the place and the hosts were amazing, the apartment is located in a busy street. Unfortunately there are a lot of strange alleys with loads of people."
30284619,572181475,2019-12-02,155220093,Cynthia,"Sokol’s place was beautiful - bright and airy with a gorgeous bathroom and small eat-in kitchen. They provided simple amenities and had free wi-fi which is always a plus. <br/><br/>Sokol was really responsive - any question we had or anything we needed he was fast to respond and provide (if needed). <br/><br/>The view from the top of the building of the Parthenon and then of the city on the other side was breathtaking - definitely worth staying here for that. <br/><br/>A note about the location: while it’s very centrally located, it’s next to a drug spot in town. We personally didn’t have any issues (thank goodness) but did witness a few unsavory things on the same block. Not a place to start solo."
30284619,575091464,2019-12-09,141014334,Humberto,"Sokol’s place was excellent and I highly recommend if you are traveling to Greece. His place is super clean and near all of the main attractions. I felt like I was at home. If you have any questions, Sokol responds quickly and makes it easy to have a good experience during your stay. I will definitely go back in the future."
30284619,581563658,2019-12-25,160151495,Julia,"Sokol’s place is beautiful and clean! The stay itself was comfortable and had everything we needed. Sokol even left some treats and goodies.<br/><br/>However, the room we were in had the heater control for the building and Sokol came to our room with no warning to fix it for some other guests. <br/><br/>The location was a bit further from attractions than I thought. It had some unsavoury characters in the neighbourhood and an unsettling poster hung on a nearby building within our view. <br/><br/>Overall the place itself is beautiful and Sokol’s attention to detail is great. There were just other factors that took the overall experience down a notch."

The apartment inside was adorable, with the basic amenities you would need. <br/><br/>My only qualm is that the AirBnB was in a not-so-safe part of town. Our taxi driver warned us about the crime that goes on in the neighborhood, and urged us not to stay out much after dark. <br/><br/>All in all, we much enjoyed our time at Sokol’s place. The value for money was great!"

Communication was also top, no problem whatsoever with the checkin, checkout and anything else throughout our stay. <br/><br/>On the other side, I was quite surprised about the location. The neighborhood is very dirty and quite shady. I would not advice a woman to travel alone in this area, especially after dark. I know Sokol can not solve this in anyway, except advising his guests what streets they shouldn't be walking (which he did), but either way people should be aware before booking."

The location was outstanding, close to all the main places you would want to see in the city and close to the Metro station. Yes the street is a little bit shady but, it shows you the city the way she is and expose you to the real ppl of the city, so in my opinion it's a plus. Very good communication with sokol answered our questions  and helped us when we needed to delay our checkout. Overall Sokol gave us a sence of a good proffessional and caring hosting from the beginning till the end!"

There are nobody near you just you and the views to acropolis and the city. The bed is very comfortable and big. Little kitchen has everything you need, living room is also comfortable (but we were not sitting there much). Location is also great. Most of the places are in easy walking distance (popular LUKUMADES place is few minutes of walking, Κώστα - probably best souvlaki in Athens is also few minutes away, even acropolis is about 10-15 with no rush. Grocery store is 4-5min away). Overall the place was even better than we expected. Matilda is more than welcoming,she is an amazing person who helped us in different situations. Quick responses,recommendations and anything we needed she helped us as much as she could. Best recommendations! If we will come back to Athens - will not even think about any other place.

It is centrally located:  20 min. walk to Acropolis, 5 min. to City Market, 15 min. to Zeus and National Gardens and surrounded by shops and restaurants. The building itself is a bit tired and dirty, but the apartment is great. And the view!! Wow! We spent most of our time on the patio where you are surrounded by panoramic views of Athens. Grab a bottle of wine and celebrate the setting sun. The apartment isn't chic, but it's everything you need to make your stay in Athens memorable."

The advantage is that it is less than 20 minutes from all the places to visit, it's a good point.<br/>Athens itself is not a beautiful city, but the historical sites, museums and good restaurants are worth a visit."
30285410,493873262,2019-07-23,205069886,Mae-Lin,The host was extremely flexible and willing to work with our early check out time. The host provided details of how to get to the apartment via public transportation which made us feel comfortable for our first time in Greece. The apartment has a lovely view of the Acropolis and is within walking distance to the historical sites.  We definitely recommend staying here.
30285410,495423785,2019-07-26,45057717,Quentin,"Perfect location, GREAT terrace with view on the acropole -perfect to rest after the day and have a drink. Perfect communication too! I strongly recommend it!"
30285410,499798989,2019-08-01,145009130,Amanda,Konstantinos and Matilda were fabulous hosts! They accommodated our 1:00am check in and even met us at the nearby bus stop. Matilda gave us many suggestions for nearby food and attractions. The apartment has everything you need. The location is great and the view is absolutely amazing!! Watching the sunset with a view of the Acropolis and a bottle of wine was the perfect way to end our trip!
30285410,514533772,2019-08-21,38017633,Audrey,Perfect for our needs. Amazing view of the Acrpolis.
30285410,515654432,2019-08-23,1155265,Mikey,"Amazing view, centrally located, really helpful communicating and gettin it all set, absolutely great. Thank you!"
30285410,517013511,2019-08-25,186748759,Nadim,Our stay was very good and the apartment is very nice with a breathtaking view.<br/>Only we found the entrance to the building is a little bit weird.<br/>We will stay here again for sure
30285410,518792634,2019-08-27,24115128,Melanie,"This was a great place to stay in Athens! The location was close to all of the sites, easy to walk to the Acropolis, Temple of Zeus, etc. Less than a 10 min walk to the metro station. The building is a bit strange and deserted at night but that view is worth it! It was the most amazing view of the Acropolis and worth the money. The apartment is simple but has everything you would need, they even have a first aid kit.  Check in was great, we were met early so we could leave our luggage and shown some of the great places to eat nearby. I highly recommend this place in Athens!"
30285410,525898326,2019-09-08,24086235,Brad,This space is better than expected.  Such a great view that we had trouble leaving to enjoy the city at night.  Happy to have found it and we'll return for sure.
30285410,527112931,2019-09-10,115783094,Clair,"Super location, accurate description of the apartment and great communication! Perfect place to stay in Athens!"
30285410,528391734,2019-09-13,274317725,Laura,"Great location! Tons of restaurants and markets in easy walking distance. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and had an AMAZING view. We spent every evening on the HUGE private deck looking over the the almost 360 degree city views and unobstructed view of the Acropolis. Simply unbeatable."
30285410,531317490,2019-09-17,7837832,Alex,The place is really great for it's amazing terrace (as seen in pics) and the location in a bustling and vibrant neighborhood. Super close to anything you might need. Check in was very easy and hosts were very responsive and available. They also provided lots of additional tips and info to help make out stay a pleasant one. I would definitely recommend to anyone for their athens stay. The sunsets we enjoyed on the rooftop were absolutely spectacular!
30285410,533148240,2019-09-21,13813906,Alex,"Unique Airbnb for the experienced traveler. You have private access to a huge roof with unparalleled views of the Acropolis and a large swath of Athens. However, you should be aware that you’ll be staying in what is essentially a converted storage shed on top of a commercial building. No one else lives there so entering at night (electric roll up gate, dark hallways and elevator) is not for the faint of heart. If you live in a large, charmingly decrepit urban area like Brooklyn, East Berlin, Budapest, etc. you’ll probably love this Airbnb (we did). If large, empty, sometimes dark urban spaces creep you out, find another place to stay."
30285410,534780142,2019-09-23,56838037,Karen,"We loved our weekend at this apartment. The area is bustling with activity, the apartment is clean and well situated (albeit a little hard to find!), and the view from the rooftop terrace is nothing short of spectacular.  Highly recommend!"
30285410,538850821,2019-09-30,38867316,Bjørnar,"Great place in a great location, for my purposes. Good communication with the host.<br/>Amazing roof top area for tanning and relaxing, if you're in that sort of mode. Very nice to relax on the bed, with the door open, looking at Acropolis."
30285410,543090796,2019-10-07,246829341,Liam,Excellent setting right in the heart of the city. View from the rooftop is spectacular and exactly as pictured. Matilda was very responsive and extremely knowledgeable. Would most definitely stay again.
30285410,553092539,2019-10-23,17911410,Arthur,Unique terrasse with gorgeous view that makes your stay in this apartment very enjoyable. Reactive communication and good organisation: you can’t go wrong by staying at Konstandinos!
30285410,584587268,2019-12-30,39050329,Christoph,"Dear Konstandinos, <br/>Dear Matilda<br/><br/>Thank you for everything all your recommendations were amazing. Warm, Clean, great location and fabulous unique view. We will certainly come back in our next vacations.<br/><br/>Regards and Xronia Polla"
30285410,587466140,2020-01-03,898449,Maximilian,Amazing rooftop. Huge and best view of the city. <br/><br/>Super fast in responding and always checking on us whether we needed something without being annoying. <br/><br/>Great experience.
30285410,603320684,2020-02-09,199724082,Annabelle,"WOW! The views are absolutely amazing and the outside space has everything you need. Sunbeds, sofa and table & chairs. The bedroom is lovely and stylish as well as the living room/kitchen. The kitchen is very simple. Ok to cook a quick breakfast but that’s about it.  <br/><br/>The apartment is literally surrounded by everything you need! 1 minute from Ermou and a short walk to Monastiraki. <br/><br/>Konstantinos’ sister and girlfriend were great hosts! Quick in responding and efficient. All in all, completely worth it and good price."
30285410,609687556,2020-02-23,37873176,Owen,"Located on top of a shopping complex, which means the rooftop terrace is approx 3x the size of the apartment. Good view of the Acropolis and you can see the water. Nice sunsets too."
30285410,615459589,2020-03-08,340140600,Sofia,"Great view, privacy and really convenient location!"
30285410,633497732,2020-06-30,43101719,Triantafyllia,"We are thankful for choosing  Antonis' apartment as our stay was convenient, clean and enjoyable. The apartment is excellent, modern, cosy and comfortable! It was very clean, well decorated and had all the amenities! The view is stunning!  You can see Acropolis from the huge private terrace!! We did not go out at night just  wanted to sit in the comfortable sofa to drink something watching the Acropolis and Athens by night. It was amazing!!!! Its location is excellent, in the city center,  in a peaceful neighborhood, where everything is close! Antonis is a very good host, friendly and helpful and he had the willing to help us to be comfortable in his house and solve all the problem that we faced. I highly recommend this apartment!! Now, we have a nice place to stay when we visit  Athens again!! We loved the view, the apartment, the location and the hosts were great! It is value for money!! The perfect choice!"
30285410,635333940,2020-07-06,8921532,Vasileios,"A comfortable, well-equipped apartment in a very central location, which is bustling during the day and quiet at night. The rooftop terrace has an extraordinary view of the Acropolis. Given that the apartment is on the top floor, it can get very hot (to be expected in Athens!), but luckily the bedroom is air-conditioned. The communication with the hosts was excellent!"
30285410,638946385,2020-07-17,34169000,Julien,"Très bon séjour en couple dans cet appartement à Athènes. Bien situé. Nous avons tout fait à pieds sauf le musée archéologique en métro. L'appartement est bien équipé. Clim. Grand lit. Cuisine avec le nécessaire pour cuisiner simplement. Le must du logement c est la terasse. La vue est incroyable. Transats et table pour bronzer, lire, apéro etc. ! Vraiment top ! Thank you Konstandinos !"
30285410,645523474,2020-08-02,35796064,Francisco,"Best view of the Acropolis in Athens (and I mean it), rooftop is even bigger than what it looks like in the pictures! District is really great, many bars, restaurants, coffeeshops, and close to everything. Contrarily to what I could read in some comments, there are people living in the building and the entrance isn't that scary (just a big garage door to be opened with a remote control).<br/>Only negative points : the umbrella on the rooftop was broken (but was probably replaced after our departure) and air conditioning is only in the bedroom.<br/>In the overall we loved to stay in this amazing rooftop and Konstantinos was really reactive in the communication :)"
30285410,646914382,2020-08-05,175603950,Arnauld,"Matilda and Konstandinos are very nice and reactive so everything was perfect with our arrival and departure. The apartment is great and well situated, right in the city center, close to Monastiraki station. It may be surprising at the first glance because it is located on the rooftop of a commercial building, but it’s clean, very quiet and we have this huge rooftop for us alone, with a breathtaking view on Acropolis and Athens (almost 360°) ! I highly recommend this place for a very fun, quite romantic and beautiful experience !"
30285410,654194337,2020-08-21,99074888,Verónica,"Great location, amazing rooftop and super helpful host. If you go to Athens don’t hesitate to book this Airbnb, you will not be disappointed!"
30285410,660050049,2020-09-04,346688464,Joana,The apartment is great and has a great location. The best is the view and all that space in the terrace. We loved it.
30285410,664998200,2020-09-17,64011309,Julie,"Our stay was great thanks to our host who was really hepfull and communicative. The place was great, really clen and perfect location! and the terrasse view is just wonderfull!!!"

30285410,671465313,2020-10-05,1285203,Malte,The place is amazing: The view from the huge roof terrace tops everything! The location is perfect - next to all the nice bars and restaurant but so secluded that it is super quiet. The place itself is small but very cozy and spotlessly clean. The host takes care of your every need. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
30285410,672503247,2020-10-09,226080054,Conor,"Both Matilda and Konstandinos were very accommodating as our flights weren't at the best of times.  The views from the massive roof terrace are amazing, it made our trip that much better!"

30285410,704091135,2020-10-26,41031106,Bradley,"Super great rooftop balcony and view. Amazing central location. Wasn't quite what I expecting initially but definitely settled in and  felt like a local for a few days. Matilda's communication was effecient and the place was very clean. No need for a car at this location, walking and Uber/taxi best options."
30285410,758220070,2021-05-15,2323753,Nicholas,"What a great great great place! Perfect for a couple or a solo traveler - yes its a commerical building so unconventional entrance (garage door) but safe, quiet and private with amazing huge terrace and outdoor shower in front of the Acropolis."
30285410,760068002,2021-05-19,37055746,Alyssa,Great location and the view from the terrace is AMAZING. Hosts met us at the apartment and were super responsive and helpful. I felt like it was a really good deal for the central location. The only strange thing (which was never an issue really) is that it is located on the top of a commercial center which is a bit like a little mall. The other floors don't seem residential but I could be wrong about that.  buildings? It's just a little strange to get in and out of the building but it didn't affect our stay in any way.  I will say though that after hours (you are given a garage key to open the entrance of the shopping center after hours) when all the shops are closed and it is dark it is a little creepy to be by yourself! That being said though I did enjoy my stay and would recommend this property.
30285410,763650774,2021-05-29,1119090,Alexandrine,"L’appartement parfait ! La vue sur l’Acropole est extraordinaire. Le rooftop est titanesque. Matilda est une hôte merveilleuse. Elle m’a aidé pour trouver ce que voulais acheter et les tests PCR. L’appartement situé au dernier étage d’un immeuble est bien au calme. Si vous voulez profiter d’une vue imprenable sur l’Acropole c’est l’appartement qu’il vous faut ! Si je peux, j’y retournerai !"
30285410,765265231,2021-06-01,171191814,Tessa,"I had the most excellent stay here! Wonderful location and in walking distance to practically everything. The balcony area is huge and can not be beat. The host was very attentive and made sure to answer all of my questions. And as a solo traveler, I had a lot! The cleanliness of the room was a 10/10 and everything I could possibly need was accessible in the room. I would highly recommend anyone coming to Athens to stay here. I will definitely be booking again in the future!"
30285410,766947153,2021-06-06,19818124,Marsilla,Highly recommended accomodation with the feeling of having some calm holiday space in the middle of the high crowded places in Athens. View directly to the acropolis from the bed (but you might take more care of the moscitos :) . Matilda was a very friendly host with an excellent service for any questions!

30285410,406907483626829708,2021-07-15,201112898,Jennifer,The host at this establishment English is OK salute Lee superb. Her attention to detail to make sure that you feel welcome and not only in her country but also in the apartment. If you are lost if you need suggestions around town if you need anything at all her and her family will come and take care of you. This is already my far  location increase of my time here and by far they are better than anyone else

Das Gebäude war sehr alt und sehr creepy, vor allem für eine Frau. Die Wohnung sah nicht wie auf der Photos aus, sauber war auch nicht wirklich. <br/><br/>Die Terrasse war voll mit alten Schrott und sehr dreckig. Also eine komplette andere Wohnung als auf dem Photo. <br/><br/>Am Abend saßen wir mit paar Freunde auf der Terrasse, bis der Vermieter mit seiner Schwester kam vorbei ohne davor anzurufen oder uns Bescheid  zu geben, dass wir vllt laut waren oder jemand sich beschwert hat. Die standen einfach vor unsere Tür.<br/><br/>Die haben uns terrorisiert, uns beleidigt und sie wollten uns rausschmeißen. <br/><br/>Die Schwester hat geschrien und uns beleidigt, hat gesagt : „Das ist meine Wohnung und ich darf machen was ich will.“ <br/><br/>Die haben so laut geschrien, dass man nur die Stimme von der Schwester gehört hast. Wir waren alle schockiert. <br/><br/>So unfreundlicher unverschämter und frecher Gastgeber hab ich niemals erlebt. <br/><br/>Die Wohnung ist für diese Preisleistung NICHT WERT und das Haus generell ist super creepy und nicht schön. <br/><br/>Der Gastgeber macht die ganze Erfahrung schlechter. <br/><br/>Keine Gastfreundschaft und keine Kommunikation nur Geschrei. Richtig traurig."
30285410,411273151300430678,2021-07-21,84842964,Guillaume,"Terrasse géante avec vue vraiment incroyable et possibilité de s’y doucher devant l’Acropole, ce qui n’a pas de prix . L’appartement est impeccable, le lit gigantesque et l’emplacement idéal. La climatisation dans la chambre est bienvenue et indispensable.<br/>Entrée très originale. Merci encore Matilda pour l’accueil, les gentilles attentions et vos très bons conseils."
30285410,414168126909852773,2021-07-25,206940983,Laynie,"The view alone makes this place worth every penny!! On top of the private balcony with Acropolis view, the place was also immaculately clean, the host was responsive and made great suggestions, and the check-in/check-out process was seamless. 10/10 would recommend anyone to stay here!!!"

30285410,419258584331908613,2021-08-01,30732010,Eve,"A hidden gem in the heart of Athens! Very quiet but close to many bars, restaurants and shops. Highlights include the incredible rooftop terrace, the large comfortable bed and air conditioning in the bedroom - although it was a shame this didn’t extend to the living room too. I would agree with previous comments that the entrance to the apartment is a bit strange, through a run-down shopping mall/office block, but Matilda’s instructions were very helpful and clear which meant I had no problems checking in and we got used to it."

Konstandinos and Matilda have a beautiful, clean, wonderfully located apartment with a private rooftop terrace and world class view of the Acropolis. The apartment has everything you need, including coffee, tea, a hairdryer, toiletries, and more. It’s a little difficult to find because the building is accessible via a hallway tucked between commercial shops, but Matilda provides great directions and makes sure that you are taken care of. Five minutes walking from shops, restaurants, and any tours you may do. It’s really the best home base to have while you’re in Athens."

Konstandinos' place offers a spectacular view of the Acropolis from a spacious private rooftop terrace. The apartment is modern and well furnished with everything you need to enjoy your stay. The cherry on top has to be the outdoor shower on the terrace, which is perfect for washing off the sweat and cooling down after adventures in the city. The neighborhood is lively, close to all major sites and with great gastronomy nearby.  Konstandinos is a thoughtful host, very communicative and easy to reach. This one is a no-brainer: book it!"

We loved the details so much! The huge bed is really comfy and you can even see the Acropolis from there!<br/>We also loved the way to get inside the building at night as you will see as well.<br/>Also it's located there where you want to be, in the heart of Athens. And you won't hear all the noise of the million bars as you are on top of the city.<br/>Absolutely recommended!"

30285774,354666679,2018-12-02,35945134,Γιώργος,Θα ήθελα να ευχαριστήσω τον οικοδεσπότη γιατί πραγματικά δεν περίμενα τέτοια εξυπηρέτηση ηταν απίστευτη διαμονή θα ξαναμεινουμε σίγουρα και σύντομα ευχαριστούμε .
30285774,360901606,2018-12-22,9728664,Whitney,"This place is very clean and well outfitted, luxurious even. It is on the outskirts of the very cool Monstariki neighborhood and walkable to all of central Athens including the historical monuments. The hosts were very kind and available, definitely recommend."
30285774,362806904,2018-12-27,99144974,Mara,"We booked Sokol’s apartment very last minute because we did not make it to our next destination in time. First off, #1 shower in Athens. Amazing beds, brand-newly renovated, convenient location, and best bang for your buck! It was a great value, and he was so nice to find the iPad that I left behind. We will be back!"

30285774,368120146,2019-01-06,163786428,Tommaso,"Eccellente, l’unico aggettivo per poter descrivere la qualità del soggiorno offerto da Sokol.<br/>Massima cordialità e disponibilità dell’host, una struttura moderna, curata nei particolari, caratterizzata da una estrema pulizia e funzionalità di tutti gli ambienti."
30285774,402346312,2019-01-18,232690992,Grzegorz,A very comfortable flat.
30285774,404224588,2019-01-23,196721698,Spyros,"Καθαρό και ωραίο διαμέρισμα στο κέντρο της Αθήνας. Πολύ κοντά σε όλα. Πολύ καλή φιλοξενία και επικοινωνία. Το μόνο αρνητικό είναι η περιοχή, η οποία χρίζει προσοχής ειδικά τις βραδινές ώρες λόγω των αστέγων."
30285774,405527896,2019-01-27,42500927,Alexandra,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt bei Sokol. Die Wohnung ist sehr schön, sauber und zentral gelegen. Sokol ist ein super freundlicher Host. Einmal am Abend hatten wir kein warmes Wasser, der Host ist sehr schnell vorbei gekommen und hat Problem gelöst - der Schalter befindet sich in der Nachbarwohnung und wurde von den Nachbarn versehentlich ausgeschaltet. In Summe ein gutes Erlebnis."
30285774,408331297,2019-02-04,65101434,Avgoustinos,"Very clean and beautiful appartment. Comfortable couch and bed. Hot water in the bath at any given time. The finishing touches, like a small souvenir, or the extra sheets etc were a plus. The host was very helpful and willing to help. As for the value, you cannot find anything like this quality for this price in that area."
30285774,413782280,2019-02-18,195765460,승섭,"There are a lot of homeless people near our apartment and the road is a little dark. But, never mind. The apartment is fantastic! I'm sure that I will visit this apartment again if I come back to Athens."
30285774,414304396,2019-02-19,199983916,Arina,"Квартира замечательная, чистота на высшем уровне. Много продуманных мелочей, таких как чай, печеньки, вода в холодильнике, много полотенец. Отдельное спасибо, за возможность оставить до вечера чемоданы, с учётом раннего выезда. Хозяин отвечает очень быстро ( помог решить проблемы) и в случае отсутствия интернета у вас, может позвонить. Единственный минус, это район. Омония, достаточно неприятный район и двух одиноким девушкам вечером страшно там ходить, но попадая в квартиру вы забываете про то где находитесь."
30285774,415663068,2019-02-23,195765460,승섭,It is the best house in Athina.
30285774,417147209,2019-02-26,75424782,Šimon,"The Sokol is so friendly. He helped us in every time. The apartment was clean, silent and good for romantic times. I recommend Sokol’s servise."
30285774,418979239,2019-03-03,142065963,Eszter,"Very clean, nice, comfy flat. If I come to Athen any time in the future, I choose this flat."
30285774,424213281,2019-03-16,87530866,Sheila,We would highly recommend this airbnb. Sokol was a considerate host keeping in touch and responding quickly to questions. He arranged for a taxi to pick us up at the airport and to take us back again at the end of our stay. The apartment was roomy and well equipped  and very clean. Our only other comment is that we would not recommend this location for a single woman. Day and night the streets  are full of single young men and this could be a little concerning.
30285774,425819949,2019-03-19,140628517,Melissa,We enjoyed our stay at Sokol’s apartment and the quick responses and tips!
30285774,426509636,2019-03-21,9920767,Weibin,"Sokol was very accommodating of our request for early check-in and he sent help immediately over to the apartment when we had problems getting the heater to work. The apartment was lovely, spacious and clean. It is a 10 min walk from the station though the building was a little hard to locate at first."
30285774,428510020,2019-03-25,80335766,Jonathan,"Sokols place is a fantastic value, that is very safe and beautifully designed. the check-in process is very easy and the host provided good recommendations for which streets to take walking to the airbnb. he is always a text away for food recommendations and the upper terrace is unbelievable.  wonderful value, wonderful home."
30285774,429870717,2019-03-29,16525364,Hannah,Super friendly and hospitable! Such a convenient location!
30285774,431946663,2019-04-02,10910775,Federica,"Fantastico!!!!L'appartamento di Sokol è molto accogliente e in una posizione strategica!Ci sono tutti i confort per trascorrere una vacanza (Website hidden by Airbnb) pulizia è impeccabile,lo stratagemma per il check in senza doversi accordare l'ho trovata un idea straordinaria ed efficace,soprattutto se,come noi,si viaggia con un bimbo al seguito.Consigliatissimo!"
30285774,432909210,2019-04-05,233691353,Ajaykumar,"Sokol's apartment is a brand new apartment very close to all the major attractions like Plaka, Acropolis.  Sokol and his wife were excellent hosts and we had no trouble getting in there. Its close to a lot of Asian restaurants and helped us get some Indian food, when we were missing them. Highly recommended!"
30285774,433265247,2019-04-06,16724584,Kara,Loved our stay at Sokol's apartment! We were a group of 4 and we decided to take the taxi he arranged for us. The driver was so kind he even coordinated getting two of us SIM cards on the way. Some of the reviews state the area can make one uneasy. We were split on that in our group. It's not that far of a walk to the square and the building is quite secure. We would stay there again.
30285774,434580495,2019-04-08,81220159,Morgan,"The apartment is beautiful and has everything you would need for a trip. Sokol arranged pickup from the airport which was easy, reliable and made for a safe journey to the apartment, especially with a late flight arrival. The apartment is quiet, modern, excellent wifi and views from the rooftop. A quick walk to the acropolis and Sokol provides local recommendations with directions. <br/>Excellent choice!"
30285774,436462079,2019-04-13,12141452,Geoffrey,"Parfait pour un séjour en famille à Athènes. Le logement est très bien équipé. Sokol est très réactif et n'hésite pas à prendre de nos nouvelles pendant le séjour afin de savoir si tout se passe bien. Le quartier est bien situé, à 10 min de Monastiraki. Nous recommandons ce logement."
30285774,440028164,2019-04-20,22046099,Ann-Kathrin,"Sokols Apartment ist so modern und schön, wie es die Bilder vermuten lassen. Sokol ist ein toller Gastgeber, sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich. Fragt oft nach, ob man etwas braucht. Kam direkt, als es ein Problem mit dem Abfluss gab und löste das Problem. Hat uns Wasser bringen lassen als die Leitungen in dem Gebiet abgeschaltet waren. Und begrüßt wurden wir mit Keksen und einem kleinen Geschenk! Der selbstständige Checkin ist einfach. Die Wohnung ist zentral, nicht weit von Monastiraki. Die Nachbarschaft ist nicht so toll, aber unsicher haben wir uns trotzdem nicht gefühlt. Ich würde jederzeit wieder zu Sokol kommen!"
30285774,440621186,2019-04-21,19987864,Amanda,"Sokol is the reason why we love staying with Airbnb - you can never get this kind of hospitality elsewhere.<br/><br/>This is our second time booking an apartment with Sokol and the place pleasantly surprised us even more than the first. It is Spacious, for the price you’re paying. It is well furnished with amenities (extra pull out sofa in the living room, balcony, bathroom with heater and towels ready, bedroom with heater). <br/><br/>We were thankful to check in to some tidbits too - biscuits, oranges, water and bread. <br/><br/>Although we only stayed for a night, the hosts made sure we enjoyed the full extent of Greek hospitality. We arrived at 11pm at Athens station and he had us picked up in a taxi by his Friend to the Airbnb. Everything was well arranged, and his replies were prompt, despite it being a public holiday.<br/><br/>His taxi Friend is 100% trust worthy and punctual - he sent us to the airport for a small fee (we shared the cab ride with another tourist from Sokol’s apartments to make it cheaper).<br/><br/>All in all, we will be back to stay (and maybe try another one of Sokol’s accommodations) for sure! Sokol deserves every bit of being called a SuperHost.<br/><br/>Highly recommended - excellent."
30285774,443549995,2019-04-26,4229475,Tim,"We are a couple. The apartment was very clean, secure and compact. Perfect for our needs and we wouldn’t really have needed anything more. Sokol was great and checked in with us each day by the Airbnb app. He also gave us a lift to the train station one morning as we’d mentioned we were doing a trip out of Athens. A really nice guy. Don’t let the location put you off. You do need to walk through a more dilapidated part of town for, literally, no more than 3 minutes but locals were totally disinterested in us and other tourists were walking in the same area, obviously staying  around there too. The value for money was excellent (we would have been happy to pay a little more) and we’re glad we chose Sokol’s property."
30285774,443819859,2019-04-26,4150728,Kristina,Sokol was very welcoming and friendly and his place was perfectly located near the Acropolis!
30285774,447277907,2019-05-03,66211417,Christine,"Sokol was a great host, he was very responsive and even checked in during our stay to ensure we had everything we needed.  As mentioned in other reviews, the block the apt is on is not great, but within a few blocks the area improves and there are good restaurants nearby.  We had a great stay!"
30285774,449671572,2019-05-07,41593966,Anand,Great apartment and location. Sokol was very attentive and helpful and even arranged to store our bag on the final day. Highly recommended.
30285774,449971516,2019-05-08,110615122,Emma,"Very nice apartment, very kind host! Sokol responded every message fast and arranged taxi service and luggage deposit for us, and the  apartment is very well equipped. Love this place and best wish to the chinese proprietary's business."
30285774,451185243,2019-05-11,233716403,Taylor,Very nice apartment with great security. Quick responses from Sokol. However it was just 2 girls staying here and it felt a little unsafe at nighttime in the neighborhood.
30285774,452842520,2019-05-14,113340585,Rosa,"Our trip started off very well with a detailed description of how to get to the place. Also, the pictures don't lie, the apartment actually looks that great! It was very clean and neat. The hospitality, too, was perfect."
30285774,453992717,2019-05-17,136581397,Swati,This is a super cozy apartment and very close to Plaka and monastiraki square but one needs to be a little watchful in this neighbourhood. The host is extremely warm and kind.
30285774,456342306,2019-05-21,29649063,Stacy,Sokol was great and so helpful place fantastic!
30285774,459274051,2019-05-27,230434391,Eddie,"This property is centrally located and is but a modest walk to most of the things that one needs to see and do in Athens. The immediate area is a little shabby but once inside you are in a very secure property with a lift to the 7th floor and a flight of stairs to a roof terrace  with a panoramic view of Athens. The apartment is of modest size but more than adequate for two, immaculately presented with all the necessary bits and bobs (toaster, microwave fridge 2 TVs even a shoe horn!) that one might need for a short stay. We received a daily message from our host to check everything was ok or if we needed anything. Thank you Sokol (and your wife Angela) for a wonderful stay. You are indeed a SUPERHOST!"
30285774,460463410,2019-05-29,40869822,Justin,Parfait
30285774,460746738,2019-05-30,130033611,Haley,"Sokol’s apartment is clean, organized, and centrally located. He provided clear and informative check-in instructions and directions to the apartment; he also included a list of restaurants and nightlife options he recommended in the neighborhood. The apartment felt very safe despite its location in a downtown location. Overall, we had a very positive stay at Sokol’s apartment!"
30285774,462364359,2019-06-02,152801038,Mikhail,"We were very positively surprised by the place - with direct view on Acropolis from the terrace on the top of the building. Sokol is a great host - very caring and responsive, would highly recommend him!"
30285774,463849562,2019-06-04,144019366,Kinsey,"This apartment was stunning! Brand new building, modern touches, and lots of amenities. The location was within walking distance of everything which was convenient, however the area caught us off-guard a bit. It seems pretty run-down and there were some questionable people hanging out around the building, so with 3 girls traveling alone it made us slightly uncomfortable."
30285774,465077321,2019-06-07,20018797,Ann Marie,"Do not let the look of the neighbourhood put you off. Locals are friendly, helpful and do not hassle the tourists.<br/>The building is modern, clean and aesthetically pleasing both inside and out.<br/>Sokol was very accommodating, always in touch to ensure our stay was like being home and made recommendations for outings etc.<br/>Would most definitely recommend this very spacious apt!!"
30285774,466238451,2019-06-09,70209307,Patrick,Great place! Apartment is very updated and is a very comfy stay. Spacious as well. Sokol is a great host and is very responsive. Will also help you locate places around Athens. Wonderful stay! Will be back

30285774,471721035,2019-06-18,176863889,Matt,Awesome apartment close to everything. Sokol is very very helpful and is willing to go above and beyond for anything you need.
30285774,476455098,2019-06-26,33236987,Shawn,"Great space and very clean. As with other reviews, the neighborhood is urban, but it is safe and within walking distance to great restaurants and the sites. Sokol is a wonderful host."
30285774,481159876,2019-07-04,60105857,Pantelis,Είναι όλα όπως φαίνονται. Θα ξαναμέναμε σίγουρα!
30285774,484604942,2019-07-09,120716688,Jan,"The apartment is very clean, well equipped and offers a well functioning air condition in both rooms. It's also located very good for experiencing Athens historic sites but also for its night live. The best although is the kindness of Sokol, who offers help in any situation. Everything he organized for me worked perfectly well. I would definitely come again. Definitely."
30285774,485584361,2019-07-11,117522295,Kelly,"Sokol s place is central to most attractions of interest.  It’s in a quieter area and walking distance to everything. The apartment is very stylish and quite comfortable. He is a very responsive host, arranged our transfers and checked in on us regularly to see if we needed anything.  Highly recommend this host"
30285774,486122602,2019-07-12,23132003,Ashley,We had a group of four for just a one night stay and it was perfectly comfortable. The self check-in was simple and straight forward. The place itself is very nice and had everything we needed. I would recommend a stay here for sure!
30285774,486733143,2019-07-13,20137765,Nur Suhaylah,"Sokol is a great host that go extra mile to make sure we get to the apartment and to the airport. The apartment is clean and comfortable to stay in. For a Muslim, the apartment is very convenient to halal restaurant and mini market by walking distance."
30285774,487731783,2019-07-14,8314659,Nancy,"Our stay was great. The apartment is great value. It is ideal for 2-3 people. The night life near this apartment is really good. The street were the apartment is located doesnt have the good bars/rests, but if you walk 5-10 min you find great places."
30285774,490614151,2019-07-19,226502751,Sophie,"I loved this apartment. It was a truly stunning apartment with amazing amenities and was spotless upon arrival. Sokol was an amazing host and replied very quickly to any questions I had while staying. The only thing that I did not like was the location, if you are a young traveler like myself, I would suggest somewhere like Plaka as Korinis which is quite near Omonia can be a somewhat intimidating area to be in if you aren’t familiar with the area. But other than that this apartment and host are truly a five star rating to me."
30285774,490805707,2019-07-19,269473357,Yoav,Amazing apartment<br/>New and well maintained<br/>Room level of a 5-star hotel<br/>The apartment is very close to the city center and all the important sites<br/>But is in a neighborhood of foreign workers and quite scary to walk outside the building<br/>But after 2-3 minutes walking are already in a pleasant place

30285774,500533487,2019-08-02,131884344,Nicola,"The building and apt are amazing. Brand new, very nice furnished! Super clean. Certainly the right place to stay to visit Athens on foot. Sokol is a great host. The apt is located just few minutes from restaurants and shops. To go there u need to go through an area which looks a little dirty, but nothing to worry about. <br/>Inside the apt is very comfortable. Beds and lines are excellent. Shower is modern. View from terrace is breathtaking. Go there, if you want to be at walking distance from Monastiraki sq, at a fair price."
30285774,506081073,2019-08-10,73182974,Antonio,"El apartamento está muy bien equipado, limpio y decorado con gusto. Es perfecto para tres o cuatro personas. Está cerca de la estación de Monastiraki pero en un barrio un tanto degradado."

30285774,522536067,2019-09-02,72785442,Sydney,Sokol's Airbnb was the perfect place for us to recover from jet lag and explore the beautiful city of Athens. The apartment was sparkling clean and had everything needed for a wonderful stay. The bed was cozy and the shower had plenty of warm water. It was also convenient to many restaraunts and sites. If we return to Athens we would absolutely stay here again.

30285774,524988052,2019-09-07,62994070,Melissa,The family loved our stay at Sokol’s. The best was the bathroom- shower is fantastic. The space is great and was very comfortable for our family of 4. It’s great that there is other amenities in the building as well. Thanks again

30285774,527564424,2019-09-11,135676752,Paulo,"A estadia no apartamento do Sokol foi muito boa. O apartamento é muito bonito e com uma localização boa para quem quer estar perto do centro de Atenas. O Sokol foi um muito bom anfitrião, rápido nas respostas às mensagens e sempre com boas indicações de transportes e de locais a visitar. O apartamento é muito bom e muito limpo. Gostamos muito e esperamos um dia voltar."
30285774,531787027,2019-09-18,14112079,Ana,"The flat was very clean and exactly as described. The host provided quick answers. The only ""but"" is the area. The location is great, very central and within walking distance of many amenities but also filthy streets and homelesses.  We had a great stay overall!"

30285774,533114861,2019-09-21,192477032,Kirill,A good place to stay in Athens. Clean and comfortable. Walking distance from the city center. Communication with the host was very reliable.
30285774,535780373,2019-09-25,3725264,Piero,Tutto perfetto e appartamento davvero bello. Bagno con una doccia meravigliosa! Il letto era un po’ piccolo per due persone ma comunque comodo. Di sera la via non è delle migliori ma basta girare l’angolo e cambia tutto ed è vicinissimo al centro. Grazie ancora per la perfetta ospitalità.
30285774,537222078,2019-09-28,118943112,James,Exceptional value in a great location handy to restaurants and bars as well as the Acropolis and the Plaka shopping area. Such a well managed and modern apartment with attentive communication.

30285774,541437237,2019-10-05,233512226,Carina,"Das Apartment ist sehr modern eingerichtet, wie auch die Fotos schon vermuten lassen. Alles war total sauber und es lagen sogar ein paar Snacks und Geschenke für uns bereit. Die Gastgeber waren immer gut erreichbar und fragten auch mehrmals nach, ob bei uns alles ok ist. Einziger Minuspunkt ist die schon deutlich heruntergekommene Umgebung, aber das macht die toll eingerichtete Wohnung wieder wett. Sehr weiterzuempfehlen!"
30285774,543672565,2019-10-08,30024844,Darlene,Beautiful place! Felt very comfortable here.

30285774,549192975,2019-10-18,30934377,Antoinette,La verdad es que la hemos pasado espectacular!!! Las atenciones de Sokol y las de Harry han superado nuestras expectativas. Su apartamento es Hermoso y nos hemos sentido como en casa. Super cerca de TODO . Nos hemos sentido muy seguros. definitivamente el que ustedes hayan estado tan pendientes de nuestra estadía nos ha hecho sentir mucho mas seguros.
30285774,550746709,2019-10-19,101970546,Akinyi,Sokol’s place is very stylish and was sparkling clean when we arrived. He was thoughtful enough to leave us some cookies and nuts on arrival and even a souvenir from Athens. The neighborhood is close to tourist attractions and the artsy part of Athens. Highly recommend!
30285774,552151519,2019-10-21,149636851,Jorge,"Great place! I highly recommended , the apartment is very nice and Sokol is always there to help."

30285774,559927739,2019-11-05,112676426,Jane,Marilena som hjælper Sokol var enestående smset med hende for at få tips og ideer til vores ophold. Taxichaufføren som hjælper var fantastisk som guide og hentede og bragte os til rimelig pris meget venlige og hjælpsomme. Vores uge i Athen var en fest. Kan varmt anbefale Sokol lejlighed
30285774,562603649,2019-11-11,74197960,Erin,Beautiful space! Amazing amenities! In a secured building with an elevator.
30285774,564135682,2019-11-15,70586595,Jeff,"First AirBnB we have been to that has had a left luggage area for early arrivals/ late departures and I must say this was an amazing feature when travelling with kids and a bunch of luggage.  Got off our early ferry, dropped off our stuff, and headed out for breakfast.<br/><br/>Hosts were very helpful offering local tips and great flexibility- checking in if we needed anything.<br/><br/>Space is very clean, well appointed and super comfortable for our family of 4.  Kitchen area is in entrance hall but very serviceable.<br/><br/>Amazing rooftop bar and patio area with a special seating area framing the Acropolis.  Perfect to take a morning coffee or evening beverage.<br/><br/>Neighbourhood is bordering on some rougher area but just head towards Acropolis direction and feels fine... lots of new development going on around so this is soon to be an upcoming neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Amazing value and super helpful hosts.  Check out the central market 5 mins away for fresh fish and great selection of produce."
30285774,574333740,2019-12-08,292519938,Clare,"I would definitely stay there again, it was fantastic!"
30285774,578622282,2019-12-18,215783494,Shushan,Very nice apartment. The communication was perfect. We had a perfect trip
30285774,580737080,2019-12-23,310175160,Thanasis,"Ο χώρος ήταν όπως στις φωτογραφίες, το μόνο μείον προσωπικά ήταν η περιοχή διότι είναι κοντά στην ομόνοια και είχε πολλούς ξένους και άστεγους, ωστόσο το βράδυ ήταν σχετικά ήσυχα,."
30285774,586653342,2020-01-02,22149193,Stefanie,"Great apartment, good location, convenient self check-in, amazing shower & beautiful roof terrace!"
30285774,588824063,2020-01-05,52341380,Eugene,Sokol's place is great! Very near the monumental places in Athens. He's very kind and helpful as well!
30285774,593508599,2020-01-16,41196643,Elitsa,"We are a family of 3, with a 6-year old son. Here's our experience:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Communication with the host is great and fast! He had prepared a very detailed guide with directions of how to get to the place, how to enter and what to do inside, list with local attractions, stores and restaurants, even an everyday route to Acropolis and other landmarks that would guide us through the nicer parts of the close neighbourhood. We didn't have any difficulties with anything and Sokol was always online to help.<br/><br/>The appartment is very cosy, clean, quiet and modern and offers everything you may need. The building is new and the terrace is great with a great view to the Acropolis. We even had the opportunity to cook because we didn't want to go out at the evenings. It has a central heating and is overall very warm (we visited in January). Great value for the prise.<br/><br/>Location: it's really close to city center, 10 mins away from metro station and Monastiraki sq., 15 minutes away from Acropolis and all the the landmarks, 20 mins from Syntagma sq. etc. We like to visit museums and landmarks and we had no trouble walking to all we had planned.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>While the location overall is great, the close neighbourhood is a bit shady, as there are a lot of wholesale stores and shops that - while hosted by very friendly people - attract a lot of immigrants and you feel more like you are in the Middle East, than in Europe. If that is not bothering you, it's ok, the nice and picturesque streets of Athens you expect to see are only 100 meters away, anyway.  Either way it's a good idea to follow the route Sokol offered to get to the center (by the park and then around the parking lot), because if you step away, you may meet junkies or other unpleasant views. We chose to not go out with the kid after the sun sets.<br/>The stores of the close proximity offer only middle-eastern goods we are not accomodated to, so we had buy food or drinks from supermarkets further away or when we got back from our tourist walks. That's not a big issue, as the closest big supermarkets are some 600 meters away in both directions and there are a lot of bakeries along the way.<br/><br/>Overall: We enjoyed our stay, didn't lack anything and we felt comfortable. As for the surroundings, that's not something the host can have control on and besides he made the effort to walk us through, so while it had an impact on the overall experience - it's not affecting the rating much. 4,9 from 5 stars from us. Thank you for the hospitality!"
30285774,594860262,2020-01-19,1605375,Thanasis,"The apartment looks like what you see in the photos, it's new, and well-equipped.<br/><br/>However, there are some important drawbacks, deal-breakers, due to which I wouldn't book this place again. <br/><br/>The first is the location. Even though it's relatively close to the centre, the streets immediately close to the apartment are quite rough, feel unsafe, with homeless people, drug-addicts etc. As I was travelling with my family, we felt quite insecure.<br/><br/>The second (which is something that I never expected would be an issue) is that the apartment is very, very poorly sound-insulated. I've never experienced such a thing before. We were sitting in the living room, and at some point we were scared because we heard noises and conversations coming from the bedroom and we thought someone had broken into the apartment. It was actually people from the nearby apartment, and it felt as if they were right next to us, we could easily hear exactly what they were talking about. This unfortunately got worse during the night. We barely slept as we were woken up by traffic noises, alarms going off all the time, and around 4am a couple from a nearby apartment who was having an extremely loud 'good time'. We weren't the only ones who we were woken up by this couple, people from nearby apartments we complaining as well.<br/><br/>Just to clarify; one cannot of course predict or prevent alarms going off, or couples being too noisy. That's not the problem. The problem is that if walls are paper-thin, of course there is going to be a disturbing noise, either by nearby apartments or coming from the street. <br/><br/>And this is coming from someone who is not easily woken up. I have a young child, and I sleep even if there is a crying baby in the next room.<br/><br/>This is my first negative review for an Airbnb, and I've been using airbnbs all the time for almost a decade now. I just felt that other travellers needed to know about this (especially about the location), and we need to keep our reviews honest, otherwise this is pointless."

30285774,599756946,2020-01-31,145360176,Anouche,Sokol's place is perfect for a city trip. The location is not the best in Athens but it wasn't a problem for my friends and I. We found the place very clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed and Sokol is always available for anything. The view on the rooftop is sooo beautiful! I totally recommend this place!

With clear instructions it’s possible to check in at any time, wich was  an advantage for us! Sokol is a great host and will help you with everything.

30286383,441810941,2019-04-22,13308440,Olga,The apartment is very clean and modern - you can visit Athens old town on feet. Good value for money. Sokol is very responsive and he allowed us to leave luggage longer last dat to visit the city.   Nice terrace at the top of the biuding with the view on Acropolis - great for some drinks at the evening (otherwise you have plenty bars within 5 minutes from the apartment) . The only thing I would change is the neighborhood - unfortunately not very clean and can seem a bit scary at night. Thank you Sokol!

L'appartement est très bien placé, on peut tout faire a pied, très proche de tous les sites historiques et autres monuments. Petit bémol le quartier qui est insalubre et qui peut effrayer...mais nous n'avons pas eu de soucis et l'accès à l'immeuble de l'appartement est hyper sécurisé. L'appartement est propre chaleureux et la terrasse est un plus avec une très belle vue sur l'Acropole. Nous reviendrons avec plaisir !"
30286383,450746146,2019-05-10,50128237,Noemi,"Vacanza in coppia ad Atene. Siamo molto soddisfatti della scelta. L'appartamento si trova in un edificio moderno, pulito e sicuro. è possibile raggiungere il proprio appartamento anche tramite ascensore. L'ambiente è pulito e ben organizzato, curato nei dettagli (climatizzazione, acqua potabile filtrata dal lavabo, avvolgibili automatici). Arredamento interni semplici ma gradevoli. Anche il bagno ben tenuto. Molto carina anche la possibilità di prendersi un aperitivo sulla terrazza comune con vista dell'Acropoli illuminata! Al primo piano c'è una palestra attrezzata con vari macchinari ad uso libero e al piano terra una lavatrice a gettoni. Wifi gratuito anche nelle stanze. Se necessario è possibile lasciare i propri bagagli in custodia per andarli a ritirare prima della partenza. <br/>Ringraziamo Sokol e suo figlio per la gentilezza e la disponibilità dimostrata. Consigliato!"

Beautiful decoration and perfect for a stay in Athens for 2.<br/>Sokol is very nice and makes sure everything is fine.<br/>The neighbourhood though is a bit quiet and looks quite scary at night, but the bars and restaurant are at a close walking distance. <br/>Things that we enjoyed : the presents and food to welcome us, and the roof top."
30286383,455731852,2019-05-20,69533813,Kamil,The place is as described. The location is perfect if you like to walk on foot (which we did!) - no need to take any trains/metros/taxis to main attractions which can save you a lot of money. Sokol was very helpful and was responding almost immediately. The neighborhood is not the cleanest but that’s the charm of Athens - the building in which the apartment is situated on the other hand is very clean and modern. In our honest opinion that’s probably one of the best finds in the city centre!
30286383,457064703,2019-05-23,240561876,Janina,"The appartment and the building are very nice, modern ans clean. It is just two streets away from Psirri with a lot of bars and restaurants and ten minutes to Monastiraki square with the metro station to port and airport. You can walk to all the sights. As mentioned in other reviews, the neighbourhood itself seems a bit scary. The rooftop view is really cool."

My favourite part were the completely black-out curtains!! I slept like a baby! Despite being in a neighbourhood that feels a bit sketchy, the building feels very well secured and safe and is beautiful. The rooftop is awesome as well. Sokol was a great host and communicator."
30286383,476811487,2019-06-27,162594860,Andrew,"Wonderful shower. By far the best shower of all my stays in Athens (or Greece for that matter). For a nice deep clean, stay at Sokol’s."
30286383,478660741,2019-06-30,257848353,Jessy,Loved the place! It is close to everything and the rooftop is very nice during the evening.
30286383,481691106,2019-07-05,227596127,Margaux,"Sokol est un hôte très attentionné qui nous a aidé tout au long de notre séjour. Il nous a aidé notamment pour trouver un taxi. Il a été très réactif à nos différentes questions. Un grand merci à lui !<br/>De plus, l’appartement est très bien situé pour visiter Athènes (5min de la station Monastiraki à pieds)"
30286383,485097410,2019-07-10,36913928,Jack,"This is not a safe neighborhood for tourists. I do not recommend you stay here. <br/><br/>Sokol is very nice, the amenities for this place were perfect. I am sure Sokol’s other listings are wonderful. <br/><br/>I speak only from experience of living in Athens, Greece when I worked homeless on the streets. I have visited almost every corner of this city through my former work, this is one of the more rough parts of Athens. <br/><br/>Let me be clear: the area just north of Psiri (Evripidou street and north of that, not Psiri itself) is robustly known by almost all locals as unsafe. <br/><br/>This has nothing to do with race, language or religion. During my time at this listing, I saw men on the doing drugs, one man defecating on the side of the street and others making sexual remarks to a passerby woman. <br/><br/>Greece is currently at the forefront of the migrant crisis and many are shuffled into this area. It’s a tragic part today’s situation and the government of Greece, the EU and NGOs aren’t doing enough to help these migrants move to their final destinations that live on the streets here. I am hopeful those that live on the streets will find shelter. <br/><br/>Perhaps in the future this place will become a more upcoming spot, but not quite yet."
30286383,489068375,2019-07-16,260319026,Stella,We needed a small place close to the Acropolis for the day - this was perfect.  A really clean and tidy place with awesome amenities - gym and rooftop terrace with incredible views.  It literally was a 20 min walk to the top of the Acropolis - awesome.  I also needed help with early luggage storage and taxis and all this was organised quickly with ease. Lovely gift and yummy nibbles too- thanks Sokol!
30286383,493128393,2019-07-22,66864806,Henna,"Sokol’s place is overall good with a very pristine studio apartment. The interior of the building is new and the room itself looks exactly like the picture. Sokol himself is very approachable and fast reply on messages. Really appreciate his daily check on us through the Airbnb inbox to make sure everything is alright. However, I’m really dissatisfied with the location of the apartment. Although it’s like ten minutes walk from the city centre of Athens, the neighborhood looks very messy and I don’t think it’s very suitable for tourists. We had to take a cab every night to go back to Sokol’s place just to be safe, and I’ve received advices from taxi driver to not walk on a particular alley because it could be dangerous. The building of the apartment is very new and once you go inside, you feel safer. Although I must say walls seems to be thin because throughout staying there, we could hear people next door and some people screaming on the lower floor, not very pleasant if you need more sleep in the morning (We kept getting woken up by these noises like every morning). Our room is literally in front of the elevator and every time people taking the elevator, we can hear them talking really loud. I give it 4 stars overall because the studio itself is very clean and comfortable and worth the money (if you don’t mind the location and the noises)."
30286383,493921450,2019-07-23,75527652,Fibfab,"A very nice place to stay. The view from the terrace at the top is very nice. The area directly around the flat isa bit intimidating, however we had no trouble and the building is very secure. A couple of minutes from the center. I recommand this place."

30286383,502935010,2019-08-05,166965996,Sebastian,"Apartment is located in part of the city from which you have a walking distance to Acropolis, Greek Agora, bars and restaurants. Surrounding streets are not clean and you can meet homeless people from time to time, but I have not feel dangerous even late at night. Apartment is excellent for two people and you will find there everything you need. From kitchen appliances to iron and first aid kit. Host is very responsive and helpful. Check in and check out is very convenient at any time of the day."

30286383,524038081,2019-09-05,269826567,Lourdes,"You can’t ask more to a Host. Sokol looked after us at all times. The room was spotless and exactly as you see in the pictures. It is 5 minutes from the center and you can see the Acropolis from the roof. Very close to the restaurant streets as well.. The neighbourhood looks a bit unsafe during the night but it is not and you can always take a taxi. Sokol helped us with that as well, plus it is Very cheap!"
30286383,525613237,2019-09-08,230867419,Tim,"Great place. Clean and tidy. Handy to all attractions and transport. Only watch out is some of the streets around the apartment are a little dodgy, but the host is very helpful in providing alternative routes. Highly recommended."

It's well located in Athens (you are 8 min away from the center) - eventhough the neighborhood is not the prettiest. Sokol is a very helpful host, he will give you everything you need ! I would totally recommend :)"
30286383,530817930,2019-09-16,63263880,Monica,"I would highly recommend Sokol’s apartment for one or two people. His apartment is in a great location with food and markets nearby within walking distance. My husband and I stayed there and Sokol immediately communicates with you and gives you easy to read direction for self check in. Once you enter his apartment he welcomed us with some snacks and a souvenir. We automatically felt welcomed. There’s a gym downstairs, washer on the ground floor, and amazing rooftop you should check out. We had dinner and drank a beer or two while looking at the city view. I will be visiting again in the future and highly recommend this place to my family, friends, and fellow Airbnb buddies. You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Monica & Eric"
30286383,532646829,2019-09-20,137085359,Ferda,"Sokol is a really super host - always friendly and quick in responding all questions and helping! We really enjoyed our stay in this apartment. It has all you need and it is very clean, which is very important for me. The location is central so you can go by feet everywhere. The building, where the aparment is located also offers nice extras like opportunity to buy water or snacks, to wash cloths, a gym and not to forget the super nice view of the rooftop. Thank you very much! :)"
30286383,533225647,2019-09-21,72126323,Kimberly,"The inside of this place was very well decorated. The host left cookies and a gift, which was a nice gesture. The area is very close to the Acropolis. We were able to walk there with no problem. The area can be intimidating at night time. We took taxis to and from the apartment at night and had no issues. <br/><br/>Thank you again to the amazing hosts!"
30286383,537131956,2019-09-28,28689299,Aida,Great apartment inside but definitely in a sketchy area which isn’t communicated in the listing itself and comes as quite a shock when you’re walking through with all your luggage and are clearly a tourist.
30286383,539377901,2019-10-01,267654355,Luis Guillermo,"Recomendable el estudio para parejas, está en un barrio muy alternativo, al principio pareciera ""asustarte"" un poco, pero me gustó el arte callejero que se puede observar al rededor, por la noche hay varios sitios para cenar y beber cerveza que se encuentran a tan solo unas cuadras. Está muy cerca de plaza Monastiraki, y relativamente cerca de la Acrópolis, caminando a unos 25 mins. El estudio es perfecto para una pareja, pequeño pero con lo necesario, la vista de la terraza hacia la acrópolis es increíble."

The host takes great care of his guests, made us feel really welcome. Cozy space with spectacular views of Athens from the terrace"
30286383,547781279,2019-10-16,56558159,Navi,"Enjoyed this stay thoroughly - being Indian myself, I enjoyed the Indian/Pakistanani community - never once did I feel unsafe and the location was super close to the Acropolis and center. <br/>When I needed help finding a new place to stay ASAP Sokol and his partner were quick to help and found me another spot!"
30286383,550620686,2019-10-19,60855748,Lauren,"Good place, fantastic communication with Sokol and Harry checking in each day to see if there was anything we needed. The surrounding area was just a little sketchy at 3am when we were leaving for our flight - fine in the day so not really an issue. Overall, would stay again and excellent value."

L'immeuble possède une salle de sport, ce qui a bien plu à mon compagnon. L'appartement est propre et fonctionnel. Nous avons été très bien accueillis et nous nous sommes sentis comme chez nous. Sokol est disponible et attentif à notre confort tout au long du séjour. L'entrée autonome et les casiers pour laisser les bagages sont très pratiques ! Merci ! Je reviendrai sans hésiter chez vous !"

The hosts were extremely quick to respond and checked in multiple times during our stay. The apartment was immaculately clean, newly remodeled had everything we could possibly need the rooftop with views of the acropolis was a lovely way to relax after a long day of touring athens. We would 100% recommend and would not hesitate to stay here if we are in Athens again."

30286383,577202422,2019-12-15,244500220,Вук,"Overall this is amazing accommodation! Very clean apartment. It is a little bit small because there is a room with Tv and bad plus small kitchen and toilette, but for staying in city where you are outside all the day, it is no important! In apartment you have ALL that you need, but I really mean ALL! It is very equipped. Host is very nice and helpful. One of the top 3 accommodation and hosts I have ever been.<br/>Location is great, but you have to know that neighborhood is ghetto because all non Greek people. It is a little bit uncomfortable if you are a female."

The view on the rooftop is amazing.<br/><br/>The neighbourhood is nice, except for a few shady streets, there are a lot of quaint and agreeable restaurants and coffeeshops !

Everything is new and very clean, the studio is small but you have everything you need, a small kitchenette with tools, etc. I have been in many AirBnBs in Athens, but this was one of the best. The area looks a bit scary, but in 10 minutes walk (600m) you are in Monastiraki. There was also a free gym in the building!<br/><br/>Don't miss the Seychelles restaurant, as suggested by Sokol, no tourists, great food and a real Greek experience at less than 10 minutes walk from the apartment!"

Location is great as you can go walking to many touristic places such as the Acropolis, we never used the subway because evertything was close by. There are also many nice restaurants and bars 5 minutes walking from the appartment. The appartment has a lot of security, the street is a bit dark and not crowded at night during the week days, so we sort of walk fast hehe but nothing happen. As it is in downtown the neighburhood is not that pretty but the location is worthy. Great communication with Sokol all the time! He always checked if we needed anything else, and helped us arrange a taxi from the airport to the appartment and also back. The taxi driver was super nice!"

So i did it, photos of appartment just looked the same and I was thinking its the same appartment.<br/>la voila, actually, it was not the same appartment. so at 14 February, we have to checked out and move to the other place. I was really angry about this, so i asked to cancel. <br/>Why he did not answer, ""sorry this appartment was already booked by another person"""

Realmente recomendable"
30286826,429172158,2019-03-27,99257776,Han Soo,아테네 시내 아시안 타운 안쪽에 있습니다. 식축건물에 모든 편의시설이 갖춰져 있으며 청결도도 흠잡을 부분이 없습니다. 호스트의 응답도 빠른편이며 작은 테라스와 위층의 전망좋은 루프탑 바도 있기에 좋습니다. 아주 좋은숙소이지만 위치가 파키스탄 인도 이주자 타운 근처라서 여자분 혼자돌아다니기엔 약간 무서운 분위기일수도 있으며 편의점 말고 장볼만한 큰마트는 15분가량 걸어가야 하기 때문에 참고 부탁드립니다. 종합적으론 추천드립니다.
30286826,429822407,2019-03-29,22754649,Olya,"The flat is very comfortable, clean and has good location. The view from the rooftop is stunning. Sokol helped us a lot by giving useful tips about the city."
30286826,433820122,2019-04-07,69594741,Yuan,"房源位置在Omonia 交通都很方便离景点也很近,只是,我们到了后才发现这个区算是移民区吧走在路上很没有安全感,周围环境有点脏乱,但是公寓里面是很好的｡虽然每次出门回家的时候都很害怕,但也没发生任何事情｡我们每天都尽量4点就回家,避免晚上路过街道....但这个公寓性价比是很好的｡房东人很好,还送了我们小礼物还有饼干和花生｡谢谢"
30286826,434670902,2019-04-08,144847715,Henry,"Sokol's apartment is modern and comfortably houses 4 people. Sokol was very responsive and gave great suggestions for things to do in the city. If you're looking to stay in Athens, definitely stay at Sokol's apartment!"
30286826,436968057,2019-04-14,229073417,Pia,Sokols place was perfect. It was totally clean and comfortable. The check- in and check-out was easy and we even could leave our stuff there after the check-out. He answered our messages really fast and was very friendle! We actually never met him but the communication was very good. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to everybody who is going to a Athens.
30286826,438576901,2019-04-17,74137546,Carmen,"Sehr schöne Wohnung in Athen mit toller Lage. Die Gegend ist aus dem wahren Athener Leben (also keine Touristen Gegend) - es stellt sich schnell heraus, dass man hier nah an allen wichtigen Stellen ist und viel aus der Gegend schöpfen kann (Essen, Läden, ... ) wir würden jederzeit wieder dort buchen."

Sokol es muy atento y siempre pendiente de si necesitamos algo. Nos guardo las valijas en el check out hasta la hora q salió nuestro vuelo y además nos recomendó a un amigo de el taxista Alexis Que fue muy agradable y nos hizo un viaje muy lindo . Sin duda si volvemos Athenas volveremos con Sokol

30286826,449226774,2019-05-06,83173194,Sarai,"El apartamento es 5 estrellas, hasta nos dejó galletas, dulces y un obsequio de bienvenida. Sokol es un anfitrión detallista, amable, muy servicial y siempre estuvo disponible para lo que necesitara, incluso todas las noches enviaba mensaje para ver si necesitábamos algo, muy noble de su parte. Se puede ir caminando al Acrópolis, restaurantes, tiendas, las Plazas Monastiraki y Syntagma ya que todo queda muy cerca. El check in y check out es muy fácil. Lo recomiendo 100%."

30286826,453526925,2019-05-16,238827712,Tasha,We had the most amazing stay at Sokol’s place! He was very quick to respond to any questions we had and when our power went out he sent someone to fix it within 10 minutes. The location is ideal - a 10 minute walk to 2 different metro stations and a 20-30 minute walk to the acropolis. I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone travelling to Athens!
30286826,454330452,2019-05-18,227664451,Annie,"We had a wonderful stay in this apartment. The location is prefect, the building is very safe and the apartment is beautiful and exactly as presented online. We were very satisfied with this apartment and we would recommend it to anyone! One of my friends needed to leave early for the airport and Sokol was very helpful in finding a taxi and helping us out."

30286826,460794126,2019-05-30,188114191,Tazue,"The apartments are in an area that quite a bit of trash outside. <br/>The interior of the building has safety measures and is very clean. <br/>Other than the appearance of the surroundings, our stay was quite pleasant.   We were able to leave our car parked for 2 says and 3 nights and walk to the majority of the attractions. <br/>It was nice not to have to drive and find a parking place."

30286826,463300790,2019-06-03,103358628,Ronny,"One of my best experiences using Airbnb! Sokol's place is perfect! Super clean, everything looks like new and even though we didn't have the pleasure to speak in person (the communication was super easy and fast) it was the most warm welcome we received during our trip in Europe. The terrace view to the Acropolis is breathtaking, welcome snacks, coffee... all the atentions you want when traveling and more! Greece is going thru a difficult moment and that you can see almost everywhere, the neighborhood might not be beautiful (not Sokol's fault of course), and there are much inmigrants (everywhere not just there) and that might be a little shocking for people who has not been exposed to their culture and costums, but we walked in and out the apartment late at night and did not have the minimun problem, everybody was respectful and did not mind us at all! <br/>And even to go to the airport Sokol got us a taxi (which cancelled at the last minute and he solved the problem for us!).<br/>If there were more stars I'd give them to Sokol and his place! Thank you for making our visit to Athens so welcoming!"
30286826,463837378,2019-06-04,19764017,Ali Sinan,Sokol is a great host. It was one my best Airbnb experiences ever.

Le quartier laisse à désirer, mais nous n’avons toutefois pas eu de problème. Le métro se situe à 7 minutes de l’appartement, ce qui est très pratique pour se déplacer. Sokol a su répondre à toutes nos questions et il répondait très rapidement à nos messages."
30286826,467818476,2019-06-11,127330013,Carina,Nice Apartment from the rooftop you can see Acropolis. Close to restaurants and Cafes . Good place to stay
30286826,468666965,2019-06-13,63579373,Lauren,This apartment was very modern and fit our group's needs perfectly. Sokol helped with transportation from the airport and had snacks and other amenities available which made the stay even better. Check-in was very easy and there are secure lockers on site if you need to leave your bags. The apartment neighborhood seemed somewhat rough at night but was fine during the day. The building has very good security and being walking distance to the acropolis made for a great stay!
30286826,471224520,2019-06-17,229288161,Constanza,"Sokol was very gently and predisponed to help us every time, the place was very comfortable and nice."

A great place for a small group to stay on a trip to Athens. Sokol was a wonderful host with extremely fast replies, always checking that we were okay and willing to help us when we needed. Thank you!"
30286826,477870202,2019-06-29,57300361,Jordan,Sokol's place was very clean and ideally located close to the Acropolis. He was very accommodating and quick to respond. I would recommend his AirBNB to anyone staying in Athens!
30286826,478545686,2019-06-30,64815987,Hang,Host is nice and helpful. However the neighbourhood is not so good! literally you can see as long as you go out of the road!
30286826,480146432,2019-07-02,30686683,Kerry,"The room was set up just just like a top quality hotel with free tea, biscuits on greeting  as well as a welcome gift. The room was well appointed with quality fittings and everything is brand new including the lift and entry way. The entire apartment block is impeccably clean as is his apartment. Sokol checked up to see if we needed anything on a daily basis and yet gave us our privacy. It was so nice after being outside in the dusty streets to come home to a clean, modern calm environment. Wifi had easy access and cable tv was provided if required. We even had access to the rooftop area which was a nice place to get some sunset pictures and watch the lights illuminate the Acropolis on dusk."
30286826,491466456,2019-07-20,72474544,Carole,Accommodation at the top ! It's even better than the house ! All equipment is new and modern. The bedding is excellent and you feel very safe and autonomous with all the digital devices of the building.
30286826,492084734,2019-07-21,83787831,Hannah,"Great place with amazing rooftop terrace with view over the city and of the Akropolis. Very clean, easy and professional communication. We did not meet Sokol in person but he provided us with good tips."

30286826,494985051,2019-07-25,249636556,Dev,Nice little apartment in a new building. Can’t complain for the price. Sokol is a great host and is extremely attentive and quick to respond if there’s any issues. Only issue was the neighborhood it is extremely shady and I wish that was made known to us.
30286826,500448224,2019-08-02,7619447,Karen,"Sokol's apartment is a 10 minute walk to Monastiraki. It is very clean, has a well equipped kitchen, water filter ( nice touch) a great shower, all air conditioned and very comfortable. <br/>Communication was great and caring. The address itself leaves a lot to be desired but once inside this modern building it's all good. I wouldn't recommend a single female staying alone here as walking around the immediate area is a bit daunting (for a 65 year old at least) but with a companion would be fine."
30286826,501981870,2019-08-04,154949217,Bianca,Prima appartement!
30286826,504162798,2019-08-07,247761213,Nadia,Un très bel appartement bien équipé à proximité des grands sites touristiques d'Athènes. Accompagnés de nos deux jeunes enfants nous pu effectuer toutes les visites à pied. Sokol est très réactif aux messages et soucieux du bien être de ses hôtes. Le bel appartement contraste néanmoins avec un quartier très populaire mais nous n'avons rencontré aucun soucis ! Allez-y les yeux fermés !
30286826,505942998,2019-08-10,182658601,Coralie,"N'hésitez pas à séjourner chez Sokol, Très belles prestations et un hôte très attentionné.  Vue sur l'acropole à coupé le souffle de la terrasse de l'immeuble . Logement à 2 pas du centre d'Athènes. Bravo !"

30286826,511998392,2019-08-18,62144047,Theo,"Really nice appartement in a new-bild flat, that resembles a hotel room. The pros of this appartement are the key system which gives a total freedom as well as it prevents the loss of the keys, its perfect location to visit the city and its secured entrance. The balcony and the rooftop are two top elements as well.<br/>The host is great and welcoming.<br/>Strongly recommend."
30286826,513961798,2019-08-20,186492480,Jose,"Appartement de grande qualité. Mais quartier pas rassurant. À éviter pour jeune fille seule. À proximité de tout. Même si l'on s'est pas vu avec Sokol, il a été très attentif et a veille à ce que l'on soit bien installé."
30286826,518745474,2019-08-27,69168748,Monika,Tout est parfait et en plus Sokol essaie de répondre à toutes vos attentes. <br/>Ne cherchez pas ailleurs!!!! Vous avez trouvé la meilleure adresse.
30286826,519768367,2019-08-29,187128707,Paula,"Sokol is a very carefull and kind host! A welcome gift was wainting for us  and he communicated  many times to check if we need something. The appartement is sparkling clean, very well equiped with anything a guest may need. Is better than a high quality hotel while the building is very safe.  The location is  perfect for anyone wants to visit the center of Athens - less than 10 minute walk to Omonia and to Monastiraki metro stations and  about 20 minute walk to the Acropolis. I highly recommend it!"
30286826,520971938,2019-08-31,71964735,Francesco,tutto ok
30286826,521559354,2019-09-01,23979799,Mary,The location was close to all the sites. The host helped with transportation to and from the airport. Would stay again.
30286826,524580498,2019-09-06,62867314,Katharina,Unsere Erwartungen wurden noch übertroffen. Die Gegend scheint zwar auf den ersten Blick etwas dubios aber in keinster Weise war es dann unangenehm. Super Lage. Blitzsauber die Wohnung und das ganze Haus. Alles bis ins kleinste durchdacht und die Dachterrasse ein Traum. Absolut empfehlenswert. Wir haben Sokol nicht persönlich kennengelernt hatten aber stets Kontakt per Handy. Sehr bemüht um uns einen angenehmen Aufenthalt zu schaffen. Das ist ihm auf jede Fall gelungen. Alles nur wunderbar. Dankeschön
30286826,525613187,2019-09-08,193193526,Marija,Really nice check-in describtion. Only few minutes apart from the city center. The apartment was very clean and arranged in a modern style.  Stunning view to the acropolis from the roof top terrace. To sum up everything was as described. I absolutely recommend to stay at Sokols place.
30286826,527615834,2019-09-11,208347846,Fábio,"Very clean, organized and warm reception from Sokol. The communication was always fast and precise."
30286826,532666287,2019-09-20,22051375,Jaycie Caster,"Very modern and clean place. We stayed for 9 nights and it was a great home base for day trips outside of Athens as well as exploring the city by foot.  Some that's a bit more skittish might be put off by the area but it didnt bother my wife or my in laws.  The place is a bit cozy with 4 adults and a toddler. Communication was top notch.  Amenities like filtered water, gym and easy check in along with the great roof top view of the city sprawl and the acropolis makes this place a great choice.  We had a bit of an issue one night with the bedroom but they resolved it in a very professional manner.  We rented a car for a few days and we parked outside the apartment but others might not want to take as much risk.  No regrets about this place!"
30286826,535307346,2019-09-24,130151373,Chris,"The location is great, walking to agora, acropolis, a small square, iroon for food, easy to get to transportation to see other athens sites.

Well equipped kitchen, clean and stylish bathroom. The building looks like a gem in its surrounding and is used for short-term stays.  So don't expect feeling like living in someone's home but enjoy the well thought out hotel-like comfort. <br/>Checking-in and out are very easy and convenient thanks to detailed instructions."
30286826,543191113,2019-10-07,236651721,Meitzu,"Highly recommand. Good location, clean house. <br/>地點離地鐵及衛城很近,走路去吃個飯,然後散步到古蹟群及衛城都很方便｡<br/>Sokol 還幫我們預約了司機接送,我們因此在雅典有很美好的回憶｡"
30286826,547415731,2019-10-15,28439191,Nina,"We stayed at Sokol’s at the beginning of October. The welcoming was extraordinarily- from the guys who welcomed us to the neighbors:) they made sure to explain us everything and make our stay even more beautiful.  The apartment is excellent, and it was really big enough for the 4 of us. The look from the rooftop is breathtaking and you have a free gym inside the building- it’s really worth every penny that you pay.<br/>On the left side from the apartment is a family restaurant called Telis - with the best Greek food :) around the place you can find a lot of small shops :)<br/>The apartment is really great located- just a few steps from the apartment is the lively neighborhood Psiri and all the tourist attractions are within walking distance - we never used any public transportation.<br/>They sent us every day a message to make sure everything is fine and to ask us if we need anything. We really felt so welcomed. I would definitely recommend Sokol for your stay in Athens :)"

The apartment itself is close to metro and quite close to Acropolis. Another advantage is a central market located nearby. There you can by fresh seafood, olives, spices and many more. The apartment is very clean, equipped with everything you need. Super bonus is a terrace with a view. Would 100% recommend."

She makes recommendations for food, shopping, and any other needs during the visit.  The apartment is stylish and feels like a second home.  Everything is in walking distance.  The building is very secure although I was quite comfortable walking In the area at various times of night.  You can’t go wrong with this location."

You can tell that a lot of thought was given to each detail there. The thing that impressed us the most is the care Sokol showed while it was important for him to frequently ask us if everything is OK ind to make sure nothing is missing during our stay. We really appreciated it"
30286826,613876645,2020-03-03,200107951,Viktoriia,"Our stay at the apartment was wonderful.  Perfectly clean, not far from the center.  All within walking distance. Sokol is a very friendly and caring host, he provided all the information instantly.<br/>We were pleased with the infrastructure of the house itself: a gym, luggage cells, everything is clean and well maintained.  Besides, it is worth highlighting the terrace on the rooftop — we didn’t want to leave it.<br/>Highly recommend this apartment."

Thanks a lot to host as he was flexible for check-in time for us and  helped with finding a taxi-driver (as we checked out at 5 a.m). Everything in his description (all details) is true, and the apartment was much more better then we expected!"

30287707,400500141,2019-01-12,184405859,Andrea,"Beautiful and stylish place. Up to 15 minutes walking distance to everything you need to visit - you will save a lot on public transport. Location in the center with many restaurants and taverns nearby. The apartment itself is perfect for two people, very cosy and feels like a true home. The rooftop terrace with a breathtaking view was a cherry on top. Special thanks to Sokol for his hospitality, super-quick replies and willingness to accommodate all our wishes. Late night flight was not a problem since we were able to leave our bags in the building. Absolutely our No. 1 choice for next time in Athens!"

The location is very central, but typical Athens, meaning that the neighborhood is a bit edgy, esp. at night. But hey, you're in Athens; just roll with it. Enjoy"

The place is stylish, cozy, very clean, and Sokol is very nice, he asked about us all the time, get us a little gift. The street where the apartment is located is not so friendly at first, but you can get used to it, and it's 5 minutes from everything, so it's okay. I'll definitely recommend this place, if you are in Athens."

At all times he was concerned to know if things were right or in case we needed something. He offered us services of a friend for the transfers who was also really charming. <br/>The apartment is exceptional, everything works perfectly and is very nice. <br/>We are very grateful, we recommend it 100% and we would choose it again. Thank you Sokol!!!!"

30287707,423456402,2019-03-14,33421413,Candace,"This place was amazing! A beautiful apartment in an amazing city. Had everything you needed for a good city break - comfy bed, crisp sheets, good wifi, good shower, coffee machine and table which was perfect to work from. The apartment was bright and airy and the sun was streaming in. The only tiny tiny issue was the street outside was a little Dodgy...but a few minutes walk you are in the centre, so not too much of an issue. Really great value aswell. The host was great in checking in with me and was very responsive to messages."
30287707,426851095,2019-03-22,74391129,Sanyukta,It’s as perfect as described and given in pics.. please use the transfer option given by Sokol it will be very convenient rather than taking the metro.. the place has everything you need and very accessible to places around and a terrace with acropolis view...

30287707,442699925,2019-04-24,234866259,Nataly,"Nice little building, and the room was nice and clean. Sokol was very attentive and made our trip better by recommending his friend to pick us up from airport and drop us off. Only bad thing is the neighborhood wasn’t all that great."
30287707,443515159,2019-04-26,100080829,Marios,"the flat was as on the pictures, clean and  did the job for a short stay. Good value for its money.The building was safe itself but it is located in a dodgy area, specially at night, near Koumoundourou Square. Unfortunately was not easy to understand this before the booking. It is very central though so it is ideal for going around the city."
30287707,449631117,2019-05-07,18583989,Lauren,"My husband & I stayed at Sokols unit for 5 days & had a fabulous time. Sokol is so hospitable & is so quick to reply to any question we had. Although we never met in person, he checked on us each night to make sure we were doing ok. I highly recommend booking an airport pick up & drop off thru Sokol. It made it SO easy & stress free having that arranged for us. <br/><br/>The checkin process was so simple, apartment was very clean & updated & we felt very safe with key code entry & security cameras. The location is about 12 minute walk from the center of town where there is food, shopping & all the major Athens sites. Overall, we had a fantastic stay & we would highly recommend staying here. You won’t regret it! Thanks again, Sokol!! We appreciate you! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
30287707,450717627,2019-05-10,99982997,Clémentine,"Bon appartement, conforme à la description. Sokol est aux petits soins, l’appartement est à quelques minutes à pied de Monastiraki, ce qui nous a permis de tout faire à pied !"
30287707,451667906,2019-05-12,8323502,Maike,great place for amazing value in athens center. very clean and the host is very nice. would definitely go there again! thanks
30287707,453181752,2019-05-15,156022243,Linda-Marie,Sokol is a lovely host and makes sure that you are comfortable and that all is in order with your stay.
30287707,455041493,2019-05-19,30784757,Florian,"Sokol is a good host, very friendly and responds fast. The check in was really easy and we found the apartment really fast. It's close to the station (around 5 min) directly in the centre, you get there easily from the airport,  it's in a 20 min walking distance to the acropolis and other sights. The apartment is very clean and has everything you need, just the bed was a bid hard but ok for some days. There is a sweet tavern around the corner, I can recommend."
30287707,455792768,2019-05-20,201093731,Melanie,"Sokol was a very nice host, very responsive to our messages and questions we had. The apartment was very clean and secure considering the appearance of the neighbourhood at first glance. The rooftop terrace was lovely in the evening for a drink or a quick bite. The only reason why I am not giving this location a five star is because we felt unsafe walking around the neighbourhood day/night."
30287707,457475596,2019-05-24,15611619,Luigi,"The flat was clean and cozy, in the center close to everything we needed for our quick trip. Close to metro and train station as well. Sokol was very helpful. Totally recommended!"
30287707,458536218,2019-05-26,78917341,Valéry,"Nous avons adoré la proximité des attractions de la ville et les réponses rapides de Sokol, en plus de la possibilité de laisser nos bagages en sécurité dans le bâtiment. Seul point ""négatif"" est certaines rues près du logement qui sont très achalandées de jour comme de soir et qui nous ont fait faire quelques détours à pied pour les éviter. Autrement, bien situé par rapport aux différents moyens de transport. Nous le recommanderons."
30287707,459943861,2019-05-28,21978006,Sara,"We were only in Athens for 24 hours but Sokol’s place was in a great location for where we wanted to go. Yes, the neighborhood itself wasn’t the nicest/cleanest looking, but it was safe, quiet, and a 10-20 minute walk to all the different areas we wanted to go to. The apartment itself was gorgeous, quiet, and I would definitely go back and stay there again. Sokol was an amazing host - super responsive, helpful with all my questions, and we were able to store our bags in the building after checkout so we could continue to explore Athens."
30287707,461265078,2019-05-31,139911558,Regina,The place is awesome and Sokol did really everything that we feel good!
30287707,462298630,2019-06-02,25394095,Brenna,"Sokol’s place was clean and well put-together. It had all the amenities a hotel would offer. He arranged a driver to pick us up from the airport which was incredibly helpful! The location was absolutely perfect, we could walk everywhere."
30287707,463458637,2019-06-03,35788049,Angela,"Sokol is one of the best hosts we've ever had, and his apartment was lovely. He went the extra mile with thoughtful touches throughout the apartment and occasional messages to make sure we had everything we needed.<br/><br/>The location of the apartment is good for access to restaurants, shopping, and sightseeing. Be aware of your surroundings in the couple of blocks it takes to walk to the center. It's not perhaps the best of neighborhoods. The apartment, however, is very secure.<br/><br/>Make sure to enjoy the rooftop at sunset!"
30287707,465058342,2019-06-07,74028457,Delaney,Sokol reached out multiple times to ensure that we were enjoying our stay and wondering if we needed anything. Very thoughtful and the apartment was lovely with several kind touches. Would love to return here again!
30287707,466393078,2019-06-09,241858833,Louise,A very helpful and supportive host who responded to any questions very quickly.
30287707,467162322,2019-06-10,7487770,Sabina,"Sokol's apartment in Athens was very comfortable and clean, with nice added touches. He was very communicative and always available to answer any questions. <br/>The area arriving at night was a little seedy but during the day it was fine and very close to everything.<br/>Recommended."
30287707,472668260,2019-06-20,118401855,Blair,"We had a great experience staying at Sokols home in Athens, the home was clean and he was very quick and clear with his communication."
30287707,475902120,2019-06-25,3148010,Kate,"Sokol’s communication with us was amazing. Check in was super simple- he provides a very easy and thorough guide so there is no gray area. Having a place to store our bags when we arrived was SO GREAT. We were able to explore a full day in Athens before check in without worrying about our bags. Very helpful. The apartment was super clean, perfectly located. AC provided sweet relief :) Sokol checked in several times to make sure we were enjoying our stay and if we needed anything. Wonderful host! Would absolutely stay here again."
30287707,476404745,2019-06-26,247230449,Mandeera,"The apartment is very modern and well kept and the host's thoughtful touches and quick responses to queries made us very comfortable. I loved the location as one was walking distance from the branded stores,the flea markets as well as the local shops."
30287707,476803503,2019-06-27,21164618,Gina,"The building is very secure, and the interior is impeccable (clean, modern, full amenities). The main sites are walkable, but be aware that the specific location of this AirBnB is in a less tourist-friendly and less safe area (the apartment building is a clear mark of gentrification, and stands out among its neighboring buildings). Would not recommend this location for women traveling alone, or anyone with very late arrivals or very early morning departures, as we were accosted (grabbed aggressively by a man and asked for money) walking to the metro stop in Monastiraki early in the morning. Would give 5 stars for the accommodations themselves, but 2 stars for the location."
30287707,477870954,2019-06-29,198758190,Effy,The apartment is perfectly clean and comfortable and ample space for a couple to relax. After the initial uneasiness at the grungy location we actually enjoyed walking around and looking at the wall graffiti and the location is very close to great little cafes on the way to Monastiraki. We would enjoy staying here again for longer than the 2 nights that we did on this trip. Sokol also responded promptly to our questions as well as arranging taxi to the airport. Thank you Sokol!
30287707,478529960,2019-06-30,27071608,Isabeau,"Clean, great shower, comfortable bed, and great location for walking around central Athens. We would recommend!"

30287707,484091298,2019-07-08,132239578,Isa,"If you are looking for a place in Athens with perfect facilities at a valuable price, book this place now! There is a gym, rooftop, washer, and pretty much everything you need in the apartment. Sokol was very kind to leave us welcome snacks and a lovely trinket to remember our stay at Athens. On top of this, he was very accommodating and checked on us daily. Def would book again! Just take note though that the property is not located in the ritziest of areas. Didn’t cause us any trouble but like all travels abroad, be vigilant. Def would book again!"
30287707,485160898,2019-07-10,3038756,Roberto,"Excellent Studio , very clean and really worthwhile and enjoyable"

30287707,493768658,2019-07-23,24194492,Jess,"Sokols apartment is amazing!! Theres a rooftop terrace, a gym and a big fancy massage chair! The apartment itself is modern, clean and beautifully decorated! Sokol is so lovely and we absolutely would stay here again. Its very central and in a good area of Athens. Fantastic value for money. Thank you for having us!"
30287707,494291631,2019-07-24,30015223,Hayk,"The apartment was great (very clean, stylish, fully equipped, helpful and very responsive host, complimentary snacks, help with fixing a ride to airport etc) and we enjoyed our stay!  It is located in city center which is also great and in terms of closeness to main tourist attractions with few minutes promenade to Acropolis, Plaka etc.. However it is on the backstreets of Monastiraki square which feels like very unsafe and grimy area. During few minutes walk from metro station you are going through beautiful cozy cafes and bars near Monastiraki to dirty noisy ghetto-like busy street markets somewhere in Pakistan, with no tourists at all. We stayed only half a day, arrived in evening and checked out early morning, so we didn't spend much time in the neighborhood and in fact it might be alright during the day, but we felt quite uneasy walking home through there in the evening. Very good for a short stay. Won't recommend for women who travel alone and people with shaky nerves.  Will recommend to everyone else in general."
30287707,496122510,2019-07-27,133326782,Ariane,"L'appartement est très confortable et très propre, bien décoré et bien équipé. Nous avons passé un super séjour."

30287707,503492939,2019-08-06,120307256,Sam,My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay at Sokol’s place. The apartment was perfect for us and we could easily walk to the nearby sites. <br/><br/>In addition to the accomodation Sokol printed and delivered to us our flight boarding pass which was not expected but greatly appreciated.<br/>Highly recommend staying at this accomodation!
30287707,504793105,2019-08-08,282569125,Valérie,"L'appartement est très propre et bien équipé, le lit est confortable. Proche du quartier sympathique de Monastikari. <br/>Sokol est un bon hôte. <br/>Bon rapport qualité/prix"
30287707,506099005,2019-08-10,85961365,Daniel,"Newly renovated and stylish apartment with beautiful views of the city on the top level of the complex. The apartment was clean, well appointed and as described and the hosts were quick and helpful in their responses.<br/><br/>Although the apartment complex is very secure, there are more than a few shady characters floating around on the street nearby. Perhaps avoid if you’re a single female traveller."
30287707,506913946,2019-08-11,6825926,Ruth,"Clean, modern, bachelor flat about a 15 min walk from Monastiraki square. While the area surrounding the square is great, you must walk through a shady area as others have mentioned to get to and from the apartment.  It is a very rough area, would be unsafe for single travelers."

30287707,513281788,2019-08-19,59034858,Emily,"Sokol’s place is wonderful! We had a great stay in Athens with his apartment being well located near many different areas and a short walk to the local metro station. Location is nearby a tough part of town, especially at night, but we never once felt unsafe. Sokol did a great job communicating with us to ensure we could navigate safely and successfully. We would recommend staying here!"
30287707,514467250,2019-08-21,16135994,Maria Giulia,"Sokol is a great host, caring and always available. His place is stylish, super-clean, with a great view from the roof terrace. It’s right in the center, we could walk everywhere. At the same time it’s absolutely quiet!<br/>The mattress is very good, we slept very well. We’re going to choose Sokol any other time!"

The apartment was clean, and close to the sites. The only problem was that the area was a little dodgy (very dirty and our taxi driver said it was a litter dangerous). Otherwise we had a pleasant stay!"
30287707,519654468,2019-08-29,79012081,Rachel,"The apartment itself was very nice, clean and exactly as in the pictures. We had some minor issues with heating /ac the first night which Sokol sorted as soon as we told him. Our only major comment would be on the location :on the plus side it is very central to metro/bus transport, and main attractions such as the acropolis are in walking distance, however the neighbourhood seems quite rough, and we felt unsafe to walk there at night. Sokol was very quick to reply with any comments or questions and was generally very helpful"
30287707,520227512,2019-08-30,20162106,John And Abbie,Sokol’s place was a 5 star experience from start to finish! It was clean and the stay was ver organized which was excellent as we arrived late and were very tired. We almost wished we could have stayed longer.
30287707,523220593,2019-09-03,156623999,Sabine,"It is a very nice apartment, just a few minutes to the center if Athen. Sokol stays in contact with you and is very helpful- thanks a lot"

On the 4th floor, we felt safe and secure, as the main building entrance has a code operated front door and the entrance to the apartment has a good lock.  Good lift.  The immediate surrounding area is somewhat run down, though quite safe in the day time.<br/><br/>If you are looking for somewhere to lay your head, and from which the sights and attractions are accessible on foot, this place fits the bill.  The apartment is well decorated and clean.  Sokol is a genial and helpful host.  We never physically met him but he was always quick to respond by text and anxious to make our stay as pleasant as possible.<br/><br/>The rooftop terrace is a great place to unwind in the evening, with spectacular views over the city, including the Acropolis.  It is also a good place to meet other residents - a meeting point.<br/><br/>Recommended."

Informations claires et précises envoyées une fois la réservation faites sur comment arriver, comment récupérer la clé, bonnes adresses restaurants, bar ect... <br/>seul point négatif la rue est mal fréquentée (SDF, détritus, ...) personnellement ça ne nous a pas posé de problème."

We were short walks away from amazing food, shopping and the main tourist attractions of the city. Sokol was easy to contact, was very helpful arranging our transport to and from the apartment on our request, and made the check-in process so easy. We had a fantastic stay, and we recommend booking Sokol’s place for your stay in Athens!"
30287707,536727512,2019-09-27,60394223,Allison,"Stayed at this beautiful apartment for our final night in Greece.

It’s sparkling clean and it has everything you could possibly need. I honestly don’t think you can beat the price either.

La rue laisse un peu à désirer mais c est écrit dans l annonce et l immeuble et l appart sont eux très propres. Le rooftop est incroyable avec une vue magnifique sur l acropole. Sokol est réactif, clair et plein d attention pour que l on passe un bon moment. La salle de sport accessible à tous est appréciable aussi.

The place was as described and nice, with all we needed and it is well located, not far from Monastiraki and surrounded by good bars and food. Maybe the only con is the street where the building is located, we never had any problem but it felt a bit insecure at times. Overall a great experience nevertheless, thanks Sokol!!"

30287707,603349820,2020-02-09,35775115,Marc,"Great place. Feels brand new. Very clean. I was there the coldest week of the year (4 C) and the heating worked very well. Comfortable bed, nice shower, good WIFI. Secure building. Just a 5-minute walk from the lively neighborhood around Monastiraki square. The streets for a couple of blocks around the building have quite a few immigrant men standing around, but i never felt unsafe; I rather got the impression they were trying to stay out of trouble. I hope i can stay there the next time i visit Athens."

The house was sparkling clean and coffee, buscuits, fresh water and marmalade was there to welcome you in Athens. The zone is very central and there are plenty of places where to eat and very close to all the transports even if walking is the best option as everything is close by. Amazing view to the Acropolis and very nice terrance, is a plus! Thanks for hosting me Sokol, if I will be in Athens again I will definitely come back!"

En realidad son 15 minutos en metro, por lo que está bastante más lejos. El apartamento está bien, aunque las fotos no son del todo fieles. Tiene buenos alrededores en cuanto a compras, alimentación y tal, aunque al principio es un poco difícil de encontrar y la calle no parece muy segura pero no hubo ningún problema. No hay microondas pero sí toallas y mantas. Al menos fue atenta y nos dejó el apartamento calentito para cuando llegáramos. Eso sí, nunca la vimos, nos dejó la llave en la caja de seguridad y ya."

I stayed here with a friend and there were two bedrooms with more than enough space. The doors in the apartment are all sliding doors which I thought was very stylish. The apartment is walking distance from a grocery store, a gas station, a bit of night life and late night eats. Akrivi herself was very warm, responded quickly to any concerns and left notes inside the apartment to help navigate the city as well as the use of the apartment. 10/10 would stay here again"

Ο χώρος είναι αρκετά άδειος, με τοίχους που έχουν να βαφτούν πολύ καιρό και με έπιπλα μεγάλης ηλικίας και με φθορά. Στα θετικά ότι το διαμέρισμα είχε καλή θέρμανση (κλιματιστικά και αερόθερμα) και είχαμε μια ήρεμη διαμονή. Το σπίτι χρειάζεται άμεση ανανέωση ή ανακαίνιση.

The neighborhood is easy accessible by public transport.<br/>The apartment is new renovated, so everything is clean and new. The kitchen is fine equiped. <br/>There is no place to put your clothes neither in the living room nor in the bedroom - no shelfs, no wardrobe rail. <br/>During the winter the apartment is quite cold. There is no heating besides the air conditioner with heating program but only in the bedroom and in the corridor.<br/>If you expect nice view of the Acropolis, you will be desapointed. <br/>Nevertheless we recommend this apartment."

Βέβαια ήταν έντονο το αίσθημα της υγρασίας καθώς η πολυκατοικία είναι παλιά και η είσοδος της μύριζε αρκετά άσχημα. Στο μπάνιο υπάρχει ένα παράθυρο που βλέπει στο φωταγωγό,με σίτα που χρειάζεται επισκευή. Η τοποθεσία είναι ιδανική για όσους θέλουν να εξερευνήσουν το ιστορικό κέντρο της Αθήνας με τα πόδια.

30292659,495420030,2019-07-26,81853271,Rania,"The apartment is great and cozy. Photos make it look much nicer. Overall it’s good value. Very close to metro station. But not easy to climb up street with luggage to come and go to airport. After walking around all day, last thing you want is to push yourself up a hill to go back to apartment. <br/><br/>The room is decent size, but no dresser or mirror. No hangers to hang clothes or even a chair to place personal items. Just two small night tables, not much you can put on them. <br/><br/>Bathroom is small and water always flooding the floor during shower. The curtain not wide enough to cover the tub all around. <br/><br/>The kitchen is great, had all the amenities and tools you need for a short stay. No freezer though, just fridge. So not possible to make ice or even buy it and preserve it. <br/><br/>Super clean and that’s what I loved about it the most. Air conditioning in room and in living room. And also very quite, you can get a good sleep. <br/><br/>Host was very kind to arrange early luggage drop off. I appreciated that very much."

Τριγύρω πολλά μαγαζιά για πρωινό και σούπερ μάρκετ.<br/>Το σπίτι είχε σχεδόν τα πάντα. Θα βόλευε ιδιαίτερα αν υπήρχε ένας ολόσωμος καθρέφτης κάπου στο χωλ ή μέσα στο υπνοδωμάτιο, μία πολύ απλή τοστιέρα στον εξοπλισμό της κουζίνας και περισσότερα κρεμαστάρια στην ντουλάπα (είχε μόνο ένα).<br/>Η καθαριότητα ήταν άψογη. <br/>Το Wifi ταχύτατο.<br/>Ένα μικρό φάουλ (αλλά όχι καθοριστικής σημασίας) ήταν τα ξεχασμένα σεντόνια και πετσέτες των προηγούμενων ενοίκων μέσα στην ντουλάπα του υπνοδωματίου.<br/>Η διαμονή μας ήταν πολύ ευχάριστη!<br/>Ευχαριστούμε!"

You should note that the Kitchen is very Well equipped, however the apartment is lacking a storage place for clothes and a full sized mirror.<br/>The host privided us with all the necessary information and was quick to respond to any questions we had.<br/>However, there is a construction taking place, which can be really disturbing. As we were not in the apartment during the day, we did not really mind, But be sure to ask the host about this."

Кровать с подогревом! <br/> Я приехала в Афины в час ночи. И волновалась, как я доберусь, если вдруг там не будет такси. Но Сула встретила меня на автобусной остановке.<br/> До всех лостопримечательностей Афин можно дойти пешком. Например, в пятнадцати минутах ходу--место, где был Ликей Аристотеля. Рядом Византийский музей и т. д.<br/>Квартира Сулы  идеально подходит для таких путешествий! Спасибо замечательной хозяйке!"

The location is very good - close to the main attractions, shops and restaurants (about 15-20 minutes on foot to the Acropolis entrance, about 2 minutes to the closest grocery shop). We were in contact with Esmeralda. She is very nice and answered all our questions and problems really quickly.  You can always feel safe because of the codes to the bulding and to the apartment, there is a place where you can store your luggage for a while after check-out and the whole building is well maintained.

The minimal living was perfect. There was easy access into the apartment, and the appliances were top of the line.  The apartment was so quiet and sound- proof.  The absolute greatest parts of the apartment were the very large decks that wrapped around the apartment.  Also, we traveled with our 20 month old that enjoyed the indoor play-space so much, we were there to play everyday.  It was a very quick <10 minute walk to the Thissio metro station and main eating places around the Acropolis.  There were also cafes and bakeries even closer to the apartment.  From this location, taxis are very easy to hail for access to any part of Athens you want to visit.  The host was very nice, easy to contact and gave good direction for the visit.  She also arranged transportation to and from the airport for us.  What a wonderful visit we had to Athens!"

The apartment was in the dust. The cleaning was not properly cleaned. The terrace lacked furniture. The flowers dried up in pots. The soulholder was broken. The sofa was in spots. We spent the whole evening addressing the issues of living. The owner didn't offer us a solution to the problem, only offered to cancel the reservation. Only through Airbnb support did we resolve the issues."

We got a couple +2 family to the apartment. The check went easily, the explanations were great. The office that handles the property responds quickly.

There were mineral water, and basic condiments such as oil, salt and pepper available. Same for hot water for showers + toiletries. Esmeralda helped us to arrange airport transfer and was waiting for us when we arrived. She also replied quickly to queries during the lead-up time. The apartment is located in a very local neighborhood with great eateries and bars nearby. The shopping belt is just a 15-min walk away. We could do laundry and work out at the gym easily.

The shared area was perfect, because it had a huge couch and table and chairs for my whole group to hang out in and make plans for what we wanted to do that day. Also there is a pamphlet when you first get in that gives you information all about the city, recommendations on restaurants and etc. The hosts were also excellent. They were very prompt in getting back to me on any questions I had."
30304976,455070057,2019-05-19,257422339,Niki,"Τοποθεσία πολύ καλή, κοντά στο κέντρο και όλα τα σημεία ενδιαφέροντος. Καθαρός, προσεγμένος και μοντέρνος χώρος. Άνοιγμα εξώπορτας και διαμερίσματος με κωδικό χωρίς ανάγκη κλειδιών. Πολύ άνετη διαμονή ειδικά λόγω των 3 μπάνιων. Ήσυχη περιοχή, μικρή ταλαιπωρία για να βρεις πάρκινγκ στο δρόμο."

It’s great for groups who want to have a bit of privacy, because each room has a bathroom. Location is great. Shops and city centre is nearby. Host Esmeralda was helpful and very kind. I definitely recommend this place, it felt like home."
30304976,464634192,2019-06-06,58980413,Kemi,"The Hercules residence is a newly completed (Spring 2019), totally rehabbed building where all units are used specifically for AirBnB rentals.  This makes it feel more like a all suite hotel or executive housing.  The front door and each apartment door have keypad locks so no need to worry about picking up keys.  (This also turned out to be great when different people wanted to come and go at different times - no worry about who has the keys when).  There is also a brand new elevator (unusual!) which was great for bringing all our bags up and down.  <br/><br/>The apartment is tastefully decorated (Ikea style) with all new appliances, kitchen supplies, etc. Everything is new and very clean.  There is a very large, wraparound porch with cafe tables that is great for relaxing with coffee in the morning or drinks in the evening.<br/><br/>Two of the three bedrooms have their own bathrooms, with a third bathroom in the hallway.  Having 3 bathrooms with a 3 bedroom apartment is very unusual and very nice for a family or group all trying to get ready at the same time.  The bathrooms have very nice tile and glass shower stalls.  All bedrooms have individual AC units, as does the main living area, so the apartment was always comfortable for everyone.  (One of the AC units was malfunctioning during 2 of our 3 nights, but Esmeralda had a technician come out the next day to fix it).  All the windows/sliding doors are double paned and shut out all the outside noise.<br/><br/>There are fantastic amenities in the basement:  a very large gym with modern equipment, a free laundry room with all new washers and detergent provided, a business center area with printer, and a really cool kids play room with a multilevel climbing structure that would be amazing for families with younger kids who wake up too early.  I've never seen an Airbnb with that level of amenities.  <br/><br/>The location is in a residential neighborhood with kids walking to school in the morning, families out on their balconies, etc. There are a couple restaurants, a bakery, butcher shop, and two supermarkets within a few blocks  - but this is not a tourist area with tons of restaurants lining the street.    It is about a 5 minute walk to the Gazi neighborhood with tons of restaurants, bars, clubs, and galleries.  It's about 15-20 min walk to the Acropolis and other sites around it.<br/><br/>Esmeralda was our ""property hostess"" and was very responsive before and during our stay.  Since that appears to be her full time role, she was able to provide almost 24hr responsiveness.  We would definitely stay at one of these apartments again and recommend it highly for visiting families or groups who want a clean, modern, nicely decorated space with hotel-like amenities in a residential neighborhood rather than a typical hotel experience."
30304976,467241393,2019-06-10,74494453,Tammy,"We just came back from a 5 day stay in Athens and I wanted to share the news about this place with everyone.  In one word it is AMAZING! the rooms are beautiful and spacious, the attention to details is superb, the check-in was super easy and when we got there we had a small folder with all the necessary tips for the visiting tourist. Not shown in the pictures is a huge porch, which was such a bonus. When it cooled down in the evening, we loved sitting there. The apartment is very close to all the major attractions and upbeat neighborhoods. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Athens who wants to feel like a local for a little while."

Mary and Esmeralda were absolutely phenomenal — I would highly recommend their place if you’re visiting Athens!<br/><br/>This apartment complex is completely renovated and everything is brand new. You have all the amenities you could want (refrigerator, AC, WiFi, washer/dryer in building, gym, microwave, oven, dishes, etc) and our apartment had 3 bathrooms (one in each master suite) and a larger one in the common area. The apartment is also very close to local shops and it was easier for us to walk over and grab fresh groceries/snacks whenever we wanted. <br/><br/>Communication was flawless, the check in process was very simple and we were able to access our apartment without having to deal with lockbox issues, etc (which was very nice after a long international flight). <br/><br/>They also created a really helpful folder with information on local restaurants, shopping, historical sites and more. We leveraged that to plan our site seeing activities. There were many thoughtful touches throughout the apartment and it made our experience that much nicer. <br/><br/>If you’re visiting Athens, and especially if you’re a first-timer I would highly recommend staying here!"
30304976,486761947,2019-07-13,31527752,Lisa,"The Hercules apartment was great. Close enough to walk to the sites and restaurants, yet in a quiet neighbourhood. <br/>Very clean and extremely comfortable for three couples. Have no hesitation to recommend."
30304976,493194337,2019-07-22,221394811,Michelle,We loved our stay at the Hercules residence. It exceeded all our expectations and the amenities they had were amazing. We were able to use the kid play area and laundry area during our stay which was a great bonus for us and our family. The views and location were also great. The kitchen had everything anyone could need to make meals and be able to relax with a feeling like you were at home.  It was less than a 15 minute walk to the Acropolis and they had many markets and bakeries within a 5 minute walk. The residence was extremely clean and well prepared for our stay. Our host Mary helped us arrange transportation multiple times for our family to visit many locations in Athens and we were able to get several useful tips from her. Would recommend this apartment to anyone traveling to Athens! Will stay in again when we come back next time!
30304976,498626481,2019-07-30,221394811,Michelle,Stayed here for our second time and as before it is a great apartment and residence. Kept clean and great location to everything. Will stay here again on our next trip in the upcoming years! Mary and her co hosts do a great job and help in any way they can. Would recommend the residence to anyone!
30304976,504215673,2019-08-07,26474095,Louis,"We were positively surprised by how new and neat the apparement was. In fact the whole building is new. We came back each midday-day during the peak temperature  moment to have a nap (August in Athens was really hot), and be in a cooler environment. Air-Co in every room worked well. At -1 we found as said 2 washing machines and 2 dryers in the shared clothing cleaning facilities, and my son told me the gym was really cool.<br/><br/>Neighbourhood is relaxed, with all the needed basic food facilities.  Croissants in the morning are one block away. At evening, we found some nice restaurants within 10 minutes walking. We often just walked to the different sites in Athens. Agora, Thissio, Klapa are really in walking distance (30 minutes) And we always had a secure feeling. Even late at night.<br/><br/>Professional taking care by the host. They arranged for pick-up and drop at the airport by a very decent taxi service.<br/><br/>We wish Mary good success with the renting of this lovely apartment. Pictures on the site give a good impression of what you will find.<br/><br/>Louis Nef & family."

30304976,531771850,2019-09-18,62894250,Lana,We had a great time staying at the Hercules residence. It was easy to check in and was lovely and clean. It was further away from the main city than I realised but it was close and within walking distance to Thissio and the Ancient Agora along with the many restaurants in those areas. It was also lovely to have air-conditioning in every room.
30304976,537121562,2019-09-28,191010205,Claudia,"This large, modern apartment was within walking distance of the Acropolis and the other main attractions of ancient Athens. Sparkling clean and very secure. Located in a neighborhood of apartments and small business; a block away are a bakery and a coffee house.  This is a modern structure tucked into older building which is the best of both worlds. Highly recommended."

The living space is comfortable for three people. The balcony is fantastic and has a good sized area adjoining the lounge/kitchen and it also wraps around the apartment to one of the bedrooms - lots of space and lots of sun (we went late October 2020 and the weather was consistently around 25degrees).<br/><br/>The apartment was clean and it is keypad entry on the main exterior door and on the apartment itself: this made it easy to check in as we arrived late in the evening and so there was no hassle with keys or meeting the host.<br/><br/>The host was friendly and responded to requests in good time.<br/><br/>As above, we would definitely stay here again - thank you."

The decoration is tasteful and the balcony is very nice.<br/><br/>The Kerameikos metro station in nearby (less than 10 minutes walk).

We used the Gym (in the basement) which was good (has also airco). <br/><br/>A small supermarket is nearby, a bigger one is a few minutes walking distance (I recommend the bigger one).<br/><br/>Windows have shutters and mosquito screens,: good. You can hear some street noise though (also the green metro line which runs not far from the appartment building) , although there is little traffic at night<br/><br/>Communication with Esmeralde was great and access using the codes worked fine.

It is fresh and new, with great heat and air conditioning, shower with plenty of hot water, and comfortable beds (even the sofa bed!). Washing machines and dryers are available in the building for no extra charge, with laundry detergent provided. A helpful welcome guide helped us find a cafe, bakery, and grocery store nearby. The location was ideal for us, in a quiet neighborhood just outside the tourist area, which meant walking a few more minutes to the major sights. There are two metro stops within a 10-minute walk. Drivers can find parking on the street near the apartment without much trouble. The apartment was plenty large enough for our family of five, but a group of adults might find it a bit tight. We enjoyed our stay very much and would certainly stay again the next time we come to Athens!"

Everything was spotlessly clean when we arrived and the instructions we were given made it easy to get into the  building/room, even though we arrived quite late. We would recommend using  the transfer service Esmeralda arranged for a seamless ride to and from the airport for a reasonable price.<br/><br/>The only issue we had was the door seemed to not lock properly on one of the days, but it was fixed promptly. We felt safe in the area anyway (only those staying in the apartment block would have had access) so it wasn’t a big problem.<br/><br/>Aside from the apartment itself, the gym and playground in the basement were a nice touch even if we didn’t use them ourselves. There is also a printer here in case you need to print any important documents, as well as locker cages to store any luggage - a necessity for those with a later flight!<br/><br/>Overall, we would highly recommend the Hercules residence as a base for a trip to Athens, whether you’re there for a couple days or a couple weeks. No matter how long you’re staying, it will be easy for you to discover the beauty that Athens has :)"

But those are super minor, and otherwise, comfortable beds, plenty of space for a family of 4. it was 37deg when we were visiting Athens and it was s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) great to be able to turn on the ac and cool off after spending time in the heat! :) thank you for a wonderful stay in Athens!"

The apartment has so many nice touches missing from hotels and other apartments. LCD tvs in lounge and bedrooms with Netflix, prime, you tube etc was a nice touch. Frustrates me hotels can't get this but right. Comfortable beds, plenty of bedding and pillows. Safes in both bedrooms, both sides of the apartment have a Balcony which is nice. Full kitchen so self catering here would be easy.  Check in process was a breeze and communication with hosts was great.<br/><br/>Location is good. A little outside the main centre but that's not a bad thing and it's just a 10 min walk to the metro and supermarkets and restaurants are on the doorstep.<br/><br/>I would have no hesitation in recommending this place or staying there again if I returned to Athens."

It is however run as an Airbnb without hotel services on site, make up the room etc. When stayed at winter the temperature was very low and whilst it listed having heating it only had A/C with hot air function which was not sufficient to warm up the room.

Ένα τσακ παραπάνω στην καθαριότητα θα ήθελα. Επίσης στο mail που μου έστειλε η εταιρεία θα ήθελα να γράφει ότι πρέπει να ανοίξω θερμοσίφωνα για μπάνιο, γιατί στα περισσότερα που έχω πάει έχουν ζεστό αυτόματα. Το μεγάλο foul όμως ήταν η πρόσβαση στο διαμέρισμα. Φτάνοντας την πρώτη μέρα μετά από πολύωρο ταξίδι και καύσωνα έξω, έπρεπε να περιμένω 40 λεπτά (!) απέξω απτην πόρτα του διαμερίσματος για να καταλήξουμε τελικά ότι δεν δουλεύει κανένας από τους κωδικούς που μου έδιναν. Στη συνέχεια αφού μου δώσανε τον κωδικό για να πάρω το φυσικό κλειδί, αυτό κόλλησε στην πόρτα!!<br/>Τελικά με μετακίνησαν στο κάτω όροφο σε άλλο διαμέρισμα το οποίο ήταν οκ δεν υπήρχε πρόβλημα ως προς αυτό. Ο κωδικός δε δούλεψε άλλη μια φορά κατά τη διάρκεια της διαμονής μου ( στο νέο διαμέρισμα) και πάλι έπρεπε να επικοινωνήσω με το τηλεφωνικό κέντρο για να μου δώσουν άλλο κωδικό. <br/>Πρέπει να γίνει κάτι με το σύστημα εισόδου, είναι απαράδεκτο. Θέλω να επισημάνω ότι οι κοπέλες στο τηλέφωνο ήταν εξυπηρετικότατες και επαγγελματίες και η κριτική μου δεν αφορά σε καμία περίπτωση αυτές. Αφορά το προβληματικό σύστημα εισόδου."

Communication with Olala homes was perfect and they did everything they could for an early check in and were very helpful. Would highly recommend for two people wanting to spend some time in Athens.

It is perfect for whom are not interested in interacting with the owner and only look for a nice clean functional place where to stay.<br/>Despite the fact that I gave 5 stars to all the categories I choose to give a global 4 stars to the accomodation because to me something is missing to make it special to reach 5 stars even if it is clean, I have received all the instructions to get in....and the location is good. Well organized but 4 STARS. <br/>If you are looking for a good  place and not an experience  this is perfect !"

I had to wait for half an hour for maintenance.<br/><br/>They didn't have an answer as to how cleaning didn't see that both locks to the flat were broken. <br/><br/>Being in a very central part in Athens, I obviously did not feel safe, so take that as you will."

30314696,484654725,2019-07-09,72095433,Chris,"We booked last minute the night before and the communication was excellent.  Loved the self check in and we were even able to check in at noon instead of later which was wonderful.<br/><br/>The penthouse apartment was clean, stylish and all around perfect for what we needed - 1 night in Athens.  We are a family of 5 adults and with 2 bedrooms and 2 baths, it was perfect.  The living area was somewhat cramped with all of us so I wouldn't have wanted to stay more than a few nights, but if the weather was not so hot, we would've used the 3 great terraces a bit more, thus increasing the usable space.  <br/><br/>The host left juice, coffee, beer and sesame sticks for us upon arrival. They also left a great guidebook for the apartment and things to do in Athens.  Such a nice touch to welcome us to the city.  <br/><br/>It's a cool, clean apartment in a great location at a very reasonable price."

On est à pied de beaucoup de lieux à visiter, de restaurants, de magasins et aussi proche de deux métros et d'une station de taxi. L'appartement est très propre et fonctionnel. Tout le nécessaire est là (plus de quoi boire en arrivant…Merci !). On a peu utilisé les terrasses à cause de la chaleur, mais c'est tout de même agréable le matin ou en fin de journée. Il y a le bruit de l'ascenseur qui est présent quand il marche mais qui n'est finalement pas dérangeant (surtout le nuit où il n'est pas utilisé). Sinon c'est très calme."

The apartment is relatively small, but if you don’t plan spending too much time in, it’s ok.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the host did not prepare the apartment for the number of people on the booking, although we specifically stated it and checked everyone in at the request of the host. Linen and towels were missing and no toiletries were present at the bathrooms.<br/><br/>We arrived late at the apartment, and the host couldn’t supply the items until the next day."
30314696,593884864,2020-01-17,157628664,Alejandro Israel,"El lugar bastante lindo y tecnológico, respecto a la ingreso y al sistema interno del departamento. Algo que es importante, no recuerdo si ellos olvidaron o no decirme, pero para ingresar, puesto que tiene un sistema de ingreso inteligente por Bluetooth, el teléfono debe tener configurado el uso horario del edificio sino no te deja ingresar. Fue un detalle que pudimos solucionar minutos después. Respecto a todo lo demas, el departamento para 6 es cómodo solo para dormir, asumo vayan en una temporada cálida para hacer uso de la terraza, que por cierto tiene una vista hermosa hacía el Acrópolis. Obvio que el precio que pagamos para 6 fue mínimo y como nos tocaron días lindos, no nos fue incómodo desplazarnos, pero para alguien que quiera espacios mas grandes es un detalle importante.<br/>Sobre la atención, fueron rápidos y amables. Nos gustó mucho, la ubicación es perfecta y el sistema interno de ingreso al departamento por Bluetooth o tarjeta es cómodo para quienes quieren salir o ingresar en distintos tiempos. Recomendable 100%!"

30314696,667639063,2020-09-25,7105747,Simon,The apartment was a great place for exploring the nearby sights of Athens with a beautiful roof top terrace for nightly views on the Acropolis! An appropriately outfitted kitchen and well functioning aircons also make this a great retreat if the city or it's heat are overwhelming.<br/><br/>It's probably a better fit for 4 people since it's very packed with 6. I would recommend to provide more key cards.

Volgens mij is het niet de bedoeling dat een airbnb-verhuurder online allerlei kopie paspoorten verzamelt van huurders."

Olala is also flexible with check-in and check-out time, which was extremely helpful. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for a few night stay.<br/><br/>The neighborhood outside the apartment had a lot of life within walking distances. However, it was very quiet when you were in the loft. The apartment was walking distance to some tourist attractions, and it was close to many metros to get you to the ones further away. This is definitely the perfect place to stay in Athens."

It needed 4-5 attempts to get opened by the application they use. <br/>The internet connection could be better. Keep in mind that during the weekend there is some noice from the bars in the neighborhood.

30314701,421481451194676841,2021-08-04,214879350,Stergios,"The stay at the apartment was terrible.<br/>First and foremost, the employees violated Covid-19 rules, after the owner did not make sure that the cleaning crew follows protocols and wears protective gear. More specifically, the cleaner did not wear a mask or gloves while cleaning the apartment, he approached us beyond the safe distance without a mask, and touched all our objects without gloves, despite our disagreement. <br/>When we reached the apartment, we could not enter, despite being there 2 hours after the check-in time (i.e., 3 pm). After trying multiple times to communicate sufficiently with the quite rude personnel, we managed to get in about 3 hours after the check-in time. While trying to express the aforementioned issues, we were told that we should feel happy that we even entered our apartment. <br/>The representative even accused us of being responsible for not being able to enter, due to not providing our IDs. This, of course, was totally inaccurate, since all IDs were submitted the previous night and no notification was sent. Instead, they sent us an email exactly the time we contacted them for not being able to enter the apartment (around 6 pm local time).<br/>To make matters worse, when we tried to alter our reservation and leave earlier, we received no refund for the nights we did not stay there.<br/>The apartment condition is not reflecting the price, as the floor, the furniture, and the bathroom walls were full of stains.<br/>It is needless to say that it is almost impossible to communicate properly, while the customer service and care are completely substandard.<br/>Due to all the foregoing issues and the dangerous behavior of employees when it comes to public health issues, I would recommend anyone to think twice before booking with Olala Homes at Athens.<br/>I certainly will never ever attempt to book an apartment there."

Comfy bed and it’s quiet in the bedroom. <br/>The location is great, easy to walk to all the main places or transport. <br/>The downside was the communication. You dealing with a group that manages properties in many cities so you’re often responded to by someone else who hasn’t read what you’ve previously said. <br/>My three requests for a late check out were not responded to which was frustrating and meant I had a less than ideal experience in Athens.  If Olala can work on that or if you have no further needs or questions it would be great."

(Lipstick? blood? I really don't want to know)<br/>Which are pretty unacceptable for the price. <br/>Also the bathroom was a bit smelly, but I guess it's an Athens city center's problem,<br/> not the house's problem cause it comes from the drains."

30314706,613913867,2020-03-03,13320519,Bronagh,"This is a nice apartment if you have only 2 people staying there. We had 3 and it felt very claustrophobic at times. The bed is fine but the sofa bed is uncomfortable. However, if you're just there one or two nights, you'll be fine. The apartment itself is very ""high tech"" - there are no keys involved with getting into it or into the building, everything involves bluetooth. If technology isn't your friend, you may want to pass. I work in media and would like to consider myself pretty well versed in tech, but I had problems getting in at times. The location is perfect if you want to explore downtown Athens. You are just a few mins walk from Syntagma Square (where the airport bus will drop you) and you are within walking distance to, to name a few things, the Acropolis, Hadrian's wall, Zeus' Temple - all about 20 mins. You are surrounded by stores and restaurants too. Overall, would stay again if was travelling by myself or only with 1 other person."

And bus is the most convenient and cheapest way to get to and from the airport. <br/>- The Apartment is accessed by a mobile app key, which was super convenient. <br/>- The apartment had everything I needed for my short stay and even a fridge with some water and juice. <br/>- Ac and a balcony so you can have fresh air when you want. <br/>- It is a small apartment, which was great for me - I hate running around looking for my things when I’m checking out."

30314707,613499425,2020-03-02,151229034,Maria,Ενώ έδειχνε καθαρό δεν ήταν και τόσο το έβλεπες στα σημεία που θεώρησαν ότι δεν θα κοιτάξεις....Όπως και στις πετσέτες που είχαν τρίχες ενώ βέβαια ήταν πλυμενες....απλά οι μικρές λεπτομερείες θα έκαναν τη διαφορά<br/><br/><br/>.
30314707,644101804,2020-07-30,357963831,Guido,We stayed at olala homes for a few days and it was amazing. Also the location is very nice. It’s not noisy or anything because its in a smaller street and its a 5 minute walk from syntagma square (the heart of athens).
30314707,646829916,2020-08-05,98671160,Floriane,Super appartement très bien situé dans Athènes et très propre. <br/>La terrasse pour prendre le petit-déjeuner est très agréable !

30314707,658964624,2020-08-31,169380970,Ádám,"Nice, but don’t stay there too long"

30314707,432387521065233156,2021-08-19,54072590,Léa,"Un très bon séjour dans logement. Petit mais fonctionnel, nous avons passé 3 jours a Athènes bien situés non loin des quartiers touristiques mais au calme. Par contre peu adaptés pour de plus longs séjours. Les + : la communication avec l'agence, rapide et très claire, et un super suivi ; l'accès dans le logement électronique très pratique ; le mobilier contemporain et pratique, un logement propre, bien agencé, agréable. Les - : peu d'equipement cuisine et menager, pas de machine à laver comme indiqué sur l'annonce, j'ai du faire les lessives à la main au lavabo... Passé ces précisions, nous avons passé un très bon séjour dans ce logement et retourneront dans des résidences Olala avec plaisir."
30314708,401315853,2019-01-14,167885394,Ioannis,Το διαμέρισμα ήταν πεντακάθαρο. Πολύ καλή επιλογή για το κέντρο της Αθήνας.

30314708,423168785,2019-03-13,114485709,Roberta,L'alloggio è in una zona centrale vicino ai mezzi di trasporto e all'Acropoli. La stanza accogliente e super accessoriata con persino un piccolo cucinino .Non avere una persona in loco a volte può ritardare le procedure di check in e check out e ritiro bagagli.
30314708,577151629,2019-12-15,216017081,Αθανάσιος,"Ασφάλεια , καθαριότητα, εξυπηρέτηση , καλές παροχές ακριβώς στο κέντρο της Αθήνας"

30314708,450409391612910297,2021-09-13,27851331,Pak,"Good but small and impersonal. If you have special needs, like arriving early or having soap for the washing machine, you have to take care yourself."
30316740,400841583,2019-01-13,85082035,Areti,"Όλα πολύ καλά! Ευρύχωρο φωτεινό διαμέρισμα με μοντέρνα αισθητική.καθαρο, άνετος ύπνος και αρκετά κοντά στο μουσείο της Ακρόπολης και μετρό.η επικοινωνία άριστη. Γενικά το προτείνω άνετα και σίγουρα θα ξαναμεινουμε σε επόμενη επίσκεψη."
30316740,403095915,2019-01-20,12183257,Rory,"A great, super central, easy-to-access, stylish, minimal apartment with all the amenities that you may need within 2 - 5 minutes walking. If you were visiting Athens to do the main sights eg. Acropolis Museum, Plaka, etc. then this place is bang on the money. <br/><br/>Lots of natural light and very airy with supremely comfortable sofas in the lounge area perfect for overdosing on the Netflix which is provided and a wonderfully large, super comfortable bed in the master bedroom. The kitchen was a little under equipped, but I have fed back to Athansios, the very helpful owner who met me personally on arrival.<br/><br/>Some fairly heavy traffic noise in the early hours of the (Sunday) morning between 00:00 - 04:00am, even though the property is double glazed, but then the location is very central and directly opposite what seems to be one of the main artery roads.<br/><br/>Pre / post booking communication was excellent and prompt. <br/><br/>Highly recommend this Airbnb for anyone looking for central, spacious, accommodation."
30316740,416164536,2019-02-24,242769752,Reynol,Anthanasio really goes above and beyond to make sure all of your needs are met. He made sure I had everything I needed and he answered my questions in a timely manner. The location is ideal for anyone trying to see all of Athens attractions most of them are walking distance.

Flat is in a central location close to all site seeing but flat itself was nice and quiet. Athanasios gave us tips on where to go and where we can have nice real Greek food which was amazing.  I would definitely recommend his flat to my friends and go back at some point too."

Sparkling clean, delightful decoration and cozy space with all the furniture in perfect condition. The communication was perfect, Athanasios answered right away to all my questions and offered transportation to pick up and drop off to the airport for am extra cost, however was really comfortable as we didn't worried about logistics. <br/><br/>The beds are really comfortable and smell fresh ! The water pressure in the bathroom is really good and as I mentioned before all clean. <br/><br/>The greatest perk of this place is the location, just few minutes to Acropolis museum, Zeus temple and 10 min walk to acropolis, there are some restaurants around as supermarkets. <br/><br/>This is my first time in Greece and Athanasios was a smart decision ! <br/><br/>Gracias !"

We stayed at another apartment upon arrival and liked it much better because the host welcomed us warmly and made us feel at home.

30316740,485039885,2019-07-10,5515601,Valerie,"We arrived very very early in Athens after taking the red eye in from Barcelona. ( Bad idea) We were exhausted and Athens was 90 degrees, with hours to wait before check in, I was worried our first day would be bad, but our host  Athanasios did everything possible to bring our check-in time forward. Even allowing us to leave our luggage with him while we had breakfast and waited. He also arranged for a cab to pick us up from the airport, and take us to the port 2 days later. Everything in the apartment was immaculate, with even a few breakfast supplies in the fridge. We were not expecting such care and attention. <br/>Close to everything this is ideal if you’re here for a short stay. Can’t recommend enough. <br/>The only thing to note is it is quite a noisy intersection, we sat outside on the balcony in the evening but street traffic was loud. Inside the apartment through is very quiet. A bonus for vegans there’s a great restaurant just downstairs, next door. The  food looked very good and fresh.<br/>Yes stay at Athanasios’s you will love it there."

Everything was in walking distance. Athanasios was easy to communicate and very prompt. The only con was that the bathroom smelled slightly unpleasant but we believe this is due to the plumbing system in the building. Thank you Athanasios for welcoming us Athens!
30316740,518705917,2019-08-27,274294347,Ann,The apartment was very comfortable for our 2-night stay in Athens. We were able to park our car on the street in front of the apartment for our stay and were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.
30316740,520247697,2019-08-30,203026,Christopher,"Athanasios’s apartment was perfect for our trip to Athens! Athanasios was very helpful in arranging our taxi's for every portion of our trip to and from the airport, and to the ferry at the port. The apartment was central to all of the tourist areas, which made walking everywhere without taking the metro easy. The rooms were spacious, clean, and included extra amenities such as orange juice, eggs, and yogurt in the refrigerator! We would definitely come back!"

It was clean and comfortable, which was much appreciated after a long day of travel from the States.  The location couldn't have been much better. It's within walking distance of all the major sights, great restaurants and bars and shopping. Getting there was also very easy off the metro from the airport, saving us on paying for a taxi. Athanasios was a fantastic host, giving us tips and showing us maps of the city and how to navigate. He was also very patient with us as our flight was over 2 hours delayed. Overall, for the price, this place is a great value. Highly recommend!"

L’appartamento  Si trova al primo piano rialzato, per cui qualche rumore dalla strada è normale. In generale è tranquillo. Dalle foto è poco chiaro che la camera matrimoniale non ha affaccio sull’esterno ma  ha una finestra che guarda sulla zona giorno ed una grande porta a vetri scorrevole, per cui non manca luce ne’ aria! <br/>È un piacere trovare nel frigo acqua fresca e frutta! Ottimo rapporto qualità/ prezzo. Consigliato!!"

Germaine was very easy to communicate with, check-in was easy and she also allowed us to check-out later as she had no new guests coming in that day. There is a little booklet made up with places to eat etc, which was a lovely touch. Would definitely recommend. If you have a car, however, parking can be difficult so I wouldn't suggest this place for you!"

Мы остались очень довольны квартирой,районом и общением с хозяином.Квартира ""дышит ""теплом и семейным уютом.Всегда доступна горячая вода.Единственной проблемой было то, что прогреть квартиру можно только с помощью кондиционера,а этого не совсем было достаточно.(учитывая что я была с маленьким ребенком).Район спокойный и удобный.Рядом с домом много уютных кафе и есть место прогуляться.До центра мы добирались на троллейбусе несколько остановок.С радостью вернёмся в эту красивую квартиру!"

30335955,494953913,2019-07-25,14411784,Kirill,"Это одна из самых лучших квартир, в которых мы останавливались через airbnb, и Тео прекрасный хозяин. Он моментально отвечал на наши сообщения, заселил нас гораздо раньше, чем обозначенное в объявлении время, и был очень приветливым. Квартира гораздо лучше, чем на фото! Это настоящее жильё греческой семьи, невероятно уютное и продуманное до мелочей, с высокими потолками, мебелью из натурального дерева и большими зеркалами. В гостиной, спальне и детской/кабинете - по кондиционеру. Все окна можно закрывать автоматически задвигающимися ставнями. Огромное удовольствие отдыхать на балконе. Он под навесом и жара не чувствуется. В квартире есть всё всё всё, что вы только можете себе представить, от посудомоечной машины до мини-миксера для взбивания молока в капучино. Расположение дома отличное. От него начинается бульвар с множеством прекрасных кафе, рядом продают вкуснейший гирос  за 2,5-3 евро, но особенно советую кондитерскую Max Perry чуть дальше по улице, невероятно вкусные десерты! Если вы на машине: в квартале всегда можно найти бесплатное парковочное место, а также есть платный паркинг 10 евро в сутки, но район безопасный, особой нужды в нем нет. В общем, в это жильё действительно хочется возвращаться, и если я буду в Греции, то обязательно остановлюсь здесь же!"

At the same time, there are a lot of coffeshops, bakeries, and restaurants just next to the house, that's why having a dinner or a glass of wine in a nice place on a terrace won't be a problem as well. <br/>The location is very good: it's not touristy, at the same time it doesn't take too long to go to the center: 40 min walking or around 20 min by metro. <br/>Tèo was very helpful and ready to answer our questions anytime. <br/>Thank you Tèo for your help and your lovely flat!"

30342328,531795432,2019-09-18,293724919,Karolis,"Worth for the price. As Tasos mentioned in description there is no balcony and location is loud, especially if you open windows and blinds for daylight. But it’s not a problem to be with closed windows because air conditioner works fine and freshens the air. Bed very very comfy and linen was perfect. Kitchen has everything you would ever need. Metro and cozy shops, Lidl is very near."

The biggest advantage is the location (the apartment is 300 meters from metro station). Close to the apartment you can find everything (restaurants, super markets, grocery store, butcher shop, coffee shops etc.) Small disadvantage is street noise but I got used to it very quickly. I recommend this apartment."

30362207,715701930,2020-12-15,30593454,Eric,"Perfect place for travelers. Location is amazing. Close to public transit, supermarket, pharmacy and of course all of the tourist attractions. We loved the tiny little studio. It is small but is Soo well thought out and has everything. It is a perfect place for a couple. Also the gym in the basement is amazing. Hard to find one of such high quality at any hotels we have stayed at. Highly recommend a stay with Mary."

30362207,762726763,2021-05-26,36508515,Jae,"This small apartment is great for 1-2 people, it’s located in a quiet, peaceful residential street but is also near the Acropolis and all the central attractions. <br/><br/>It has a small but well equipped kitchen for cooking, great AC, a swiveling smart TV that you can watch from the sofa or bed, and a surprisingly large balcony that runs the length of the apartment. The balcony does get full sun during the day though and doesn’t have an umbrella or cover, so I recommend sitting out in the evening. <br/><br/>The building also has an elevator which makes getting to your room easy."
30362207,392428811825061908,2021-06-25,132297544,Osuola,This place was a steal for the price. Very clean and comfortable. Pretty close to the metro stations as well.

Ο χώρος είναι εξοπλισμένος με ό,τι μπορεί να χρειαστεί κανείς και καθαρός. Το μπαλκόνι είναι ένα ωραίο έξτρα στοιχείο. Η τοποθεσία είναι πολύ καλή. Το σύστημα των κωδικών για τις πόρτες πολύ βολικό. Για εμάς συγκεκριμένα που φτάσαμε σε περίεργη ώρα, ήταν τέλεια λύση :)"

30364212,493836782,2019-07-23,204726688,Callie,Stayed for one evening at the Elikon with two friends. We had an enjoyable experience and loved how close the hotel was to the local metro as well as the Acropolis.

Beds are super comfortable. It’s been the best place we have stayed in during our time in Greece. Would 100% recommend this place to anyone staying in Athens.

When we walked in, we were immediately impressed by the design and decor. The apartment was beautifully styled as you see in the pictures, clean, very comfortable and well equipped.<br/><br/>Esmeralda, the host, was super friendly and exceptional in communicating with us. The check-in autonomous and really easy.<br/><br/>We stayed with two other colleagues and it was just perfect, as each bedroom as its own bathroom (even even an extra one). This is really a huge positive point.<br/><br/>Would highly recommend! :)"

Super clean, everything brand new, and very safe. The downstairs free laundry, play room, gym, and available printing station was a plus plus. Quiet neighborhood. Only 20 minute walk from the Acropolis and plenty of nearby restaurants and markets. We would definitely stay there again."

They really have thought of all the small touches to make you feel at home and give you everything you need for your stay.<br/>Thank you guys for a great stay, it was only short but we intend to return!"

30364342,559512428,2019-11-04,60471463,John,This is one of the best Airbnb’s! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and will stay again next time I’m in Athens.
30364342,568962742,2019-11-25,17977020,Krishant,Great place with easy access to the main sights in Athens. The place its self is beautifully decorated and well furnished. It also had a great wifi connection to boot.

Right in the middle of the city and lots of local places around. Many grocery stores within a few minutes walk. The main squares and Acropolis are 10 min walk away. We walked everywhere, everything was close by. Would highly recommend!"

30364342,591930957,2020-01-12,36338499,Elizabeth,"This is a fabulous place to stay! It is beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, and has all you need for a really comfortable and relaxing stay. It’s in a great spot, too - a quiet neighbourhood with friendly and welcoming shops and bars nearby, and only a 15 minute very pleasant stroll to the central attractions. The flat is really spacious and a very welcoming retreat after a day of enjoying all that Athens has to offer. We loved the gym downstairs too which is well equipped and helped us shed some of the extra calories from our discoveries of vegan eateries in the city, of which there are many and good! The flat was also really well set up for cooking meals in. Can’t recommend this flat highly enough, I would definitely hope to return in the future."
30364342,593843851,2020-01-17,71419267,Anthony,This place is amazing. I would highly recommend this airbnb to whomever is traveling to Athens. Mary's place is the central location to all of the attractions and restaurants. They are very quick on responding when you have questions and very accommodating when traveling doesn't quite go the way you plan it to go.
30364342,604058996,2020-02-10,1494220,Greg,"This is the best place I have stayed I Athens so far. The location is quite central- metro only 10 minutes away. Everything was perfectly clean, comfortable beds and very nicely furnished. Set check in is very easy with code pads and no keys which made it very convenient for people arriving at different times. We had a small issue with hot water which was resolved quickly and professionally- communication was great. Highly recommend staying here."

30364342,608241523,2020-02-20,38392462,John,This place was a great location (about a 20 min walk to the acropolis) for experiencing the city. Six of us stayed here comfortably for a half a week each with our own space and bathroom. Esmeralda was quick to communicate and arranged travel from the airport directly to the apartment which took all the stress of trying to initially navigate a new country. I would recommend this area for couples and young people traveling because you are walking distance to bars and restaurants

The apartment was super clean, the beds were very comfortable, every bedroom had it's own bathroom which is really a big big advantage. Kitchen is very well furnished and the communication with the host was very easy. In the neighborhood, there is a bakery, a butcher and a supermarket where you can find all you need for a pleasant stay. It's a little walk to go to the city center (+/- 15'-20'), but Uber or the taxis of Athens are everywhere. You just have to know that they take max 3 persons in their car. I can only recommend this place, we would definitely go back again."

30364342,472895565508029161,2021-10-14,39751878,Belle,"This Airbnb is modern, comfortable, tastefully furnished, well equipped and spotless. We felt like we were in a hotel and loved our stay here. There were washing machines in the building as well as a communal gym which were nice for a long stay. The apartment is located slightly out of the city but a short taxi ride away or walk (15-25 mins). We loved Cedro Negro, a restaurant walking distance from the Airbnb and highly recommend it. Overall a wonderful stay and we would return again!"
30365071,429822557,2019-03-29,42808763,Charles,"I travel full-time, so I literally live solely in airbnbs and tourist apartments. So trust me on this: Hercules Residence is one of the best places you’ll ever stay in. <br/><br/>This is what perfection looks like:<br/><br/>1) The best gym I’ve seen in an airbnb, with brand-new equipment, two TVs, plenty of space, yoga mats, and… wait for it… inspirational quotes from Socrates! Awesome.<br/><br/>2) The best playroom I’ve ever seen ANYWHERE I’ve stayed. Every morning, my 1-year-old daughter would point to the door, asking to go downstairs to play. <br/><br/>3) A lot of airbnbs get 5 stars for cleanliness, but that often just means that a place is “clean enough.” Hercules Residence is CLEAN. Like, really clean. <br/><br/>4) The best-equipped kitchen I’ve ever seen in this type of rental, with all sorts of thoughtful touches: Greek olive oil for cooking(!), THREE coffee options (American-style drip coffee, Nespresso-style pods, or instant Nescafe), plenty of pots and pans. Knives that actually cut. A dishwasher with detergent provided. Everything you could possibly need -- and that's really rare in an airbnb.<br/><br/>5) Awesome, fun, thoughtful, decor. Each room is unique, featuring another of the labors of Hercules. So much fun, especially if you have kids.<br/><br/>6) Wonderful staff that’s ready to help with whatever you need. All sorts of great local tips and advice.<br/><br/>7) A really great location, in a fairly quiet neighborhood, but an easy walk to restaurants and cafes and bakeries. Gazi – Athen’s premier artsy hipster neighborhood – is around the corner, and the Acropolis is a short cab ride or a healthy walk. Thissio Bakery, a few blocks away, is incredible. <br/><br/>I’ll stop now. Seriously, just stay here. If this exact apartment isn’t available, these same awesome hosts have several more in the same building. Just leave one apartment for us, because we’ll be back."
30365071,442263659,2019-04-23,13213532,Historical Canal House,"Fantastic apartment, close to  everything you want to experience in Athens. I would stay here again."
30365071,453254758,2019-05-15,45278898,Gino,"I rarely give 5/5s but it was earned here. <br/><br/>It's very easy to get to the flat, especially if you allow the hosts to arrange an airport transfer for you. It's maybe 5-8 Euros more than a cab would be, but the driver (Spiros in my case) was friendly and offered some helpful tips about things to do and see.<br/><br/>Getting into the building and flat is very straight forward. Both the building and apartment doors use keypads, the codes for which we provided in advance of my trip. Note, however, that the door to the flat occasionally seems completely closed (and latched) when it's not. Guests are advised to give the door a little push or pull to be sure that it is latched. <br/><br/>The flat is new - it seems that the building was recently renovated. The furniture is simple but nice. The beds are comfortable. There's a gym in the basement and free laundry facilities. The building is fairly quiet.<br/><br/>The supplies were minimal (soap, toilet paper, etc). Guests can stock-up on some simple items at a small store that is  ~2 minute walk away.<br/><br/>There are a number of nice restaurants within a 10 minute walk. <br/><br/>I was a little surprised by the sign in the washrooms advising guests not to put paper in the toilet. It turns out that they actually mean don't put toilet paper into the toilet! It seems that the sewage plumbing in Greece uses piping that only 2 inches in diameter, whereas its at least twice as large in most other urban areas. This was weird for me, but when in Greece... <br/><br/>The apartment is very well located for those who are interested in visiting some of the historic sites in Athens. The Acropolis is only a 20 minute walk away, and many key sites are even closer.  The older part of Athens, Plaka, is quite nice. People who have mobility issues should be aware that it's an uphill walk to the tourist parts of the city.<br/><br/>I didn't spot recycling bins in the apartment. <br/><br/>Over all, I enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back."
30365071,477453760,2019-06-28,57229653,Tina,"Our six day stay was exemplary. We enjoyed the seamless check in and the room itself was all we needed. We especially enjoyed the location which was close to transportation, great local eateries and cultural sites. We were also pleased with the laundry facilities and one of the best gyms I've seen at any accommodation.  We will be back again."

Our communication with the host was very prompt and clear, and the check-in process couldn’t have been easier.

It’s been the best place we’ve stayed at in Athens and we would definitely come back in the future!"

Le quartier bien que résidentiel regorge de petites perles comme le bar restaurant Picothiseio qui attire par sa jolie couleur bleue. georgios vous accueillera avec plaisir et vous fera goûter d'excellents cocktails accompagné de très bonnes choses (saumon mariné,  salade grecque améliorée). Sinon l'appartement se situe à 15 minutes à pied du centre d'Athènes et a 10 minutes du métro. L'atmosphère du quartier facilite l'authenticité des échanges avec les grecs.

Located in city center area, but in a very quiet place. 15 min walk to the Acropolis and the old city center. I really like the concept of the doors with code, you don't need any keys to carry. There's a gym n the -1 floor, laundry room, kids entertainment room and the lockers, so you can leave the language after the check out and keep exploring the city."

The WiFi worked great and everything was comfortable, allowing me to work in peace. The property is spacious, modern, clean, and nothing was left to be desired for more. The attendant, Esmeralda, was also very knowledgeable and communicative by (Hidden by Airbnb) .<br/><br/>The gym is actually well-equipped and better than most hotel gyms so it is perfect for fitness enthusiasts like me who like to get at least some workout in when on the road!"

Het balkon heeft ochtend zon waardoor je er heerlijk kan ontbijten. Het is een rustige en veilige buurt.  Alles is op loopafstand. <br/>Zal het zeker iedereen aanraden. Wij hebben een geweldige week gehad. En de prijs van het appartement is zeker niet te veel.

The apartment is really well equipped (more things here than in any other place I have rented so far) and it is the perfect size for two.<br/><br/>Location surprised as much better than expected. The building is on a side street, so there are almost no cars driving outside, it is in a quiet and peaceful area. There was no problem getting around visiting the city. However, I would recommend taking a taxi if you have a lot of luggage when arriving and leaving (not expensive between 5 AM and midnight + fixed rates). <br/><br/>Hosts are really nice and helpful, they will do what they can to make your stay the best. Communication is available through different platforms with quick and detailed responses.<br/><br/>We would stay again!"

Άμεση επίσης πρόσβαση σε super Market, φαρμακείο κλπ.

Helpful and friendly, especially when you start waving at them. The place is super professional and clean, feels like a boutique Hotel. <br/>Amazing location with a very short walk before you hit the promenade surrounding the Ancient sites. No need for a car - its a wonderful modern and clean place in the middle of authentic Athens and 2 blocks off the beaten path. So calm and real - yet so close to the attractions. You can not beat the price of this gem and Mary, Esmeralda and their team are available in an instant and have great communication skills."

The whole building is in excellent condition and I enjoyed the Hercules and bull story attached to the studio. The decore is very modern. For example, there is a  huge platform bed that is extremely comfortable and low to the ground that you enter from the bottom, not the sides. The TV spins so you can watch from the couch or the bed. I will definitely stay there again on trips to Athens."

This word also describes the incredible communication and hospitality from Vasilis, our contact for the stay. From the moment we booked, he was in touch with helpful details and information, as well as quick answers to any questions and superb recommendations. <br/><br/>The apartment itself is perhaps even more delightful than in the photos. The giant living/dining area features marble floors, plus two large sofas and even a ""fainting couch""! The TV is great, too. Designer touches are all around, including the coolest little paper sculptures encased in glass/plexigalss. The dining table is sizeable enough for several guests to enjoy. The two bedrooms seem to be of equal size and each feature a comfortable, large bed with an assortment of pillows. There also is plenty of storage space for all your clothing, etc. <br/><br/>The main bath features a rain shower and has both plenty of pressure and loads of hot water. The half bath is perfectly functional. In the kitchen, you'll find all appliances listed, as well as plenty of dishware, glassware, cookware, etc. There also are more kitchen essentials than the norm, including coffee, tea, and spices.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Athens.

Ma famille et moi avons séjourné 3 nuits dans l’appartement de Spiros, et nous avons beaucoup apprécié l’espace très spacieux, très bien décoré, l’immense terrasse et le confort de la literie. La climatisation est aussi très appréciable, il faisait très chaud et cela nous a permis de faire des « pauses fraîcheurs » dans la journée entre deux ballades.

Propriétaire très réactif et très soucieux du bien-être des hôtes, Spiros a très bien organisé la remise des clés à notre arrivée. <br/>L'appartement est très bien décoré, en particulier dans sa pièce principale, très agréable pour se poser entre deux ballades dans la ville. La climatisation dans cette pièce et dans les chambres est également appréciable !<br/>L'appartement bénéficie d'une très grande terrasse, malheureusement exposée au soleil une grande partie de la journée et sans auvent pour protéger un peu de la chaleur. Il est toutefois possible d'y rester le matin et de bénéficier le soir d'une très belle vue sur Athènes. <br/>La situation de l'appartement est bonne : tout peut se faire à pied ou en taxi très facilement. Pour aller à Ermou et Monastiraki, il faut compter une vingtaine de minutes. À proximité, on trouve des petites supérettes pour le ravitaillement ainsi que Bread Factory (pains, pâtisseries, pizzas, traiteur), très pratique pour organiser facilement le repas du soir."

This was definitely one of the most beautiful apartments I’ve stayed in! While I didn’t get a chance to meet the hosts, they were above and beyond helpful and responsive. If you’re looking for a place in Athens and this apartment is available - don’t think twice!"

30366581,406901910374304195,2021-07-15,334058038,Dilay,"The apartment itself was really nice. The kitchen especially very well-equipped like home. The rest was also as nice as in pictures. However, we really didn’t like the neighbourhood at all. It is closeby to central areas and location is really good in that sense but walking to those areas was not nice (both day or night). Metro and bus stops are really closeby so using public transport to go to central areas and not being alone might solve this problem."

There's a bakery close by and some mini markets. The view from the huge balcony is so nice for watching the sunset and the style of the apartment is really unique and fun. The pictures actually give a great representation. The flat is super huge and really ideal for larger groups of people (which we were 4 and it was perfect). Spiros was very helpful and told us anything we needed and helped with arranging transport. We wish we would have met him in person, but communication was very fast and easy, as well as check in and check out. It was a great place to stay."

Then had a detailed list of all the things we would possibly need to know. He also had little gifts on the bed for us which was so thoughtful! Oh and a little breakfast toast with jam and juice for us in the morning. His home is sparking clean and so nice!! The location is really hard to top too. We were so close to the Parathion and 20 or so minutes from the city square. I loved staying here and would recommend this to anyone!

The apartment is very well done and equipped with all the basic amenities that one would require for a comfortable stay.

He welcomed us with small gifts and also provided some snacks.he also gave us an insight about the area and places to visit.Since we had a baby he also managed to arrange a cot which was a bonus. everything was walkable from the apartment.  The cafes nearby were also great for breakfast and dinner with very reasonable pricing.<br/>Even a late checkin and an early checkout was no problem with him. <br/>We highly recommend this place<br/>Thanks.

30373137,415604528,2019-02-23,2478878,Thomas,Mag's place is a good place to stay while in Athens. It is small but fully private and very comfortable. I arrived in a well heated room (highly appreciated as it was a bit cold outside) and felt welcome from the beginning. The pictures describe this place very well but it actually felt more comfortable than the pictures suggested. The check-in was very easy and so was the check-out. <br/>The only slightly negative points are basically outside of Mag's control and would be the limited amount of hot water for a shower and the ongoing construction at the ground level. <br/>Overall I can just recommend this place and will book it again.
30373137,421798396,2019-03-10,247456469,Atina,İt was at the center. I mean ıt was 5 minutes from the Monastiraki square. The location was Good. The Room is little bit Small but you dont stay at the room so Much. I asked for a kettle and they bought for us. He answered very fast.Thanks Mag.

Arrendatario responde todos los (Hidden by Airbnb) ."
30373137,435401648,2019-04-10,38377726,Melina,"Mag's studio is centrally located; only a 10-minute walk from Monastiraki square. The communication with Mag (via Airbnb) went smoothly. Guests should be aware of the structure of the bathroom, which isn't so comfortable but for some people it might work. Netflix is a nice touch and we really appreciated the balcony. The only negative point to mention is that the room was not super clean, there was a lot of dust. A basic studio, which is perfect for a short trip to Athens."
30373137,437750476,2019-04-15,189880333,Pontille,Très bien situé et très propre

Great location and furthermore I’d like to highlight that the area is not dangerous at  all as I saw on some comments people felt insecure. Most apartments in the building are let by Airbnb and you could meet nice travellers. Small and cozy apartment. I’d recommend for couples."

L'appartement bien situé, pas loin à pied   de tous les sites à visiter. Au niveau propreté très bien, par contre la salle de bain vraiment exiguë,  les petits gabarits comme nous ça va pour 3 jours. La vue du balcon vraiment pas terrible sur des immeubles délabrés. Mais nous sommes là pour visiter Athènes donc c'est pas non plus primordial.  Nous n'avons pas rencontré notre hôte mais il est très réactif aux messages. Dans l'ensemble c'est un bon rapport qualité prix."

The Arpartment is in a big buliding but it was very quiet. I think for the really small bathroom it is good to stay as a couple or by yourself.<br/>We had a great time and would come back."

Location is great because very close to everything (best bars and café’s, cool areas, metro, “Sklavenitis” supermarket just in 10min waking distance ).

Рядом с домом есть автобусная остановка, с которой можно доехать до Пирей на автобусе 049. До ближайшего супермаркета идти минут 10. В холле на первом этаже стоит автомат, где можно купить напитки.

Enough to spend a couple of days for 1 or 2 persons.<br/><br/>However, the air conditioning does not work properly. I would say even that it works mostly like a fan with a very limited cooling capacity. On hot days in Athens it was not too much pleasant."

While the area between the appartment and Acropolis is safe, the area past the appartment doesn’t seem the safest, especially for women, as I recieved a lot of uncomfortable looks and I witnessed some unpleasant situation. So I wouldn't recommend to have night walks at that direction. <br/>The appartment itself was really clean and cozy and ac helped to survive the heat. Kitchen and bathroom are pretty small but have everything for surviving.<br/>We got upset tha the Wi-Fi didn’t work well on some days (stayed for 10 days). But the host was sincerely trying to help and I think if we contacted him sooner about that, the problem would be sold quickly. Also the host answered all our questions and was open to our requests, which I really appreciated!"

30385286,525143253,2019-09-07,271546515,Alex,"A nice, updated, and clean apartment. Even though small, there is plenty of cabinets to store all you can bring. There is a very small balcony, enough for you to bring a couple of chairs (from the kitchen) and have a cup of coffee in the morning (the sun only hits it in the afternoon). We did not hear any noise from the apt upstairs.<br/>The mattress and pillows need improvement, and a blackout curtain would be a plus.<br/>The location is OK. It's a bit run-down, and there is not much around, but by the Metro station (less than 10 min away) there are a few food stores; Venetis has delicious Greek pastries.  The metro is 5 stops from Sintagma, the real center of Athens. <br/>Stavros is helpful with your questions and requests, and will give you total privacy.<br/>I would stay there again."

The apartment is small but done with lots of charm.  Pretty good WIFI ( my experience is that Greece doesn’t have the strongest service). Very well equipped kitchen with a great washer, boiler, coffee, detergent and plenty of cookware and dishes.  Bathroom is modern, clean and plenty of hot water.  Comfortable bed and lots of electrical outlets.  You will hear a train pass by on occasion but that ads a bit of urban charm.  Good security and an elevator.  Balcony with clothes line.  Communication with Stavros is outstanding and rapid. No question that we will stay here again if we find ourselves in Athens. Highly recommended!"

He is an amazing host!<br/>The location of the apartment is ideal, it is easily accessible and close to the metro station.

30387738,417421692,2019-02-27,12451644,Greta,"The apartment is in a perfect location to explore the city. The balcony is amazing, with a great view. The apartment is in a typical “city-size” - you have air condition when it’s cold outside, but i think it’s more fun to be there in the summer. You don’t get the kitchen really warm. The bathroom is really small, but it was clean. The rest of the apartment was a bit dusty and not perfectly clean. Nevertheless the price was very good and in the summer, you can really enjoy the view! The communication was really fast and good."
30387738,420595450,2019-03-07,98942653,Maru,Muy lindo el departamento. Con vista de la acropolis. Cerca de Psiri. Ideal para ir a comer y visitar la acropolis. Muy buenas recomendaciones de los anfitriones. Excelente para parejas jovenes. Volveriamos!
30387738,421762750,2019-03-10,154985037,Christie,"With a clean, well-kept space and a spacious balcony, this accommodation was perfect for a short trip to Athens. The location is great, and the view of the Acropolis made the sunny balcony a great hang-out spot. I would highly recommend this place!"
30387738,425384791,2019-03-18,130009004,Donatella,"Konstantina's space is just as pictured. A beautiful little studio with a very nice view. It's at the best possible location so you don't really need to use transportation, everything is between 10-30 minutes away by foot (Monastiraki sq, the Acropolis, nightlife, shops and pharmacies etc). Value for money and definitely recommended."
30387738,434989012,2019-04-09,251260067,Beata,"All sights are within walking distance, nice view of Acropolis"

30387738,439991443,2019-04-20,122010802,Phanny,Appartement très bien situé. Proche du métro (2 stations). On peut faire l'ensemble des visites à pieds. Il est propre et à une vue magnifique sur l'accropole depuis le balcon.
30387738,443953138,2019-04-27,35481980,Johnny,"I greatly enjoyed my stay at Konstantina and Niko’s penthouse! <br/><br/>The space was very clean and the bed superbly comfortable. <br/><br/>The balcony is expansive and the view of the Parthenon is stunning! I did yoga on the balcony every morning with the Parthenon in the background- such a memorable experience. <br/><br/>The location is phenomenal. A step away from the craziness of the city center, but a close walk to restaurants and cafes. Only a pleasant, scenic 15 minute walk to the Acropolis and surrounding attractions.<br/><br/>For what this space offers, it is a superb value!<br/><br/>Thank you Konstantina & Nikos!"
30387738,446272956,2019-05-01,210586064,Jacinthe,"Beau petit studio près  de l’acropole. Parfait pour personne seule ou en couple. La terrasse est un atout majeur.  Notez qu’il est possible que d’autres personnes fassent un party sur la leur. Il faut donc savoir que l’intimité n’est pas très présente. Malgré cela, je recommande cet appartement."
30387738,447735522,2019-05-04,21695178,Anne Sophie,"Studio conforme aux photographies, à 5mn de Thissio.  Nikos est très sympathique et arrangeant. Très bon rapport qualité prix."

They were very responsive, welcoming, and overall great hosts. The apartment is charming, well-placed, and in a quiet neighborhood. Highly recommend."

30387738,459235701,2019-05-27,105605132,Panayiotis,"The place was awesome wrt the view to Acropolis and the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. The bathroom is kind of small, but if you're on vacations, this goes unnoticed. It can serve as an ideal base point for sight-seeing at Parthenon, Acropolis, Plaka, Thissio, and other downtown hot-spots. There is a very convenient coffee place right around the corner and a grocery store two blocks on the back of the building. I literally have no negative comments for this place as a short time tourist in my own city. I would definitely suggest it..."
30387738,463851842,2019-06-04,130021456,Rhiannon,When you are visiting you have an expansive balcony with chairs and a table to enjoy the view of the acropolis. As a bonus there is an elevator in the building if you don’t want to use the stairs or if you have mobility issues. The host and co-host were great. Nikos was very accommodating with our check in times and gave us great advice and tour locations to check out and what to avoid.
30387738,465669140,2019-06-08,19200335,Costel,"Great communication, location, balcony! It was great "
30387738,467410687,2019-06-10,5980475,Annette,"Die Lage der Unterkunft ist super - das Zentrum ist bequem zu Fuß zu erreichen. <br/>Wir hatten Probleme, das Haus von der Metro-Station aus zu finden - trotz (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps und Stadtplan. Tipp: Lasst Euch eine Wegbeschreibung geben.<br/>Der Blick vom Balkon auf die Akropolis ist toll. Leider konnten wir auf dem Balkon nicht frühstücken, da kein Sonnenschutz vorhanden ist.<br/>Das ""Penthouse"" ist relativ klein und eng, ganz besonders das Bad. Für 2 bis 3 Nächte  bestens geeignet, für einen längeren Aufenthalt würde ich es nicht empfehlen."
30387738,468302585,2019-06-12,15822773,Ruben,"This small apartment situated on the 5th floor (small elevator present) is a perfect base to explore the city from. Its main amenity is the terrace, which, importantly, lies in the shadow from the late afternoon/early evening onward. The neighbourhood containts various shops and bars. A list with suggestions on where to go for eating/drinking/shopping lies waiting in the apartment. All communication was very smooth and quick.<br/><br/>Recommended."

30387738,478859665,2019-06-30,20724222,Waei Ning,"This place is amazing. It is close to the Acropolis (walkable in 15-20mins) with a lot of nice eateries. There is a supermarket less than 5mins away, and the metro for line 3 (direct to the airport) is just a 7min walk away.<br/><br/>The unit itself is small and cozy, which is just nice for 2 people. Very nice balcony with a fantastic view of the Acropolis at night. The bathroom was a little small but it was alright for us. The shower has good water pressure and hot water.<br/><br/>The host Nikos was very responsive, responsible and accommodating. We had a bit of trouble with the door and he didn't hesitate to show up and help us sort out the problem. There is also a ""survival guide"" that he prepared. Very handy for first timers getting around Athens"

30387738,502797194,2019-08-05,207051797,Maxime,Very great stay on Athens. With a very beautiful seesight on the Acropolis and very close from the city centre and moving neighborhood.
30387738,507876878,2019-08-12,68434089,Vladimir,"The check-in was very easy, the location is perfect if you want to beat the queues in the morning for Acropolis, it's only 15 minutes walk! Also very close to the metro station and direct line to the airport. The flat is cute with a veranda and a view of Acropolis, all the amenities are there in case you want to cook. I really appreciated the Aircon in the hot weather. The owners are very friendly and accomodating, answering all my questions and helping along. Can only recommend!"
30387738,514435001,2019-08-21,131349099,Léa,The apartment is well located. Everything can be done by walk. Becarefull in the subway (thief) but in the area of the apartment we didn't have any problem ! Don't forget to ask for hot water. The view from the balcony is amazing !
30387738,516150472,2019-08-24,185024835,Marina,"It was a really nice apartment close to everything. We didn't met the hosts but for us it was not an inconvenient since communication was very fluent. Our flight arrived late in the night and Nikos arranged a transfer to take us to the apartment, also the driver was very friendly. The apartment had everything we needed fot our stay in Athens. Close to Monastiraki and Akropolis and direct line with the metro to the airport, with air conditioned (very important during August) and with a big balcony with a nice view from. Perhaps one bad thing is that there was only 1 roll of toilet paper for the entire stay and no coffee (we thought it was silly to buy it only for the 3 days we were staying there). In overall, very recommended!!"
30387738,518680565,2019-08-27,198199956,Helena,"A centrally located apartment with a beautiful view. Great to use as a base when exploring the city over a few days as it’s near the Acropolis and local train stations.  However, be a little cautious if arriving at night as the street is unlit and can seem a bit intimidating at first. The apartment looks a little more tired than it does in the photos, but is still excellent value for money. We did not meet the hosts, but when we had some trouble unlocking the door we called Konstantina and she was very helpful. The bed is incredibly comfy, and it is worth staying here if only for the view and the lovely balcony."
30387738,523187729,2019-09-03,31105413,Rhita,"Très bon emplacement à 20 min à pieds de l’acropole et à quelques minutes à peine du métro. <br/>Petit studio conforme aux photos, idéale pour un couple ou une personne. Très belle terrasse avec vue sur l’acropole surtout en soirée (pas d’antennes et de paraboles en vue lol)"
30387738,524513950,2019-09-06,209138754,Kelcie,Wonderful place to stay in Athens. Incredible view of the acropolis from the balcony and convenient location for shopping and restaurants. Would absolutely stay again on my next trip!

The check-in and check-out were very easy. Communication with Nikos very pleasant. He helped arrange a transfer from the airport to the apartment at the night as well. <br/>We definitely recommend this apartment for those who looking for nice place to stay and want to explore the main history gems of Athens.
30387738,530718946,2019-09-16,120016124,James,"Konstantina’s place was just as pictured.  The accommodations are simple but functional just as we’d expected.  The private balcony view of the acropolis was really nice!  Markets, restaurants, and major attractions were within walking distance which was great.  Our hosts provided a booklet of recommendations for the area as well.  We also appreciated their assistance with arranging for early morning transportation to the ferry port.  Overall it was a very nice stay and we would highly recommend."
30387738,534800426,2019-09-23,21615382,Aubrey,"Wow! Cannot say enough great things about Konstantina's place. We work in hospitality and they were AMAZING hosts, so helpful, quick to respond...they really went the extra mile for us. The location was very walkable to everything, we felt perfectly safe, even late at night. It's super close to parks and the walking path that connects most major points around the Acropolis. Great views!"
30387738,539359814,2019-10-01,18079864,Wojtek,"Perfect apartment for a couple, cozy, well equipped , clean with great location. The view from the balcony encourages for lazy drinking greek coffee."
30387738,542025281,2019-10-06,47578697,Rémi,Charming flat tastefully decorated with a big terrace offering fantsastic view on Acropole. Surrounder are authentic and pleasant and also near center and places to visit. Nikkos and Konstantina are accomodating so I found it was the authentic spirit of airbnb we meet sometimes
30387738,544060631,2019-10-09,97779327,Roberto,Ottima posizione. Vicino a metro Thissio. Zona tranquilla ma a due passi dal Museo dell Akropoli e contanti piccoli caffè e ristoranti vicino. Terrazza com vista Akropoli. Tutto pulito e ideale per un soggiorno comodo e centrale.

30387738,555778632,2019-10-28,153934019,Ana Isabel,A room with a view... <br/>Lovely apt with an amazing view to The Acropolis. <br/>The building is not new but the apt has been renovated and taken care of. Sparkling clean!<br/>Small but (Website hidden by Airbnb) me the right size as I didn't spend much time there...a lot of things and places to visit around. Very good location.<br/>Thanks to Nikos for being so helpful and such a nice person.

30387738,563532380,2019-11-13,290458064,Olga,Small but very stylish and it has the best view!
30387738,566950584,2019-11-21,37495160,Jessica,"Konstantina's place is exactly as described, with a lovely view of Acropolis from the balcony.   The host was quick to respond to my messages and came directly over when I had a slight issue with the key.   Wifi worked well (huge plus for me as I work while I travel).      The bathroom was small, but you can see that from the photos.   I'd recommend this place."
30387738,568344981,2019-11-24,49851724,Shane,So glad I stayed here while in Athens! I assumed for the price the view of the acropolis would be minimal but the view of clear and quite enjoyable! Great location within walking distance to all sights of Athens and nearby metro station only about 5 minute walk! The road is poorly lit at night but I did not feel unsafe at any point.  Will definitely be back!
30387738,569357070,2019-11-26,44659172,Argiris,"Everything was great. The place is near the metro, very clean with a stunning view of Acropolis!!!"

30387738,596303799,2020-01-22,29737427,Tutku,"Cute apartment and location is ok. Bathroom is extremely small, it is a torture to use it. Lock on the door is insecure, you can not trust it to leave your belongings in the house. For the ones who will stay here in winter: central heating system is barely working and air conditioner is not enough to heat the place. Boiler for the shower is stressful because you must always remember to open and close it. We didn't have any major problem, but it was not a comfortable experience for us."
30387738,597794564,2020-01-26,148325406,Bogdan,"Although one shouldn't expect to have the same close-up sight like in the advertised photo, which is definitely zoomed-in, the view is nonetheless amazing and you can enjoy it from the apartment's balcony.<br/>The apartment is also close to the Kerameikos metro station, about 500m, which is part of the line that connects the airport. Another close-by metro station is Thisio, next to the Ancient Agora, which you can reach after a ten minute walk. You pass through a very nice street, Iraklidon, on your way to the apartment, that features quiet small coffee shops.<br/>At this point, my first choice when visiting Athens."
30387738,604411133,2020-02-11,30417164,David,"Great location just a short walk from the Agora, metro, and the touristy areas. We rented a car and didn't find it too difficult to park on the streets. Area was safe. There is a grocery store nearby. We utilized the provided toaster oven/stove to cook our own meal. Highly recommend going in winter as all historical sites are half off!"
30387738,605672017,2020-02-15,46234847,Jessica,"Small, but well laid out, & the bed was comfortable! Definitely would recommend."

30387738,611106314,2020-02-26,107457050,Jane,Konstantina was always quick to respond with easy to follow instructions for anything we needed. The location was within walking distance from everything we wanted to see in Athens.

Σούπερ μάρκετ κοντά, φαρμακείο απέναντι. Όλα πολύ ωραία... χρειάστηκε να ακυρώσω το τελευταίο βράδυ για προσωπικούς λόγους, συνεννοηθήκαμε πολύ εύκολα με τον ιδιοκτήτη!!!"
30389613,438235224,2019-04-16,139652175,Shaylen,"The location of this Airbnb is great. Although it is important to note that you get what you pay for. The single beds were not the most comfortable, and there was a problem with ants throughout the entire apartment. For hot water, you must heat it beforehand for 20 minutes (although this seems to be consistent throughout Greece). It was not the most quiet location, and the neighbors next door played their tv throughout the night. Overall a good experience considering how much was spent to stay here if you are on a budget."
30389613,442380507,2019-04-23,20813751,Camila,The place has a great style and was very cozy and comfortable. The location is great and the check-in and check-out was pretty easy. <br/>We had a pleasant stay and we would definitely stay there again :)
30389613,450348884,2019-05-09,110947092,Gonzalo,Hermoso departamento todo a estrenar. Impecable nuestra estadía! Mobiliario nuevo y un estilo único. A 10 minutos caminando de toda actividad turística. Buen recibimiento por parte de Andrew. Muy buena comunicación. Sin dudas súper recomendado. Gracias!
30389613,452916058,2019-05-14,1824780,Sarah,"Just a fair warning: if you need the place to be quiet to sleep, you shouldn't stay there. As said in the description, it is on the low ground floor so the rooms are basically under the road. You can hear the people walking above your head, and if there's a motorcycle passing by on the road, all the apartment is shaking :-) Plus, the neighbours TV is on ALL NIGHT, which means you need earplugs to sleep in the master bedroom. Finally, there is no natural light in the living room/kitchen, because there are no windows! That's just good to know.<br/>All that being said, Alex & Andrew are great hosts, very easy to communicate with, and the apartment is well refurbished, with almost everything you need (just note that there is no regular coffee machine of French press, just a Krups machine for which you need to buy caps - we used the tea pot to make our coffee). It's very well located and cheap. So if you need a cheap, central place to stay in Athens, dont need natural night in it and have earplugs, this is the place for you ;-)"
30389613,456699480,2019-05-22,174412343,Lena,"Чудесная квартира и чудесные хозяева! Все новое, удобное, чистое и радующее глаз!"

30389613,466441071,2019-06-09,94407374,Denise,"Darya and Alex were great hosts. Their place was perfect for the short stay my friends and I had planned in Athens. We arrived late into Athens as well and I was able to seamlessly communicate with Andrew for check in purposes. He was there right away when we arrived at the apartment and gave us the step by step run down of everything we needed to know. The location of the apartment was perfect too, set far enough away from all the hustle and bustle of the Plaka and City center, but close enough to walk to either. In all, a great little place if you are visiting Athens."
30389613,468729671,2019-06-13,249848543,Kenzie,The apartment was a great place to stay if you are wanting to explore Athens. Alex was also very easy and quick to communicate with and even set up an early morning taxi to the airport for us.
30389613,474358811,2019-06-23,81335856,Inma,"El apartamento tiene cosas muy buenas y cosas muy malas.<br/>Las buenas son :<br/>Que está completamente nuevo y reformado<br/>La cercanía a Plaka y a la Acrópolis<br/>Las menos buenas es que al estar en un subsuelo, las ventanas están por debajo de la altura de la acera, la cual está pegada a las ventanas de las habitaciones.<br/>Por ello es imposible tener la ventana abierta ya q cualquier persona q pase por la acera puede verte.<br/>No es una calle muy transitada, pero aún así cuando pasa algún vehículo, sobre todo las motos , el ruido es elevado.<br/>Yo particularmente he echado de menos poder tener la persiana subida, y poder ventilar el apartamento con aire fresco.<br/>En cuanto al trato con el anfitrión ha sido excelente ya que nos dejó retrasar la hora de salida porque nuestro vuelo salía tarde .<br/>Leí una evaluación de otra huésped que decía q había un vecino q ponía la TV muy alta, es cierto, la tiene enchufada tooooda la noche y con un volumen bastante alto, he tenido q dormir con auriculares.<br/>Si hubiera estado un par de días, no me habría importado, pero hemos estado una semana y solo íbamos a dormir por la noche después de estar todo el día haciendo turismo y nos hubiera gustado descansar un poquito mejor.<br/>Las camas y las almohadas tampoco son muy cómodas."
30389613,477941240,2019-06-29,43035757,Anna,"This apartment is great! It's close to everything, has great accommodations and is extremely clean. I would definitely come back to stay. Not to mention that the host was extremely accommodating with the time we got in (flight got delayed)."

30389613,497040256,2019-07-28,121433045,Keanna,"This place is very stylish, comfortable, and not to mention, very accessible to everything. The metro stop is about a 5-minute walk, which is very convenient. Along the way, you will find many bakeries/ cafes and a few restaurants with good food. The host is very quick to respond and very helpful."
30389613,499780230,2019-08-01,13846977,Andrea,We had a great stay at Darya's appartment. It is really well located. Close to all touristic attractions.  You can walk from the apartment to Plaka which is really convenient <br/>It has everything  you need for your stay and a supermarket is close by. I recommend the place.
30389613,500979568,2019-08-03,211707434,Lorenza,"The location was great. You can walk to Plaka where there are lots of shops and restaurants/bars. The apartment is also within a reasonable walking distance to the Akropolis. The apartment was clean, modern and nicely equipped. Unfortunately we had an issue with the check-in and check-out as we had difficulties with communication. There was also a noisy neighbor which was quite unpleasant (however the host is not responsible for this)."
30389613,503583513,2019-08-06,157266799,Michelle,"The flat it’s perfect, I loved it!! it’s so close to all the interesting places."

Private and safe for me and my teen girls. <br/>We have so much fun. They also have a grocery store close to the apartment. We walk everywhere. The only negative was the “tv” only have like 4 channels (no English channels) and the signal was not good, but thanks God for Netflix. <br/>Thanks for the hospitality. I hope to come back one day. <br/>Good communication all the time."
30389613,514867999,2019-08-22,73280803,Tony,Daryas bnb was perfect for our stays in Athens. The flat was new and clean. The location was central to everything we wanted to see in Athens. Alex and Andrew were quick to communicate with me and were very accommodating with my requests. I would highly recommend this air bnb.

30389613,530719783,2019-09-16,257591529,Filippos,"Πανέμορφο διαμέρισμα, ανακαινισμένο, διακοσμημένο πολύ όμορφα, πλήρως λειτουργικό με πάρα πολλές παροχές και πεντακάθαρο. Ιδανική τοποθεσία 8 λεπτά από τον σταθμό του Μετρό σε μια πολύ ήσυχη και όμορφη γειτονιά. Το μόνο αρνητικό ότι το διαμέρισμα επειδή είναι ημιυπόγειο δεν είχε πολύ φυσικό φως κατά διάρκεια της μέρας. Στο σπίτι μας περίμενε ένα μπουκάλι κρασί, καφές και διάφορα άλλα κεράσματα. Ευχαριστούμε και θα τα ξαναπούμε σύντομα."
30389613,533886119,2019-09-22,41387577,I'Wanna,"The place is quite OK. Is near to everything. The location probably is the best. 15 mins walking from the Acropolis and 5 from the metro station. Coffee shop, bakery and two tavernas are like 3 mins walking distance. The design of the apartment is really cute. But!! There is a smell at the bathroom. There is not day light at the place. The single beds are comfortable for kids. So I will recommend the apartment for two people and two kids, no for 4 adults. My stay was comfortable and nice at all."
30389613,537813890,2019-09-29,18229387,Mihai,"We really enjoyed our stay in Alex's apartment. The location is great, really close to the historical center, while also in a more quiet neighborhood. Very clean and most of the things looked pretty new. It has all you need for longer stays and a supermarket close by. The only downside, which is mentioned in the description, is that it's located on the low ground floor so you don't get that much fresh air and light in. The check-in and check-out went very smooth."
30389613,541453329,2019-10-05,47932827,Joel,Accomodation wad great. Communication with the hosts was quickly. They were very kind with us and even they bought some food for us!! :). Also they let us to use all their machines. The location is ideal to catch the trains. We reached the Acroplis by walking. We enjoyed it a lot.

The apartment is well-kept, it has all that's necessary to spend a few days in Athens. In the neighborhood there are also supermarkets, bakers, restaurants and even a chemist, just in case one would need it. Besides, it's just a few minutes walk from the Acropolis and its nice surroundings, therefore I am glad we chose to stay at his premises."
30389613,589954343,2020-01-07,321950458,Julia,"El alojamiento cuenta con todos los servicios necesarios para tener una estadía muy grata, el anfitrión fue muy amable en tener consideración con nuestros horarios de vuelos en cuanto a hora de entrada y salida."
30389613,599754618,2020-01-31,114814786,Vladimir,"The apartment is situated 5-7 minutes walk from the metro, Zappio park and center of Athens. There is a supermarket and bakery 1 minute away - very comfortable for breakfast. <br/><br/>It fits perfectly for a family with one child - separate bedrooms, warm, cosy and equipped with everything one may need for living.<br/><br/>The only issue is one of the neighbors who watches TV pretty loud till 4 in the morning. The host mentioned it in our communication but I underestimated how disturbing this can be. Took us a while to find out who exactly it was and to communicate the wish to have less noise after 23. <br/><br/>Otherwise our stay (7 days) was seamless."

Check the AC filters before using them as they tend to clog easily with dust. Keep an eye to the small sink in the bathroom, it fills quickly with water and takes some time to drain. Recommended."

I really apreciated the flexibility of the host related to our check out timing, she was very understanding and allowed us to stay 3 extra hours in the apartment. The only inconvenient we experienced was related to the inflated floor in the master bedroom which made it hard for us to close or open the door without making a lot of noise and waking up the baby. In the end we moved in the other room and we solved this problem.<br/><br/>We would totally come back again here in the future."

The owners (Ira) was an effective communicator and the check in/out process was super easy. The location is very central which means it's easy to walk everywhere, which was useful. There are cafes and small restaurants at the square, however, the selection is quite limited so you do need to walk at least 15-25 minutes to get to areas where there is a really vibrant night/street life and a large variety of good restaurants and cafes. Taxis are also plentiful. We enjoyed our stay!"

The metro was very close and accessible.  There was a grocery store, a bakery, a juice bar, pharmacy and many other shops within meters of the apartment.  The walls are thin but noise wasn’t an issue for us.  I felt as if our son was the one making the noise and we tried to keep it down.  This was a great value and we would recommend this city apartment."

The hosts were very easy to reach and responsive. Oleg met us upon arrival and gave us a quick tour of the apartment and a list of suggestions of things to do. The location is very convenient but is also a bit sketchy as the sun goes down and throughout the night. This is the only negative aspect to the apartment but it is quite significant from the visitor point of view and should not be left out of the review. Otherwise, we had no issue whatsoever with our stay. Thank you Oleg and others for a comfortable and lovely stay."

The location was nice and the host was very accommodating and always ready to help or answer questions. I felt very welcome. The apartment is very trendy and welcoming/homy at the same time.

30390777,456195491548494093,2021-09-21,7568404,Lewis,Very nice spacious flat with everything you need to use as a good base to explore Athens. Good location with the entire city reachable by foot if you are up for a bit of a walk (25 min max). Metro also within 100m of the apartment and good restaurants/supermarkets right on the doorstep. Hosts were extremely hospitable and allowed us to check out late on our last day - would definitely recommend.
30390777,462066973086363772,2021-09-29,113514885,Sol,"We really enjoyed our stay in this Airbnb. It had everything we needed and Ira and Oleg were very nice and responsive. Also, it had a location close to cafés, small shops, supermarkets, metro and train station.<br/><br/>You can walk 2 minutes and get to the  nearest metro station. From there, you can get to the center in less than 8 minutes. You can also take a nice walk to the center, which takes around 25-30 minutes. In case you want to visit Meteora, the train station is a 10-minute walk from the apartment. So, the location is very convenient.<br/><br/>The check-in was easy, thanks to Ira’s instructions and to Oleg’s help. The apartment was clean and cozy. The kitchen, living room and bedrooms were super nice. From the balcony, you can get a feeling of the local lifestyle. <br/><br/>The only thing that was a little uncomfortable was the bathroom, but it might be because we were not used to the style. I only mention it in case it might be an issue for some people with functional diversity and/or who might struggle with needing more space to take a shower. <br/><br/>Other than that, this Airbnb was perfect and it made our visit to Athens very enjoyable!<br/><br/>Thank you so much Ira and Oleg!"

When I first stumbled upon this flat on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. George is the most thoughtful, gracious host. He provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The flat is just perfect! Kitchen is compact and contains everything one needs.I felt like home! Location is incredible, such a cool neighborhood, walking distance for bars, restaurants and metro station . Top-notch AirBnB experience, polite and accurate communication combined with elegant and excellent located apartment. 100% recommendation! George thanks for everything :) You're a top man! We will be back!"

The location is literally a block and a half from the Metro station and 2-3 Metro stops or a 30 min walk from all of the major sites and shops. The neighborhood was quiet and the surrounding views are amazing. I am already planning my return to Athens and will definitely stay here again.

30394146,552195895,2019-10-21,127763622,Sarah,We booked this place for alot of reasons. One being I had a conference at the hilton hotel and this airbnb was maybe 5 mins away. The restaurants are around the corner are amazing! There is a hotspot at the royal when you leave the airbnb and dont have wifi. This airbnb was amazing. So clean. And felt comfortable. It was so helpful to have a washing machine there. Meant we didn't have to pack as much stuff which is always a bonus! We accidentally locked ourselves out of the apartment the night we were supposed to pack up and leave. I messaged Vassilis-Giwrgos's and almost immediately was able to work out a plan to get us back into the apartment! Overall an amazing space. An amazing host! Would definitely stay there again when in athens!!

30394146,563212777,2019-11-12,218377395,Charles,I stayed here leading up to and a couple of days after the Athens Marathon. This apartment is in the perfect location for people running the marathon or people just looking to experience Athens. It is a five-minute walk to the Evangelismos metro station and very close to a number of restaurants and bars. The apartment was very clean and the host provided us with their local recommendations for food and coffee. Overall a great stay.

Die Wohnung liegt im Souterrain mit einem kleinen Vorgarten, hat große Fenster, die mit einem Blickschutz vor neugierigen Blicken geschützt sind. Alles ist blitzsauber und modern eingerichtet. Da es in den Nächten fast gefroren hat, war toll, daß sich ab 19 h die Heizung eingeschaltet und uns eine mollig warme Wohnung empfangen hat. Es waren ausreichend warme Decken im Bett. Die Dusche lieferte schön heißes Wasser, alles war für eine Woche im Winter mit Regen und Kälte perfekt. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind gut zu Fuß zu erreichen. Die Bushaltestelle zum Shuttle-Bus am Hilton Hotel 6 min. entfernt. In den Straßen waren die Bitterorangen, die hier in Massen wachsen, erntereif. Das war im Februar ein unglaublicher Anblick. Athen zu dieser Zeit ist toll, wenn man eine so nette Wohnung wie diese hat. Keine Warteschlangen in den Museen,  die Strassen und Restaurants nicht überfüllt. Gerne wieder!"

The location is great because you can basically walk to all spots in Athens. If you are lazy, a taxi ride is usually around 3-4 Euros. Some nice restaurants and bars are located close by. When we had a problem with the fridge, Vassilis replaced it immediately. We had a good time there."

The landlord is also very enthusiastic, because there is no hot water in the middle of the night to practice the landlord, very patient to solve the problem. The only minor flaw is that the water heater doesn't always provide hot water and needs to be reset on the balcony. The house is quite nice."

30415140,457967233,2019-05-25,52498281,Delphine,"Appartement très fonctionnel, tout à fait conforme aux photos, très propre. Par contre, pas d’accueil, nous n’avons rencontré personne pendant trois semaines. L’accès à l’immeuble se fait par code, l’appartement aussi. C’est dommage pour un Airbnb.<br/>Le quartier est très très sympa. Je recommande vivement mais il faut revoir l’accueil"
30415140,460423602,2019-05-29,232783191,Janae,"This place exceeded our expectations! It is stylish, clean, and the perfect place to stay in athens. The whole building is owned by the same company so you feel safe. The beds are comfortable. It’s a quick walk to the center of Athens. Had laundry machine on site, as well as a workout gym and play place for kids. Everything in the apartment was well thought out and it was a seamless stay. Amazing place and would definitely stay again!"

30415140,467244654,2019-06-10,26110334,Mary,"Our stay in this apartment could not have been a better experience. It was so comfortable,  very clean, and well equipped. Each bedroom, kitchen and living room had access to the balcony which was well used. At first I tough location may be a problem but it turned out that we actually loved being a little bit away from the hustle and bustle of the Center area. We walked everywhere, sometimes a challenge but always worth it. Information on everything local was provided. Grocery store / coffee shop and a wonderful bakery just one block away. Facilities at the apartment were excellent, wonderful laundry, ( if you Must on vacation !) a nice gym and a play room for young children. Beds were comfy with good pillows, good towels and great showers. I would highly recommend this apartment. Communication was easy and I always felt I could contact management if there was a problem, thank fully we did not and we had a most wonderful 4 nights in Athens.<br/>Thank you to Mary and Esmeralda"
30415140,472758453,2019-06-20,223097121,Waylon,This is a wonderful place to stay.  We were a family of eight and had plenty of room.  The house is within walking distance of many of Athens' historical sights with plenty of restaurants close by.  You should definitely book your next stay here.
30415140,484099110,2019-07-08,7659601,Sagar,"The Hercules apartments is a great place to stay with a family while visiting Athens.  The Aegeus stables apartment was stylish, roomy, and fully stocked.  The AC works great and check-in/access was a breeze.  The neighborhood felt safe and quiet, compared to other parts of the city.  They even have a bakery, grocery store, veggie stand, and multiple restaurants within 2-3 blocks which is super convenient.  They provide a washer and dryer (including detergent, all free) and children's playroom which was very appreciated.  This has been one of the best AirBnBs we have stayed at.  Overall we greatly enjoyed our visit and would definitely stay here again.   Thanks Mary!"

30415140,497201969,2019-07-28,271412089,Sekhar,Wonderfully maintained and definitely high class amenities.  Airbnb apartments are meant to bring family and friends together during the vacations and we friends made maximum use of all amenities. The hostess team of Esmeralda  Mary  and Liliana was prompt in responding to our requests.  Unfortunately could not meet any of them . On the whole it is a highly recommended place on Airbnb in Athens . The best part was a gym and facility for washing machine and a printer at the basement.  There is an elevator too not mentioned so it is adult and disabled friendly too. On the whole a 'thumbs up '
30415140,508565577,2019-08-13,25566566,Leslie,"This apartment was a great find. Very nicely decorated and clean with comfortable beds. It was extra nice having a bathroom in each room as well! We were able to walk to the Acropolis very easily from here. Our host was Iliana as the regular host was on vacation.

El lugar es muy lindo y cuidan cada detalle. Las anfitrionas se tardan un poco en responder y en mi caso me pidieron varias veces la misma información. Fuera de eso creo que el lugar es genial. Sin duda regresaría."

30415140,554355604,2019-10-26,88884517,Derina And Ray,"This was a work trip with two colleagues. The apartment was like a 5* hotel. Beautifully appointed, clean - exactly what we needed. Communication before and during our stay was excellent. The only negative occurred upon check out when we paid an extra €10 to store our bags for the day - the instructions and lock were not left for us as promised, and when I enquired, I received a message that, as it was the weekend, Esmeralda would not be coming to the building. We left our luggage unlocked and all was good thankfully! I would still very much recommend the apartment and hosts."
30415140,557461254,2019-11-01,208739436,Charlotte,Good location with only a 10-15 minute walk into the main square.<br/>Every room has its own en suite and there is another bathroom accessed via the main sitting room.<br/>Very clean and modern with little extras in the kitchen to help with cooking- much appreciated.

30415140,607043912,2020-02-17,48175752,Linda,"This place is what I'm going to call a hidden gem.  We took the Subway and walked so when walking you may think in your head what kind of space is this going to be - blah, blah, blah - however.  This loft surpassed my expectations.  The wrap around balcony I loved.  Even though we didn't get to use it much because it was a little chilly but it was still a nice touch.  We got there about an hour early and were able to check in right away.  I loved the fact that we didn't need a key - so we didn't have to worry about losing keys everything was operated by a keypad.  Each room had it's own bathroom and shower as stated."

30415140,393245023750201123,2021-06-26,5881004,Jocelyn,"This place was a steal! We had three bedrooms, three ensuite bathrooms, a large living space (plus another full bathroom), a well equipped gym, free laundry in the basement, and a playroom for kids downstairs. I could hardly believe the price we were paying compared to what our friends paid in Plaka. <br/><br/>That said, the trade off is that you are a bit further away from many of the tourist sites / well known restaurants (20-25 minutes walking). This is usually no problem for us because we love walking, but it was 100 degrees the two days we stayed and getting to and from places was a really hot endeavor. You really have to commit to being out in the city once you leave your apartment. <br/><br/>The host, Esmerelda, is quick to respond. She helps you set up a taxi service to and from the airport, which was so helpful."

The neighbourhood is calm and the location is stone's throw away from plaka central area. Dana is an excellent host, and her communication was to the point in all respects. Overall, loved our stay here :)"

30415627,482887881,2019-07-07,19709546,Chris,A location second to none. Steps away from the ruins of antiquity as well as good bars and restaurants. Kat was great with communication and did her best to welcome us.

30415627,485039419,2019-07-10,123922247,Martijn,"Very nice and clean appartment in the heart of Athens. The Acropolis was within 5 minutes walk. Plaka, where the appartment is situated is a very cozy neighbourhood with a lot of (good!!) restaurants and cafes. The communication was great and we felt valuated. Very much recommend this appartment :)"
30415627,486271189,2019-07-12,5536683,Taylor,"Dana and Kat's apartment was perfect, and they were extremely accommodating. They even helped us arrange a taxi to the airport on the morning of our departure, which eased any stress we might have had about the beginning of our return trip. Would recommend this space!"
30415627,490102533,2019-07-18,233761782,Zoe,This was a great place to stay in. It's quite small so perfect for short stays. The accomodation is very close to the acropolis and has lots of nice shops and markets in the side streets nearby. Communication from Kat and Dana is excellent.

Kat nos orientou muito bem e tudo ocorreu conforme as suas indicações. A localização é incrível, realmente um diferencial. Se um dia eu voltar à Atenas e, eu espero que isso aconteça, certamente irei procurá-la novamente.<br/>O bairro de Plaka é incrível, o apartamento é perfeito para um casal e próximo de tudo, meu marido e eu conseguimos fazer todos os passeios caminhando."

30415627,531649870,2019-09-18,5882327,Anita,"We loved the location!! The apartment was small and very charming, a wonderful taste of Plaka! I couldn’t think of a better location for walking around Plaka and seeing the sites. I highly recommend purchasing the combo ticket for the Acropolis and nearby sites; they are all within walking distance. We had quite a bit of trouble with WiFi the first two days of our trip which made planning a big challenging, but the host supplied us with a new router on the last day that did work. Overall a amazing stay! Highly recommend."

Tout est beau, pratique et confortable. L'arrivée peut se faire à n'importe quelle heure, grâce à des codes d'accès. <br/>Le quartier est très pratique, à proximité directe de tous les sites. Il y a des commerces dans la rue d'à côté. <br/>Et les enfants ont adoré l'aire de jeux du sous-sol !"
30416134,704387703,2020-10-27,127487267,Fiona,"Great place to stay, 2 good size bedrooms with comfy beds and plenty of storage. The kitchen was very well equipped and you can easily seat 6 for dinner. A large terrace overlooks a side street where you can watch the world go by. The location is great, surrounded by lots of shops, bars and restaurants. We stayed for 5 days and could have stayed here a lot longer. Thank you!"

30416134,404018179996724462,2021-07-11,75659043,Kai,"One of the most optimally designed AirBnb experiences I’ve had: everything was new, flawless, high tech and organized in a perfectly easy design flow. Check-in was seamless, and it was the perfect base for us to attend my friend’s event at the Acropolis within walking distance. <br/><br/>Safe street, adorable old lady neighbour in the building across the street who befriended us, walkable location / easy to grab a taxi or uber, cafes and markets in all directions, easy to order delivery. Comfortable, stylish furniture in a spacious, sunny, airy apartment. 10/10 recommend and would stay again.<br/><br/>Notable positives: two huge balconies, with screen doors! There is a buzzer if you need to buzz a guest or food delivery up to the unit. <br/><br/>Negatives: Spotty wifi sometimes. The biggest complaint is that the air pollution from lack of ventilation in the building’s basement downstairs is neurotoxic; do not do laundry or you might lose some brain cells."

30416472,702916678,2020-10-23,195964373,Sean,Great studio apartment in a decent location less than 10 minute walk to Monastiraki station. Lovely amenities including a gym and washroom. Apartment clean throughout with all necessary appliances and utensils etc. Would recommend for sure!

The apartment is stylish, really well thought out use of space.  A large balcony has sun all day.  I loved the gym down stairs, it is free to use and is really well stocked.  Also this price was very cheap.<br/><br/>I can only recommend!"

30416472,730163331,2021-02-10,49322042,Zaria,"This place is fantastic. I stayed for a month as a solo traveller- it was clean, comfortable, safe and in a perfect location. Super comfy double bed and a sofa bed if you're more than 1 or 2. Has everything you need and a cute little balcony. The gym is great (also very clean and has covid rules in place). The check-in was straight forward and contact-free, and Mary and Esmeralda were very responsive to any queries I had throughout my stay and very friendly. The rotating TV was a really clever touch too! Would definitely recommend and look forward to visiting again!"
30416472,735654575,2021-03-01,372770015,Κρίστη,Πολύ ωραίος χώρος και καθαρό!
30416472,742299428,2021-03-26,390627845,Christos,"I gotta say that the room we stayed in was quite dirty when we arrived. It was obvious that someone had changed the bedsheets and towels but the floor and other surfaces were extremely dirty. Even so, we communicated this to the host and she made sure to send someone to clean the place up. Another thing we would like to mention is that before our arrival we were sent strict instructions about the gym. Once we got there, more than 3 people were working out at once, without masks, without towels in place or sometimes without shoes and shirts. We found this specially bad since the host made it a point to mention that the apartment complex is disinfected, which is clearly not the case.<br/><br/>Even so, we had a great time at her place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located. Would absolutely recommend to stay here, just make sure to watch the cleanliness of the room/gym when you arrive."
30416472,748815125,2021-04-15,23713083,Roi,best value for money!
30416472,755518854,2021-05-06,295873158,Takis,εκπληκτικό μέρος διαμονής.!!!
30416472,390961287597974189,2021-06-23,10923927,Michael,"These people were soooo condescending and mean from the start. The building is a flop house, not quiet and the things being offered are the very things in short supply. Once you book with the host you’re handed off to a sort of sub host. I got a woman named Esmerelda who could not have been more childish and patronizing. Such a bummer. <br/><br/>I had booked the place so I could watch Netflix at the tail end of my trip and get some rest. Netflix didn’t work, and even the “live tv” would cut out, which the host told me “worked before you got there,” as if it were my fault fro having arrived. No solution was ever provided. I really can’t tell you just how toxic these folks were.<br/><br/>A lot of kids stay in this building, there were people yelling angrily in the halls, smoking on the balcony, and banging the walls till 2am. I even had a mysterious fluid thrown on me from the roof. <br/><br/>I have stayed at 50 or 60 Airbnbs and have only had five or six bad experience. This definitely ranks in those top five just by virtue of the rudeness alone, before everything else fell short. If you’re a kid in your early 20s maybe this will be a cool place to flop, but I got a full quiet apartment in a better location earlier in my trip for the same price. Don’t be fooled by the promise of Netflix: if it doesn’t work you’ll just be insulted for asking for a fix."
30416472,397550157182410398,2021-07-02,164291562,Matthias,"We stayed at this beautiful accommodation for 3 days and it was a great experience. This room has everything one needs: starting with a balcony, air conditioning, variety of cooking materials (2x toasters, coffee machine, pans, etc). The communication with the hosts is also easy and nice. To sum up, we can definitely recommend this accommodation for everyone who wants to visit Athens. Beautiful and very cozy Apartment!"

Inside also you will have everything you need for vacation or work trip, even more.  One negative point is very late check in… but it’s indicated on annoncement so you have to be ready to walk around if you arrive very early."

I personally like to stay little away from tourist spot. Because I want to sleep quickly and soundly. This is a perfect place.

It's perfectly located with stations of all the 3 metro lines within 10 minutes walking distance and the Acropolis and Agora in 20 minutes. The neighbourhood is quiet, safe and relaxed, bakery and supermarket are close.<br/><br/>Communication with Esmeralda was great, friendly, fast and easy. The studio has a large balcony that we enjoyed very much and lots of other practical details. There are helpful ideas and recommendations where to go for eating or for a drink. <br/><br/>We would definitely come back to this place and will also recommend it to friends!"

30419466,405381073,2019-01-27,234499744,Neta,Anna's place is located within a few minutes to all the main tourist attractions. Very Central in a beautiful neighborhood close to restaurants at the foot of the acropolis. The house offers several sleeping arrangements which is great for large groups or family. The facilities were amazing and clean. Anna responds quickly and is very accommodating. Highly recommended!

30419466,428876015,2019-03-26,5002169,Robin,"This is a great place to stay in a charming part of the center of Athens. The location is such that you can walk to all major sites, which is indeed something we enjoyed doing. That said, the street where the place is located gets a lot of pedestrian tourist traffic, so might be noisy in the highest season, e.g. July and August. The house is fairly well insulated from the noise, so I don't think it's a problem the rest of the year. There are three bedrooms, of which one is on the inner courtyard, which is really very quiet. So if you are only using one or two of the bedrooms, you can avoid the (lovely) one which however faces the street,  if you noise sensitive.<br/>Anna is a great host. Always ready to give a quick response to questions, but never obtrusive. I arrived early in the morning and she made the effort to get the cleaning staff to clean up one bedroom first so I could sleep and rest after a middle-of-the-night flight. I really appreciated that extra effort!<br/>A word about sleeping arrangements. There are three double bedrooms. One has a queen mattress, en suite bathroom with shower, and is on the inner courtyard. Another with double mattress is on the street side (see above), and has a bathroom (shower) which is shared with the third bedroom (2 twin beds). The twin-bed bedroom does not have a window to the outside world and is quite basic. This would be most suitable for children or two young people- it's not super-comfy, but fine. There is also sleeping space in the attic room upstairs, which is very charming, but which requires walking through the second bedroom. <br/>The kitchen is nice and well-equipped, though we had trouble making decent coffee. That said, with all the lovely caffes around, it was not a big problem, and differences in coffee preferences are huge. There was an espresso machine and a drip maker, but the latter was not top quality, so there was a bit of dripping. But these are really petty issues and are more than compensated for by the great location, charming feel of the place, great host, and generally nice atmosphere of the place.<br/>I would definitely go back!"

The house was just perfect for our big family group (4 adults and 4 teens), so comfortable and well equipped. Cosy atmosphere and plenty of room for everyone! We enjoyed chit chatting in the big dining room planning our visits to the nearby museums over a nice cup of Nespresso coffee whilst our children could listen to music and play in the big attic.<br/>The location of the house is great, even better than our expectations as we could reach on foot every spot of interest in Athens.<br/>Thanks Anna for recommending Cafe Melina next door for breakfast, a real plus for all of us!"

Able to walk to most of the major attractions...and on rooftop bars on the street you get a fantastic view of the Acropolis. There are loads of bars and restaurants on the street which is very convenient but can be a little noisy at night if you have a room at the front of the house. Would definitely stay there again!

It was very central to restaurants and shopping (there’s literally a cafe right outside the door), and we loved hearing the street musicians at night. I will say it felt a little more dated than the photos showed, but this wasn’t any issue at all and the amazing location and amenities (like the washer and dryer in the kitchen!), and not to mention how helpful Anna was at arranging transport for us and answering any questions we had means we would most definitely stay here again next time we’re in Athens."

30419467,521611001,2019-09-01,51059410,Praba,"I stayed at Ioanna’s place for 8 days during a conference. Her daughter Eleni was the person I corresponded with from the onset. Eleni was absolutely incredible. She provided me with all the correct information on the proximity of the AirBnb to the Conference Centre, how to get around Athens and answered my numerous questions when it was already extremely late in Athens. I also booked another AirBnB in the building for my colleague and she too was extremely pleased with the Eleni and the extent she went to in making our stay comfortable. Both Eleni and Markos fetched us from the metro and took us to the accommodation. I am currently in Santorini and she arranged to keep my bag for me and I will fetch it when I get back to fly home. Furthermore she also accommodated me by letting me check out a little later. <br/><br/>The supermarkets and some eating places are walking distance from the apartment, and that was very convenient. The bus to the airport is a short walk from the apartment and that was also very convenient and a plus. One could also take the metro which is a little longer of a walk if you have heavy bags. However to travel around to the tourist sights, the metro was quick and convenient. <br/><br/>Eleni also had fruit, and breakfast supplies for us on arrival. <br/><br/>Eleni was more than just a super host. If in Athens again I will most definitely book this AirBnB. Thank you to Eleni for making my stay an enjoyable one."

Eleni wasn’t in the country during my stay but she gave me a contact in the same building. Mark was very nice and welcoming and answered all my questions very quickly. <br/>The fridge stopped working during my stay.

The apartment is in a great location and we were able to find street parking which was a bonus.

30438690,498654687,2019-07-30,151859249,Simona,"Definitely recommended! This was my best experience with AirBnb. I had such a good time in Athens thanks to Alex and his father, Stephan, who took care of everything I needed for a nice 1,5 month long stay in Greece. <br/>The apartment was very clean, quiet, stylish, it has a nice kitchen, bathroom, an amazing view on the city ( also the Acropolis), It has it’s own rooftop for relaxing or having a dinner with friends.<br/><br/> I got nice recommendations for restaurants, interesting places to visit and when I needed some help, Stephan was more than helpful with everything. As I was staying in the apartement for longer term, Stephan also managed some cleaning for me. <br/>From the beginning I had no wifi, because it wasn’t included, but based on my wishes they managed  it for me, which I appreciated a lot. <br/><br/>In conclusion I was very happy with my choice, even though I had some doubts before coming to Athens. I was the first tenant of this apartement, so I didn’t know what to expect. Meanwhile, It was over my expectations. I would definitely come back again. For one person or a couple it’s the best choice. <br/><br/>Thank you a lot."

30438690,765586430,2021-06-02,23261492,Thomas,"L'appartement est tout à fait très bien : je me suis senti comme chez moi pendant un séjour de cinq semaines.<br/><br/>La situation est excellente, à la frontière entre les quartiers d'Exarchia et Kolonaki qui sont très vivants et animés, avec un grand choix de boutiques, de bars et de restaurants (le bruit s'étend un peu tard le weekend). Un camion de CRS est posté en permanence à l'entrée de l'immeuble, mais je n'ai jamais eu aucun problème. L'immeuble se situe au pied du Lycabette (je vous conseille d'y monter, il offre une superbe vue sur la ville), à 20min de marche de la place centrale de Syntagma et 30min de l'Acropole. Les stations de métro les plus proches sont Panepistemio et Omonia.<br/><br/>L'appartement est propre et bien équipé. La cuisine comprend un four, des plaques, un frigo, la vaisselle nécessaire. La petite salle de bain est suffisante. La pièce principale est composée d'une table avec deux chaises et d'un canapé-lit. Il y a de nombreux rangements, la climatisation, le wifi, un étendoir, un fer et une planche à repasser, un aspirateur, le nécessaire de ménage. <br/>Un petit balcon privé donne sur le Lycabette. Comme l'appartement est situé au septième et dernier étage, il n'y a qu'à traverser le palier pour rejoindre le grand toit-terrasse commun de l'immeuble, mais où il n'y a presque personne, sauf parfois le weekend. Il offre une vue sur les toits d'Athènes en direction du coucher de soleil, et de l'autre côté sur l'Acropole.<br/><br/>Dimitris m'a accueilli en personne et m'a fait visiter l'appartement. Nous nous sommes ensuite contactés par (Hidden by Airbnb) , mais ça n'a pas été souvent nécessaire. Il a été disponible, réactif et sympathique."

У нас было очень позднее прибытие, такси не брали, метро не работало, поэтому прогулялись от Синтагмы (были без багажа) до квартиры без проблем. <br/><br/>Очень большим плюсом в такой ситуации как наша - есть возможность самостоятельного поселения с помощью минисейфа (не нужно напрягать хозяина). Это оказалось легко и просто по инструкциям хозяйки.<br/><br/>Рядом с жильем за углом есть прекрасная кондитерская с кофе и выпечкой, работающая до позднего вечера (22.00) и минимаркет. В пяти минутах ходьбы есть отличный супермаркет с хорошими ценами ( Адрес: Evdoxou 1, Athina 117 43, Греция с 8.00 до 21.00) <br/><br/>Квартира чистая, есть все необходимое, даже фен и утюг. Хозяйка Марина помогла нам советами перед поездкой.<br/><br/>Отличный вариант для знакомства с Афинами для бюджетных путешественников. Рекомендую!"

One of the things that made my experience so good, was to come home after a long day of work every night to a beautiful, clean and comfy apartment. I've had contact with Laszlo now and then and he was always quick with responses and happy to help me. I love the neighborhood a lot. A very nice bakery on the corner where I get my coffee in de mornings, and sometimes a home-cooked Greek meal to eat at the apartment. (Great kitchen utensils as well btw). On Mondays we have a market behind the apartment with fresh fruits and local products. I even became friends with the guy from the laundry :) <br/>Overall it is just a very quiet, peaceful street just next to the center! I can be anywhere in no time with my bike. And btw, there is weekly free cleaning of the apartment what is very comfortable as well.<br/>I love the people here,  nature, the food, everything! I will definitely come back to Athens with my friends for holiday when corona is over, and for sure at Laszlo's place!<br/><br/>Thanks for everything"

The apartment is located in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. As a solo female traveler I felt very comfortable living there and coming home at night alone. You have everything you need close by (supermarkets, metro and even a market on mondays - which I highly recommend you check out). The city center isn't  far away, you can walk to it (20mins) or take the metro (5mins). The apartment itself was sparkling clean. The bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was well equipped.

30454502,414306218,2019-02-19,95252885,Deya,The apartment was very well located within walking distance of many attractions and amenities. Having a place to park a few minutes walk from the apartment makes it good value but if you don't have a car then it is a bit expensive. The kitchen was very well equipped. We visited in February which meant it was cold. The central heating did not work so both bathroom and kitchen were very cold. The living room and bedroom had an air conditioning unit which worked well to heat both rooms. The shower is a handheld arrangement with no shower curtain. Overall it is a good flat only let down by the cold bathroom with the handheld shower head. This probably not a big deal if you visit in the summer.

Logement conforme à la description avec l’équipement nécessaire. <br/>Malheureusement le réveil avec 3 cafards nous a refroidit (2 plus ou moins vifs et un trop vif !). D’après l’hôte, cela était du à une désinfection récente au sein de l’immeuble. <br/>Mais nous n’oublions pas l’amabilité de notre hôte, merci à lui."

Awesome location for exploring Athens. Host was great to work with and responded quickly. Thanks for a great visit! My only tip is for American visitors: the bathroom is European style, which means no enclosed shower. Which may be the case for just places around here, and it's not bad, just be aware."

It has everything we need to feel at home and is close to all the main attractions in Athens so we didn’t have to use public tranportation during our stay there. The host Antzey was extremely helpful, kind and very quick to respond with any questions. The first night we arrive everything was closed and he drove us around to find a supermarket and checked in on us regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!"

30454502,461154395,2019-05-31,439638,Sumit,It was a pleasure to stay here on our first trip to Athens. The location is just perfect .. just like the title says.. it's only a few minutes walk to Acropolis and Plaka (lot of places to eat shop and stroll). Also you have to go to the roof to get some amazing views of the Acropolis.
30454502,461675771,2019-06-01,21165206,Alkesh,Great kind hosts. Best location adjacent to acropolis

It is located convenient in the city center and it was easy to reach from the metro station. The metro station Acropoli is just one stop from the blue line which goes directly to the airport.<br/><br/>We called to the host 10 min in advance and he met us near the entrance, shown the apartment and provided to us some tips about the neighbourhood. The apartment is located in a quiet street so no issues with the noise. Beds are a bit too hard (but it was ok for my husband). It was nice to find a bottle of water in the fridge and some snacks in the kitchen.<br/><br/>The host was very friendly and kept our luggage during the next day as our flight was quite late and we took that opportunity to explore the city and visit Acropolis which is in walking distance<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good one-night stay for us."

We dropped off our bags early (which was very nice!)  however when we came back to get the keys and check in- nobody answered the bell.  We checked ahead of time to ask if it was ok to come back like 4:00.  He said fine.  So when we showed up and nobody answered I had to make an international phone call to contact the host.  Then he had to contact his dad, who finally came and let us in.  Also the apartment needed to be cleaned a little better-  tub and bathroom sink wasn't clean.  Also we found a dead cockroach in the bedroom."

The Airline lost my mother's luggage and I gave his number and he was all the time talking to them to control de status until he finally received it and immediately gave it to us, which was great because we only had a day in Athens.  Also helped with reserving a taxi because the previously appointed did not responded and he was awake after midnight to check that the taxi driver came for us.  He is great!"

30454502,536592772,2019-09-27,79124306,Ash,"Brilliant apartment really close to the Acropolis and central Athens. Good value for the location. Parking is limited to vehicles under 2.28m high, but there is also free street parking (though it’s busy and hard to find a spot). Communication was easy, thanks for a great stay."

The communication was on point and Andreas even showed us around and gave us a lot of extra Tipps! The apartment is very close to the city.

30454502,554280610,2019-10-26,174426156,Cármen,"We stayed at the apartment on our last day in Greece, and the location was great to make the most of that time. Really close to the Acropolis and Plaka.

Place is definitely not 7 minutes walk to Acropolis, but 16 minutes; although, in our case it's okay since it's close to the main road and to the place where we rented our car. Overall, it's a good experience."
30454502,559518540,2019-11-04,265328355,Paul,"Excellent location, very near the Acropolis and the Plaka. It even comes with a parking space, which is amazing considering the location!

I was only here for a quick overnight, but it's a lovely place and I would have happily spent more time in a warmer season. <br/><br/>We visited in late April and found it to be very cold, with a space heater that didn't help much. But had we packed some sweaters, it might not have been so bad. <br/><br/>Otherwise, a great base for exploring Athens!"

30461387,446714774,2019-05-02,43538236,Dan,"The apartment is in a good location, within easy reach of the sights. The free parking is a big plus and the view from the balcony of the Acropolis is great. Although clean, the apartment is very old fashioned and would benefit from updating. However, it was quite comfortable and we had an enjoyable stay. Communication was generally good although there was a misunderstanding about what to do with the key on leaving and this led to owner being accidentally locked out! There must also have been a misunderstanding about sleeping arrangements as only one bed was made up on arrival though this was quickly sorted."

There is a supermarket close to hand in one direction and some great places to eat in the other direction just 3 minutes walk away. The view from two of the three terraces is fabulous if you are into things Parthaenon. We ate breakfast outside on all 3 days of our visit. The walk to all  the main sites is very reasonable, about 10-15 minutes. My suggestion is that you stay for at least 3-4 days."

Nous avons dormi à 5 personnes ( 2 lits 140 + 1 lit simple) et nous étions a l'aise. Le salon est agréable. Il y a des fenêtres partout. Très facile d'aller à pied au musée de l'Acropole et à Plaka. Petits déjeuners et dîners sur la terrasse bien abritée du soleil avec vue sur la colline de l'Acropole ...nous sommes enchantés. Socrates et sa famille sont vraiment tres attentifs  au confort des résidents, une authentique adresse où nous reviendrons lors de notre prochain voyage en Grèce, c'est sûr."

30461387,476345702,2019-06-26,62966397,Fiona,"Well located flat with great view. We stayed only one night. The bathtub/shower area could be improved (e.g. a wall hook for the shower head), but otherwise fine. Appreciated being met promptly by the host and the lonely planet guide with key information highlighted."
30461387,480261267,2019-07-02,261423,Jovana,Fabulous location. View is so amazing. Communication great
30461387,481670639,2019-07-05,188185704,Rositsa,The place is convenient for seeing the historical sites. It is clean and can accommodate up to 5 people. There is no information about the access to the apartment via email or through Airbnb. The visitors need to have the host’s phone number ready to call upon arrival which is a bit inconvenient as one has to wait for the key.

Il y a tout ce qu il faut pour qu on se sente bien chez Socrates - de plus il a pris le temps de nous donner pleins de supers conseils , des bonnes adresses, et il a été très arrangeant pour notre arrivée et notre départ !

Point fort : la terrasse avec sa vue imprenable sur le site de l’Acropole, encore plus appréciable la nuit car illuminée."

Sehr freundlich und humorvoll. Die Einrichtung ist sehr alt. Daher ist der Preis meines Erachtens zu hoch. Für uns das klare Plus und daher in unserer Situation wieder: ein Parkplatz direkt gegenüber unter dem Haus wo Socrates wohnt. Der Blick vom Balkon auf die Akropolis ist schön."

30461387,670778701,2020-10-04,12561706,Ingrida,The apartments are in a great spot with a terrace to the Acropolis. Neighborhood is nice and safe. Also there is a convenient parking spot. Apartments are clean and spacious. We stayed only for one night so we had no problems. Maybe if we stayed for longer the bathroom and the kitchen wouldn't be too comfortable.

30461387,761306873,2021-05-23,2427762,Audre,"Fantastic place!! The apartment is very cozy, everything is clean and looks freshly painted. It is also well-equipped, which shows that the place is not just made to be rented out for the cheapest cost possible, but rather meant to be like a home away from home. One of the two bedrooms, the kitchen and the living room all open up to the massive patio with Acropolis views! We spent every morning and evening there, admiring the view. Socrates greeted us at the door, he was very friendly and hospitable. All in all, the apartment is fantastic and I would definitely stay there again!"

Le salon et les chambres sont très fonctionnels, seuls la cuisine et la salle de bain sont légèrement petite.<br/>L'hôte parle le français parfaitement et pourra vous conseiller une guide, française, qui pourra vous faire visiter l'Acropole, les agoras ou alors des musées suivant le forfait choisi avec des explications passionnantes et très complètes sur la mythologie et la vie durant l'antiquité.<br/>Durant notre séjour, le wifi était assez mauvais, mais Socrates nous a prêter une carte Sim pour remédier au problème.<br/>je recommande largement cet appartement!"

Tout en étant au calme."

Der nächtliche Blick auf die erleuchtete Akropolis von der kleinen Terrasse aus an sich ist schon unbezahlbar. Und man kann tatsächlich in 10-12 Minuten zur Akropolis hochlaufen. Das Apartment ist sehr gut gelegen, sehr zentral und trotzdem eher ruhig."

A 10 minutes à pieds de l'Acropole et du centre touristique d'Athènes, la vue hypnotisante du Parthénon la nuit depuis la terrasse et l'excellente communication de Socrates (et l'accueil en français de son papa!) sont autant d'atouts pour ce logement. Nous y avons passé une nuit, mais nous aurions pu y rester une semaine sans problème."

This one, by far, has the best view of the Acropolis! It is a little difficult to get to by car, but then, so is the rest of Athens!! The area has some great restaurants (and the one around the corner (Λοστρέ κουζίνα - Polished Kitchen in English), had what was maybe the best Gyro platter I enjoyed in all of Greece.<br/>The host communicated quickly and well, and the apartment had everything we needed. I recommend it highly!"

But the piece de resistance is the terrace!! wow! It's huge, lies alongside the kitchen, bedroom and living room, with doors from each room to the balcony, and it's view is right on Acropolis! perfectly framed! and it's wide and comfy for many people! The location is rather quiet and only a few minutes from Plaka and the rest of downtown. We definitely recommend this apartment and would come again!"

Posizione con vista sull'acropoli è molto suggestiva e comoda.<br/>La casa ha tutto quel che serve per soggiorni di breve e lunga durata.<br/>Da preferire senza nulla togliere agli altri Host.
30461387,454827875173040691,2021-09-19,61823504,Irini,"Great stay,  very friendly host.  The balcony and it's view are amazing and the location of the apartment could not be better.  Just 10 min. walk  to Acropolis. Totally  recommended!"
30461387,456303702619536386,2021-09-21,184435965,Alexis,"We didn't have a very good stay overall. There were some good things but also some not so good things.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Great air conditioning - one unit in each bedroom and one in the living room made it easy to keep the rooms we were using cool without bothering with the rooms we weren't using.<br/>Check-in and luggage drop-off - Socrates let us drop of our luggage when we arrived early, and he gave us our keys at that time so we wouldn't have to hassle with planning a separate check-in time after he finished cleaning.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Wifi - the wifi was terrible, to the point that it was almost as if there wasn't wifi. The airbnb didn't even have its own wifi, just an extender for Socrates's wifi from the floor below. After we brought up the wifi issues, Socrates left a phone with a sim card for us to use as the wifi. This was better, but still not great overall.<br/>The shower - there was a detachable shower head but there was nothing to attach it to. There wasn't a hook or a mount on the wall to hang it up, which meant you could only use it by holding it up yourself.<br/>Hot water - after running the boiler for 20 minutes as instructed, we didn't have enough hot water for two showers (it ran out partway through the second shower). And on the next night, we ran the boiler multiple times and it still wouldn't heat the water. When we told Socrates, he came to look at it and said it had a connection and should be working so just try again.<br/><br/>Upon looking more closely at past reviews, it's clear that at least the wifi and shower head issues were both known and still had not been addressed despite past complaints. Overall, I wouldn't recommend the hassle of staying here if you need wifi or want a good hot shower."
30461387,460534968140152479,2021-09-27,327023630,Dmitry,"Socrates is kind and very friendly man. He even wrote down names of the cafes we would like to visit (and he was right about them, great places with delicious food). The apartment is very cozy and it has everything you need. There are beautiful pieces of art on walls, so many great pictures. Every room has its own balcony. The plants are all around, I loved that! And a view... Oh this view to Acropolis! It's a dream!"

30469111,458656825,2019-05-26,87069146,Robert,"We stayed in both apartments. They are stylishly designed and have a lot of cool features. Tons of books and pictures. The kitchens have everything the you need plus some basics like oil and some spices. The rooftop terrace was the highlight for our group. We enjoyed our time up there and even ordered from the restaurant downstairs. Which I recommend for their tasty food but also because they don't pester you like so many other restaurants in the touristy area of Athens. <br/><br/>There is a whole Mary Poppins area near the apartment, complete with umbrellas hanging so naturally there are always people snapping photos. It is also only a block or two from the flea market. Our group highly recommends starting your morning at, The Happy Blender for a juice or smoothie to help combat a late night out :)<br/><br/>The host gave great recommendations and even gives you a map with everything written down. I would recommend staying here to anyone visiting Athens."

A cool terrace and roof top, although a little noisy with the ventilation of the restaurant and the air conditioners next door, but great for morning coffee or evening beer. In short, a great family time. Thanks a lot Versaweiss,<br/>Marc"

I regret we did not have a chance to meet, however; If I visit Athens in the future I’m hoping to be able to book her place again!"

30489186,653071485,2020-08-18,69753277,Alexander,"A great little apartment in one of the most interesting parts of Athens. It's absolutely perfect as a jump-off for exploring Exarcheia, plus the close proximity to the Metro makes it easy to get around town.<br/>Smaragda was a great host who provided us with useful tips of the surrounding area.<br/>All-in-all, highly recommended."
30489186,713231699,2020-12-04,241902826,Lea,"Ich habe über einen längeren Zeitraum im Apartment von Smaragda gewohnt und kann es nur weiterempfehlen! Die Lage ist ideal, um auf den Lycabettus Hügel zu gelangen, bei der Acropolis ist man in 40min zu Fuß (wobei man auf diesem Weg in das „richtige“ Athen eintauchen kann). In direkter Nähe befinden sich einige Cafes und Restaurants, wobei es sich eher um eine ruhige Wohngegend handelt. Das Apartment ist ideal für Alleinreisende oder Paare, für eine dritte Person gibt es eine Ausklappcouch, aber es könnte eng werden. Das Badezimmer ist klein, aber mit einer geräumigen Dusche. Großer Pluspunkt sind die beiden kleinen Balkone, welche in den Innenhof gerichtet sind. Neben der Lage und Größe besticht das Apartment durch die umfassende Ausstattung: Küchenutensilien, Bettwäsche, Handtücher und wichtiger „Kleinkram“ (Schreibzeug, Ersatzlampen) sind vorhanden, um den Aufenthalt sehr angenehm zu gestalten. Die Waschmaschine funktioniert einwandfrei."
30489186,768239488,2021-06-09,225570632,Galini,"This place has literally everything you might need even for a longer visit! It has  a fully equipped bedroom, kitchen and bathroom.  Beautiful view from the balcony as well, with trees all around. Most of the day it’s really quite, though at night there is a loud buzzing noise, probably from the ventilation from the bar downstairs. In the area around you can find cafes, supermarkets etc. Only fault I found is that the floor was dirty, especially in the hall, where there were hair and oily sticky stains... But probably Smaragda just missed it, because everything else was clean. She was also a great host, checking whether I needed anything. I would easily suggest this place for a couple."
30489186,404066349315674623,2021-07-11,2900814,Tassos,"A great place in a central part of Athens, with full equipment and with a caring host. Recommended."

The flat is surrounded by beautiful cafes and restaurants, whilst sightseeing and shopping is literally just round the corner. Very clean and stylist, you can tell that some love has been put into this place! Very comfortable for three people although it has a sofa bed that can sleep two more people easily. Maria had left out ingredients for breakfasts from locally sourced suppliers which I found it to be a very sweet touch. I will be definitely staying at this flat again in the future and I can’t wait to visit again."

Around the flat you can find a number of restaurants, bars and cafè for all needs. John's flat is very bright and quiet in spite of being located at the very heart of Athens. John has been very helpful for all my needs, and made my stay there comfortable. I strongly recommend it. Being an Airbnb host myself in Northern Italy, I know how difficult is to fully meet all the requirements by visitors. John made it!"

Highly recommended."

However, what you cannot see in the pictures is the hospitality of Ioannis, who made our stay even more pleasant. He welcomed us with bottled water, a brochure full of good tips (pharmacy, supermarket, restaurants etc). He even left us coffee, sugar, milk and some jam and toast bread. <br/>The location of the apartment is great: literally just 2 minutes away from the Acropolis Museum and 5 minutes away from the Acropole entrance."

Located just south of the Acropolis, you are minutes from attractions, restaurants, public transit, shopping, etc. Here are some examples of how close you are:<br/><br/>Acropolis: 5 minute walk<br/>Acropolis Museum: 5 minute walk<br/>Metro station: 3 minute walk<br/>Temple of Zeus: 8 minute walk<br/>National Gardens: 15 minute walk<br/>Plaka: 9 minute walk <br/>Panathenaic Stadium: 15 minute walk<br/>Monastiraki Square: 16 minute walk<br/><br/>And if you don’t want to walk, the metro is 1,40€ for a 90 minute ticket, and you can get almost anywhere!<br/><br/>Not to mention how close you are to some amazing Greek food! Want some amazing Greek breakfast? Head 1 minute around the corner to 7 Cactus. Authentic Greek dinner? You are seconds away from Mani Mani, where you can get some of the best food in town. <br/><br/>Enough about location, let’s talk about Ioannis’s place. It has absolutely everything you need, and more. This specific unit is on the 1st floor (second floor for Americans) with a beautiful balcony view. You have a private entrance, and once inside you can take the spiral marble staircase up, or the elevator. You’ll be greeted with great natural light, new features, wood floors, and every amenity. Cozy kitchen with all appliances and utensils. A spacious modern style bathroom with soap, toiletries, and fresh towels. The bedroom has a very comfortable large bed, clothing storage, and balcony access. The living room has a pull out couch to accommodate more guests, a smart TV with many channels and Netflix access, as well as balcony access. <br/><br/>Ioannis was there well before I arrived and gave me a tour of the entire place. He even leaves you an informations packet with attractions, food, transit info, WiFi passwords, etc. He is always available to offer help and answer any questions. <br/><br/>This was the best AirBnb experience I have ever had. Ioannis is wonderful, and his place is incredible. I promise you will not be disappointed!"

He left us with local tips and basic necessities for the kitchen which is really very thoughtful. Also we did everything in that short span of time (especially covering the historic sights) by foot from his place.

The hosts are friendly and considerate, and the studio is very comfortable and equipped with everything you'll need. There's a desk in the room and a table on the balcony, so plenty of space for working. Location wise, it's within walking distance of the centre of Athens, and there are several local cafes and supermarkets nearby, as well as the Archaeological Museum, a park, and an excellent local bakery just across the road. Efharisto Anna and Aris!"

30497982,438697238,2019-04-17,3195073,Жанетта,"В целом пребывание понравилось. Апартаменты светлые, но очень маленькие, что стало несколько неожиданно. Особенно ванна, было очень тесно и прием душа не приносил удовольствия. От метро далеко, приходилось пользоваться автобусами. Но принимая во внимание бюджет, то все равноценно."
30497982,456996841,2019-05-23,4056079,Clare,"Anna was very helpful, answered all questions very quickly. There is an elevator (lift), which helped me a lot. The balcony was a treat and the closet and cabinet had enough space. I was not actually cooking, but there was some kitchen equipment, and Anna would probably find whatever else you need. Like other places I've stayed in Europe, the tub/shower is probably best for smaller people like me!"
30497982,457862133,2019-05-25,3506629,Supurna,"I had a lovely stay at Anna's place. It was a short stay but very comfortable. The apartment is small but fine for a couple or a single person with a nice bedroom with storage super comfortable bed and a balcony. Though I did not cook the kitchen is well equipped. This is a quiet street but close enough to the main road connecting this to Exarchia. Anna is super communicative, helpful and always with a ready smile. All in all great value for money!"

30497982,466292340,2019-06-09,253597081,Younes,A very nice and remarkably well equipped little studio in the heart of Athens. It is an hour away on foot from the Acropolis with decent transport links and proximity to supermarkets. Everything one needs to enjoy this lovely Mediterranean city.

30497982,519708683,2019-08-29,4261488,Hallie,Beautiful place to explore Athens.
30497982,523622325,2019-09-04,245352039,Steven,"Great place! shops are just down the road, town cost about 4 euro to centre and about a 40 min walk which didn’t seem that long when there’s so much going on. Place is tidy Anna greeted us early hours of the morning as our flight was early. Highly recommend."

30497982,588116812,2020-01-04,156891006,Wojciech,"We can easily recommend Anna’s apartment. All was as described and our Anna was waiting for us in. <br/>Location wasn’t perfect from our perspective because in this area streets and pavements are very narrow and buildings ground floor levels are vandalised by graffiti which creates apocalyptic atmosphere but we could judge it only after this trip.<br/>However we do recommend this place for future travellers because of what’s in below.<br/>Shops, bakery and all you might want was nearby. Very quiet neighbourhood and clean tenement. <br/>All the best,<br/>Ola and Wojtek"

30497982,408442193552664584,2021-07-17,4815894,Alex,"I stayed in this apartment for one month, and it was a good way to get to know the rhytms of life in a real Athenian neighborhood. The place was clean and well equipped. Anna the host was very responsive, and always thoughtful and kind.  There was a farmer's market on a Wednesday half a block away, and the produce was amazing. There are many options for groceries nearby. I highly recommend this place, but with a couple of caveats. In the summer months, it is hot, and there is no AC. If you can't stand the heat, caveat emptor. also, the place is quite small, and it is a bit cramped in some places. Getting into and out of the bathtub could present difficulties. Keep this in mind if you have arthritis, back problems, or issues with balance etc."
30497982,441036376726361351,2021-08-31,183643608,Emilie,"+<br/>Anna est une hôte bienveillante, donne de bonnes recommandations, et très réactive quand il y a le moindre problème.<br/>L'emplacement est calme et agréable pour se balader, il y a un arrêt de bus, un supermarché et plein de petits cafés et boulangeries.<br/>Le balcon est agréable, le voisinage est silencieux et les parties communes sont propres. <br/><br/>-<br/>Parfait pour un court séjour, pour un mois on peut manquer de place et d'équipements.<br/>Les équipements semblent plutôt vieux et dans leur jus. <br/>L'absence de clim en été peut-être embêtant.<br/>La salle de bain est étroite.<br/><br/>Nous recommandons l'appartement d'Anna pour un petit séjour tranquille "

30506741,558480395,2019-11-03,269059432,Maria,"Pros: very well located apartment, about 2-3 minutes on foot from subway station, friendly and helpful host who answers quickly. The region of the apartment is close to Athens city center and there are multiple transportation choices. Plenty of shops nearby. Urban and renowned region. <br/>Cons: the apartment is located on the ground floor of a block of flats, (mainly used as offices). It only has an old window(needs renovation) which faces the back side of the block, so it's a little bit dark. In the kitchen there are portable hot plates to cook. Since it's on the ground floor, I would prefer a newer door with a safety lock."

The location is spot on, right in the traditional region of Plakas in Athens. The house is lovely, very well catered and very clean and tidy! The host was also very helpful, even though we booked in the last minute, he was able to accommodate our stay, welcomed us in the house and was very kind to give us very thorough suggestions for our day trip in Athens. We will definitely try to book back to this place when we return to Athens!!"

Walking distance to great restaurants, shops, and historical points of interest make Panos’ place a perfect choice.  We loved the architectural detail in the home as well. Our favorite spot was the small outdoor porch off the kitchen. Morning coffee and a glass of wine in the evenings made this the best place in the house for us!  Great communication from a thoughtful host. Thank you!"

The location was exactly what we were looking for, on a pedestrian street in Plaka, with shops and restaurants nearby.  There are two bedrooms downstairs, a clothes washer, and a bathroom.  You access upstairs with a spiral staircase which opens into a large and open living room/kitchen with access to a small balcony.  There is a little office nook and my daughter loved the loft above the kitchen!<br/><br/>Athens was in the midst of a heatwave and are pleased to report the air conditioning system was outstanding!  <br/><br/>Panos was a wonderful and helpful host and we look forward to visiting again.<br/><br/>Note, there are a lot of steps involved walking up from the road and the place is on a pedestrian street.  Panos helped with our luggage and his taxi driver picked us up for our return to the airport."

30509294,514959712,2019-08-22,8171704,Kristian,"Truly outstanding experience at Panos’ place in Plaka, Athens. First, you’re staying in one of the best neighborhoods, right underneath the Acropolis. Tons of tavernas, shops, walking, hidden streets, the Old Athens, charm and eclectic magic. Second, Panos’ place is a little hidden gem. Stylish, modern, with charm and wonderful decor. A two story flat that simply wants you to make it home. Two fantastic bedrooms downstairs and a lovely living area and kitchen + office upstairs make for an unforgettable flat in the heart of Athens. Third and finally, Panos’ hospitality, the ease of getting to and from the airport, the lightning fast communication and general stellar service complete what was a tremendously great stay at his place. I look forward to staying here again and recommend Panos’ place to anyone looking for something delightful and basically perfect in the best part of Athens. Bravo."

The books and artwork, the vibe, the private balcony overlooking the small courtyard and the peaceful area (called Anafiotika) felt more like a village with its alleys, but close to the Acropolis and the Plaka. The apartment was clean and welcoming, with lots of maps and information, local and historical. Great nearby restaurants. We will definitely be back!"

30509294,533098734,2019-09-21,45208773,Angie,Panos was very accommodating. His house is in the heart of the plakas so it was very easy to get to all of the shops and restaurants. The house is also extremely close to the Parthenon and Acropolis Museum; very easy to walk to.

There are countless amazing shops and restaurants just steps away. The only drawback might be that you’ll have a tough time choosing where to go. But don’t worry - Panos will provide plenty of local tips to help you narrow down your decision. If and when I come back to Athens, I would stay here again in a heartbeat."

It made us really feel at a friend's home - a friend we know, like and share many things with (art, design, furniture...). It's been an incredible pleasure to stay there, and whenever we return to Athens - soon we hope - there's no other place where we'd like to stay ;-)"

30509294,613914293,2020-03-03,39059918,Keith,"Wonderful location!! A charming and unique house! Exactly what I wanted in an AirB&B! No hassle check-in and out. Very responsive host (especially when I locked myself out when I needed to go to the airport). Very clean an cozy. Minutes to the acropolis. The beds were comfortable enough, but not thick hotel type mattress. I would not say that’s it’s an acropolis view (and I don’t think it was advertised as such). You are so close that you are looking up at the wall, and it’s only visible from a small corner window. The church bells were a little loud Sunday morning, but it was also the beginning of lent and I was already awake anyway. There’s churches everywhere in Greece. So, I would expect this at many locations throughout Athens. The bathroom lights did not work, and there was a note that they would be fixed soon. I would not hesitate to stay here again, and would certainly recommend it."

It’s a well designed home that I dreamt of living in: spiral staircase, large windows, lots of natural light, tastefully designed. Panos was extremely attentive to our needs and always responsive to our inquiries. Great location, we loved being able to walk up to Acropolis in the small streets. The airport transport they arrange for you is worth it because you won’t have to worry about a thing. Highly recommend!"
30509294,758243566,2021-05-15,6106130,Helene,"We loved staying at the very artistic and affectionated house. It is absolutely quiet, perfect located in the middle of lovely resterants, nice shopping and a few minutes to the entrance of the acropolis. Mind to have luggage you can easely carry, for you have to climb up old narrow streets with steps as it is in an ancient part of a city."

For a short stay, though, people to tend to use more the ground floor with the two beds and the washroom. And here there are really 2 things to improve :<br/>- the heating floor of the washroom - this was a burning issue, so to speak, for the whole family, as the floor was really burning hot... due to a disfunction, not due to Athens’ heat.<br/>- the electricity  and light system is really difficult to understand and manipulate.<br/><br/>These  two things bothered us but did not spoil the trip of course, and the place can still be recommended for its charm and location."

Our host was super polite and helpful and very easy to communicate with. <br/><br/>Only reason I didn’t give a 5 star was due to the incredible amount of mosquitos in the apartment.

The apartment is basically brand new, with clean everything and kitchen essentials . The bathroom is bright and clean and the shower is hot and powerful. There are also snacks and coffee for you. And it’s basically right next to the heart of Athens - the acropolis and it’s museum. It’s also 2 min away from a metro station which makes it perfect for us who has a large luggage. There is a place right behind the apartment offers luggage storage 24/7 with a reasonable price, in case you need it after check out. <br/>The host Loannis is super easy to work with and he provided so much helpful tips.   The check in and out direction was easy and smooth. You can reach him anytime when you need to. <br/>Overall this is the place you want to book, personally I’d stay here again when I return to Athens without hesitation."

The street that the place is located on is very quiet and is off the main roads. Place was perfectly clean, had WiFi, great shower and fully stocked kitchen. Aircon was lifesaving when it’s +36 outside. Ioannis was a great host - always available to answer any questions we had, gave us a lot of information and clear instructions about the flat.

We were travelling with a baby and they provided a cot, baby blankets etc and there is a bathtub that makes bathtime super easy.  Location is fantastic for getting around to see the main sites, you can walk pretty much everywhere in under 30 minutes.  Also an elevator building!"

Incredible views of the Acropolis and Ancient Agora in the daytime and nighttime. Everywhere  was in close walking distance, didn't have to take a taxi to see any of the sights once. Great hosts who provided quick responses. Would highly recommend!"
30517143,423124656,2019-03-13,246392327,John,Great apartment in a great location to spend my last days of my vacation. Thanks for everything and definitely I will stay there on my future visits in Athens!
30517143,427254947,2019-03-23,110895109,Parker,The view from the room was absolutely amazing. However the host did not give us much information and the bathroom was pretty gross.
30517143,430316787,2019-03-30,188429476,Abida,"Exceptional service, exceptional home away from home, exceptional view, and exceptional location.<br/>Exceptional service — Fast response to my questions even before I booked and any questions I had regarding our stay. They also arranged for a very comfortable transfer to and from the airport. If you are 3 or more, I suggest you take the transfer rather than Metro.<br/><br/>Exceptional home— Clean, newly renovated apartment. <br/><br/>Exceptional View — You have a view of the Acropolis all day and all night. Just like the picture.<br/><br/>Exceptional location — Central location near metro, shops and restaurants. Walking distance to the restaurants. Check out the Kings Theater for great cocktails and tapas.<br/>Definitely book again."
30517143,432494353,2019-04-04,69033534,Ryan,"A wonderful, clean, well-located apartment with a killer view of the Acropolis. Lots of natural light, quiet, great WiFi, comfortable beds, good heating and air conditioning, good water pressure, and walking distance to anything you could want.  Pick up service from the airport was a nice touch, the elevator was a bonus, and the neighborhood was fun. Right across the street from the metro and walking distance to all main attractions."

30517143,460744857,2019-05-30,51957521,Steven,"The apartment was larger than expected and quite modern inside. Plenty of space to stretch out and host several people. The location is excellent, right in the middle of everything and the view of the Acropolis from the apartment is fantastic. The street the property is located on is interesting, which seemed to be a common theme in Athens."
30517143,461750196,2019-06-01,126955834,Jeannine,"Alex and Maria’s place is a perfect refugee from the hustle and bustle of the city!  It is perfectly located in a part of town that you could literally walk around for hours enjoying the shops and restaurants.  The views and pictures are just as described.  There was air conditioning in all 3 rooms which made it nice when you travel with people who prefer different cooling and heating temperatures for sleep.  There was a wonderful bottle of red wine and other goodies awaiting us when we arrived, which was nice after a long and tidies voyage across the ocean!  If you are looking for a space to spread out with wonderful views and safe neighborhood, I highly recommend this place."

We stayed here with a one year old and there was lots of space for him to run around, the flat provided were everything we needed and the air conditioning was a blessing when it was 35 degrees outside.  It’s in a busy area and you are very well connected to everything but there is no noise from the streets.<br/><br/>Communication and the help provided was great when I had difficulty getting in and had follow up questions during the stay."

On peut contempler l’Acropole assis sur son canapé !     L’emplacement est idéal, on est au cœur de tout ! Un petit bémol : la façade et la porte d’entrée sont entièrement taguées et la cage d’escalier est crade !"

30517143,525139830,2019-09-07,258607153,Laura,"Very close to Monastiraki Square.  So many places to eat and enjoy the Greek (Website hidden by Airbnb) GOOD!  Beautiful view of the Acropolis.  <br/>We didn't expect the Athens graffiti.  Being from the USA, we were quite surprised.  Due to all the graffiti it made it challenging to find the door to the flat entrance.   The lights didn't work in the stairwell for the first 2 flights of stairs.  Thankful for the elevator! The flat itself was BIG."
30517143,527162357,2019-09-10,5370447,Blanca,"The view is great but I would not recommend staying here unless you are ok with the following:<br/> <br/>-The airport pick-up and the view from the living room are the best part of this place. It is also easy to get to top Athens spots.  If you are looking for a low cost option for a group, this is a step up from a hostel. They offer wine and snacks upon arrival which is a nice touch and the locations is a great access to bars and going out things downstairs. <br/>-This rental appears to be managed by a company, so it is not an average personal Airbnb offering which comes with pros and cons. <br/>-The location is on top of a popular going out area, which is convenient to access bars and restaurants but the noise goes until ~12am-1am and then the power washers start cleaning ~7am in the morning. The noise was so loud, when I had evening work calls the people on my call commented on all of the background noise. <br/>-My flight plans changed and I offered advance notice that I would arrive 24 hrs later than expected due to flight changes.  I was offered no partial refund.  I understand the hassle of prepping a rental and it not being used but as a frequent traveler, I know travel issues occur and schedules change.  Almost every time I have had this happen in other locations, I have been offered a full or partial refund.<br/>-Renters are sent machine automated messages which can be very confusing when the messages conflicted with my travel plans. <br/>-The stairwell is dark going up the 4th floor is dark, so I suggest having your cell phone available to use the flashlight to navigate the front door and stairwell.  There is a light in the stairwell but the bulb is not working on all floors. <br/>-The alley where the front door is located is dark and smells. Even the locals commented on the odor of the alley.  The alley is popular as it is close to Little Kook, a popular place to take photos.  So I did not feel that unsafe as a single female traveler walking in a dark alley. <br/>-There are TONS of rentals in Athens and many of them are new, remodeled and with rooftop lounges and terraces in the same or better neighborhoods.  This listing was a little run down, pricier and not as nice as other places that I stayed. The hospitality was also the lowest of my entire Greece trip.  I recommend checking out (Website hidden by Airbnb) which had new places, in good neighborhoods with amazing hospitality. <br/><br/>I love AirBnb and am grateful to participate in this sharing platform as a guest and hostess. I usually don't offer such detailed feedback on places, but I wanted to share more color on the experience of renting this place, as it was different than expected."
30517143,553389464,2019-10-24,94356104,Jen,"An oasis in the middle of funky and gritty Psyrri. My mother and I loved this place; it was spacious and super comfortable. Lots of nice touches such as flowers, slippers, water in the fridge, and coffee for the maker. The photos are accurate although the two bedrooms are more roomy than they appear. We used the kitchen and dining room table for breakfast. The views of the Acropolis and the Temple of Hephaestus are incredible and can be viewed while relaxing in the nice couches. You are right in the middle of Psyrri and within walking distance of all the tourist sites.  Highly recommend. Two things to note: make sure you scroll through the multiple pages of the check-in instructions on your phone. (pretty obvious in retrospect but I missed it.) The building is located in a street covered with graffiti and the entryway is a bit off-putting with flickering lights and not very clean."

Great location a few minutes from the main square and metro in Monisteraki Sq. Stunning views of the Acropolis.  The apartment was well equipped and beds comfortable.  Bedrooms face the street but noise wasn't generally an issue. The terrace [which doesn't have THE view] gets sun first thing in the morning.

30517143,665251185,2020-09-18,57701129,Raphael,The flat is very well located and the view on the Acropolis is indeed breathtaking. The building and hallway may be a little rebutting at first but the flat is very nice and worth the stay. Equipments are good and the apartment is functional. Alex is an attentive and flexible host. I highly recommend.
30517143,667062427,2020-09-22,110453888,Rebecca,"Buyer beware. This apartment is located in a dump...trash on almost every floor, even a dirt mattress in the hallway. Apartment is nothing like the photos. One reviewer said the bathroom was gross. He was right. And the worst part of the experience in the end was the host. He was rude, arrogant and insulting. I arrived Sunday evening and was out of there the next day as soon as I could book a hotel. If you are in doubt, trust your instincts because you should have serious doubts about this place, the location, and the host doesn’t know what the word “host” means. He is the opposite of a super host. I didn’t even want to review this place because I just wanted to redeem the rest of my trip to Athens, but my family who live in Athens and the Greek manufacturer I have a business with said that it was better to warn people not to rent this place. You can find amazing views of the Acropolis all over Athens. Don’t let the photos fool you... that is unless you like garbage in the hallways of the building, a run down place with zero charm, and a host that likes to hear himself talk and to insult you in the process."

30517143,670778648,2020-10-04,37444024,Artemis,"Absentee owners renting out a great apartment in a filthy building. The lobby to this building is filthy. The surroundings of the of building are filthy. Yes, the apartment itself is nice and the acropolis view is great, but while you're looking at the acropolis, look directly down and you'll see TRASH in what was once a courtyard. There is a stink of urine outside the building. In the dark lobby, there is caked-on filth on the floor. The stairs from the lobby to the apartment are terrifying. The stairs and landings are littered with trash, furniture, empty food containers, caked over food spills. It looks like someone has been living in there. Also there are several doors with bars over them, abandoned units in the building that look like people have been squatting in them.  I complained about this to the owner on the first day, and they responded that they had in turn complained to the manager, who they claimed inhabited the unit with which this unit shares a wall. They blamed it on the manager, and we spent the entire week in a nice apartment that is surrounded by filth. They also blamed the cleaning company for not cleaning. They told us to take the elevator, which is also not clean, although usually not littered. One day someone poured a bottle of what smelled like bleach in it and left a soaking pile of paper towels on it. The owners said the trash was retribution by tenants that don't like airbnb. I don't believe that, this is OLD, OLD caked-on filthy floors and decaying trash. The owners said they can't come clean it themselves because of covid. I don't believe that. I spoke with an Athenian police officer that confirmed that covid restrictions do not stop people from cleaning their buildings. They said they've never had any tenants complain about the building before. So, I invite all future travelers to take a look the lobby, look at the stairs, and when you see a dumpster's worth of trash and dead cockroaches, please complain to the owners. I am Greek, I have been to Greece more times than I can count, and I know that this is not normal."

Very spacious and light. <br/>The beds could be more comfortable as not the best beds and mattresses. <br/>Main issue was the entrance to the building, lobby and lift are very dirty with rubbish around and not a nice look as you enter. The stairwell is even worse with other floors of the building looking horrible."

Restaurants, shops and grocery stores are super close, so you can get whatever you need.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the outside.  Like much of Athens, the entrance is covered in graffiti so it's hard to see at first.  But once you get inside, it's fine.  There is an elevator (thank goodness!) to bring your luggage up.  Also, you're literally at Little Kook's doorstep, so it constantly smells like sweets, which was a nice touch.<br/><br/>The apartment is as it looks in the pictures and was very clean.  Honestly, it as everything you need as far as kitchen/relaxing goes.  There is a great view of the acropolis (though the window does need to be cleaned) and the patio was something that my sister and I took advantage of several times to just sit outside, relax and enjoy the sounds of people having fun and the music.<br/><br/>Definitely worth the money you pay to stay here and I would happily recommend it to others as well as stay there again myself."

A supermarket, a bakery, and a bus stop are less than 2 minutes away and there are numerous shops (pharmacy/hairdresser, etc.) within walking distance. It really feels home and the functional /clean kitchen can inspire someone to prepare a simple meal. The internet connection was a little bit of an issue for me but Anna was very helpful and communicated well! Also, the hairdryer was missing but this was not a big issue during the summer. I recommend this place!"
30518985,396817182558657805,2021-07-01,68846885,Chris,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Anna’s place for a month. Anna is incredibly helpful and communicative. The one time l locked myself out of the apartment she was right there to let me back inside in a very short time. Location is great—though a tad far from metro (15-20 minute walk), you get used to it—but the neighborhood has everything nearby (supermarket right around the corner, great bakery, etc) and it is relatively quiet at night (especially for a city). The place is really clean and nicely arranged.<br/><br/>The one negative is that the wifi is not the fastest and the range is limited (doesn’t reach the bedroom most of the time) since the router isn’t located in the apartment itself. <br/><br/>But if top-tier wifi isn’t a priority, it is an amazing place to have as home base in Athens, walkable within a half hour to many areas. Would recommend and stay again anytime I’m back in Athens!"
30518985,445356957276448478,2021-09-06,376107785,Caroline,"Super host who was very helpful to us, accurate description and good value for money for longer stays. Recommended. Thank you!"
30519522,364689939,2018-12-31,92699120,Michael,"Great place to stay with great location and great host! would definitely recommend! Wifi isn't the best, but many cafes with unlimited wifi at disposal."
30519522,406042963,2019-01-28,13789849,Alison,This flat is a great find. The location is within 5 minutes walking distance of the Acropolis Museum. The neighborhood is great; it is residential so you feel like you are really seeing Athens but also close to fantastic local cafes/bars/restaurants.<br/><br/>The flat is beautiful and well-maintained. It is a rental flat so does not have a lived-in feel but it is super stylish and feels brand new. We would definitely recommend staying here!
30519522,464675618,2019-06-06,161393751,Mehmet,"Excellent apartment located minutes away from excellent shops and restaurants. King has been a lovely host, solving any issues in minutes. Thank you for all your help. Definitely will stay here again when we are back in Athens."

30519522,479629104,2019-07-01,130164490,Tim,"Cannot recommend highly enough.  Just as promised - spacious, comfortable, fully equipped.  And the location was perfect with everything from great little neighborhood restaurants to food shopping to major tourist attractions all within walking distance.  We were on two-week tour and was great to start and end it at Myvacation’s apartment.  It is my new home for whenever I am next in Athens."
30519522,482156485,2019-07-06,178656238,Bisa,Foi uma experiência gratificante. O apartamento é super bem localizado e ótimo internamente. Superou minhas expectativas. Altamente recomendo!

30519522,490806013,2019-07-19,84974694,Lucas,"The place was absolutely beautiful and very spacious! Located very close to the Acropolis, it was perfect for a short trip to Athens for 5 people.<br/><br/>All of the essentials were there, however some of the day to day amenities were not provided (salt and pepper, toaster, large cutting knifes). <br/><br/>Also something to note is that the sofa is large and quite comfortable for one person, but does not transform into a bed.<br/><br/>We were very happy with our stay!"
30519522,494917187,2019-07-25,252927459,Paul,It was a great stay in Athens. The place was close to main tourist attractions and a lot of great local restaurants. Definitely would book it again if back in Athens.

Koukaki has a nice vibe with restaurants, groceries, and metro all within close proximity, as well as a 10 minute walk to the Acropolis."
30519522,504740373,2019-08-08,19071068,Jodi,"Fantastic location within walking distance to all the great Athenian sites! The apartment was clean, spacious, and stylish. We stayed with another couple and the 2 bed, 1.5 bath layout was perfect! If we had questions, the response was quick and helpful. We'd recommend it to anyone visiting and looking for a great place to stay."
30519522,509780313,2019-08-15,254291713,Sarfaraz,"It was the best apartment we ever had at Airbnb. We immediately felt at home. The interior is new and stylish. A designer with taste must have designed the interior. The kitchen, living room and the two bedrooms, which are air-conditioned, were impeccable, clean and spacious. The metro and all shopping facilities are close by. Another plus was the quick communication when questions arose. Everything was excellent!"
30519522,519756746,2019-08-29,53315831,Susana,The apartment is ver clean and comfortable.  A home away from home.

It’s really close to most of the important / worth visiting tourist sites, specially the Acropolis. There are many restaurants, cafes and convenience stores around, so no need to go far looking for food or drinks I recommend and would stay again. Thank you for making our time in Athens so enjoyable!"

Very good location, just 30 min walk to the city center or 10 min by taxi. The only thing the area might be busy with the car noise during the night. The apartment itself is just like on the photos. Highly recommended."
30519522,711221571,2020-11-25,91560856,Lorenzo,"Spacious apartment, unfortunately during our stay a lockdown commenced so no comments regarding the neighborhood but the apartment itself was comfortable enough to stay inside for an extended time with all the amenities you need."

The apartment would be excellent for four people or a family. It was very clean and provided all necessary amenities for a short or even a longer stay. The owner responded quickly and the check-in/out process was straightforward. I would visit again!"

30519522,765300591,2021-06-01,50927938,Aisling,"Beautiful apartment, spotlessly clean on arrival, spacious and very comfy beds! Tastefully decorated and a great location in the center of Kouaki - you feel right in the middle of things but generally, it's not too noisy. Bedrooms are wonderfully cosy with large balconies. A handy storage / utility room is available for luggage. The perfect place to spend some time in Athens and it's especially great for long stays - you feel right at home immediately.<br/><br/>The wifi can sometimes be a little slow for working is the only downside, but this is something that I'm sure can and will be fixed!<br/><br/>Thank you MyVacations for being great hosts and accommodating our needs. I will be staying here again <3"
30519522,768517943,2021-06-10,5076468,Jeffrey,I enjoyed my stay at the apartment. It was very clean and the accommodations were better than I expected. The neighborhood is very walkable and has many restaurants and cool sites.

Some issues with cleanliness when we arrived but MyVacations apologised and offered the cleaner to come back. Normally their properties are very clean so I believe this was just an anomaly. The rooms are spacious and bright and you feel in the middle of Kouakaki yet it's not too loud :) Thank you MyVacations!

El apartamento es muy espacioso y  decorado con gusto. Sin embargo, nos encontramos con una cama rota, la terraza no estaba limpia y, en nuestra opinión, debería contar con más útiles de cocina."

30521464,359113380,2018-12-16,198437590,Anastasia,Πραγματικά εξαιρετική τοποθεσία και υπέροχο σπίτι. Ο Βασίλης ήταν ένας πολύ καλός οικοδεσπότης και μας βοήθησε πολύ σε ότι απορίες είχαμε.
30521464,368536363,2019-01-07,160742222,Γιάννης,"Το σπίτι δεν ικανοποίησε επαρκώς τις προσδοκίες μας.Τα θετικά σημεία του σπιτιού είναι η τοποθεσία , το γεγονός ότι αισθάνεσαι ασφάλεια με την μόνιμη φύλαξη της γειτονιάς από την αστυνομία και φυσικά το ότι διαθέτει χώρο (Website hidden by Airbnb) σπίτι διαθέτει μια όμορφη αισθητική αλλά χρήζει βελτιώσεων.Στα αρνητικά του θα ήθελα να αναφέρω ότι δυστυχώς  καθόλη την διαμονή μας κρυωναμε αρκετά καθώς τα μέσα που υπήρχαν δεν επαρκούσαν για την θέρμανση του χώρου ενώ το ένα υπνοδωμάτιο ήταν παροπλισμένο καθώς εκεί δεν δούλευε καθόλου η θέρμανση κ αναγκαστικά κοιμομασταν όλοι μαζί με το παιδί μας σε ένα κρεβάτι. Επίσης στο μπάνιο υπάρχει μια τρύπα στον τοίχο προφανώς για λόγους εξαερισμού που όμως έμπαινε τρομερό κρύο και εκεί δεν υπήρχε καθόλου θέρμανση.Επισης είχε μια δυσωδία από τις σωληνώσεις κάποιες μέρες.Επιπλεον διέθετε μια τηλεόραση η οποία έπιανε μόλις δύο κανάλια με μια εσωτερική κεραία."

Walking distance proximity to attractions, shopping, markets! The street is 100% secure and is a gated community with 24 hour police protection which was great for parking our car!

We loved being able to make breakfast at home before starting our day, and had drinks on the patio one evening and coffee in the morning. The location was perfect for exploring Athens and having a good meal, catching the train to Airport or port, and there is an excavation site right down the street.  Vasili i responded promptly to our communication and every thing functioned as advertised. Would definitely stay here if returning to Athens."

30521464,513797315,2019-08-20,54768539,Lapo,"Casa ben posizionata e di valore, comodissima per visitare il centro storico. Peccato che il sistema di self check-in pensato, dia la possibilità di sbagliare agli ospiti. Al nostro arrivo l'appartamento era occupato da un ospite che aveva erroneamente confuso la chiave verde acqua con quella celeste. Vasilis ha mandato suo padre a rimuovere gli oggetti e portarci lenzuola e prodotti per la pulizia. In definitiva abbiamo rassettato le stanze e pulito il bagno autonomamente. Come se non bastasse la bellissima terrazza era completamente piena di escrementi di piccione. Peccato, sarebbe una casa fantastica."

30521464,515610138,2019-08-23,21593999,Ryan,"Great value for the location! The host made sure checkin was easy and we had everything we needed. The apartment was clean, large, and charming."

30521464,523231297,2019-09-03,27441006,Krystyna,"The location of this place is wonderful- a great fun area that is central and close to transport. <br/>The apartment is unique and has lots of character, especially the balcony.  There were only two downsides- the sheets on the second bed were very worn and mismatched. <br/>We had some trouble with the hot water and only got it working once during our stay. While the host was quite quick to respond to messages and always friendly, the explanations came in drips- it would have been better to get a full explanation at the beginning on how to work the hot water. <br/>Overall It was a good place to stay."
30521464,524093373,2019-09-05,14965845,Vincent,"Beautiful cozy place, and has the rustic decor.  Nice location.  I did not have an opportunity to see the host, and there was not any housekeeping service for multiple nights stay, but the site is excellent nice quaint feel.  Be ready to lug your stuff up some stairs if it is the second-floor apartment."
30521464,525082638,2019-09-07,7083553,Shannon,"Great value and location. However, check-in needs improvement. There is 1 lockbox outside with keys to all 3 units in the townhouse. Each key inside has the unit number on it, but the unit number was not provided in listing/communications."
30521464,526701481,2019-09-09,100829401,John,"The apartment is located on a private  street yet close to restaurants, shopping and many points of interest"
30521464,527103666,2019-09-10,18834729,Ross,"The apartment is exactly where you want to be in Athens, very protected parking and easy access. A definite choice if you can get it! You can even see the Acropolis from the awesome outer deck! (Hidden by Airbnb) maps gave us slightly wrong directions, if you are looking at the corner and thinking “where is this apartment” look right and pull up to the gate."

30521464,534832429,2019-09-23,153614781,Jen,"We enjoyed our stay, this is very close to many restaurants and historical sites. Be sure to park where instructed by the host (there is parking provided). We couldn’t remember the parking details as we were traveling with no cell service, but we found a street spot one street over.. and our car was broken into overnight. Thank goodness for insurance, but you can avoid this by parking where the host provides."
30521464,536737700,2019-09-27,78046793,Bea,"Beautiful flat in a perfect location. Really great balcony with views of the Acropolis and walking distance to all the sights, bars and restaurants"

Although, we were unable to solve a parking problem. I wish owner would of told us that parking (asked for in advance) was not available during our stay.... Or at least apologize for miscommunication. Especially because I booked it the same day as stay and owner was aware of the issue."
30521464,539322821,2019-10-01,5512337,Aubin,"The apartment is really orignial and charming, located in an authentic area close from public transports.<br/>I would totally stay another time at this place."
30521464,544026959,2019-10-09,46274603,Anne,Lovely apartment in a very convenient location with great neighborhood restaurants and a beautiful walk to the acropolis.  Note that Athens has a vibrant night life so I suggest you bring ear plugs if you're a light sleeper.

Ответил на все наши вопросы и помог нам заселиться в квартиру немного раньше означенного срока. <br/><br/>Недостаток один - санузел.<br/>Головку душа не на что закрепить. <br/>Слив душа расположен в полу дверного проёма душевой кабинки. В него ничего не сливается. Вода выливается прямо на пол туалета и там остаётся.

It was very clean at our arrival and big enough for at least4 people. The house is 4 mn walking from the metro and that is great to visit Athens !<br/>It's 20 mn away (direct lune) to Piraus the biggest ferries port of Athens!<br/>The acropolis is accessible on foot and there is very good restaurant in Monastiraki !

Ο οικοδεσπότης έχει κάνει πολύ προσεγμένη δουλειά για να  σε μεταφέρει σε ένα σπίτι της παλιάς Αθήνας με όλες τις ανέσεις της σύγχρονης κατοικίας. Ολο το διαμέρισμα ήταν πεντακάθαρο, οι χώροι άνετοι, προσεγμένοι, διακοσμημένοι με γούστο και η κουζίνα διέθετε επαρκή εξοπλισμό. Αξίζει τα χρήματά του με το παραπάνω ! Το συνιστούμε ανεπιφύλακτα.

It was homey and beautiful all at the same time. Vasilis was a pleasure to talk to and great at communicating quickly. Also that view of the acropolis!!! Gorgeous!!!!

30521464,451904033387382891,2021-09-15,22435495,Hélène,"Un appartement de charme, atypique, spacieux, confortable et ""à l'ancienne"" (plafonds hauts, robinetterie style années 30, lustres et lampes, etc. Une  grande terrasse ombragée de verdure pour prendre l'apéritif en contemplant l'Acropole ou pour dîner. Très confortable literie (et lits de 180cm de large) dans chacune des deux chambres, qui peuvent communiquer si on le souhaite. Excellente douche (pression au top !) et climatisation indépendante dans chaque chambre et dans le sejour/cuisine. <br/>Belle maison ancienne dans une jolie ruelle, juste en face de la Synagogue principale d'Athènes. Et... l'extraordinaire cinéma en plein air des années 30 de Thission à1/4 d'heure à pied... Tous les sites archéologiques et quartiers intéressants de la ville sont accessibles à pied.<br/>Un seul minime point faible : malgré le calme de la rue, piétonne pour l'essentiel, on entend beaucoup, tôt le matin et tard le soir, le bruit des vélomoteurs, voitures, etc des rues et artères avoisinantes. Protections auditives indispensables (et suffisantes) si l'on a le sommeil léger.<br/>Magnifique séjour un grand merci à Vassili (et à Marie Ange qui nous a accueillis). Nous reviendrons certainement !"

It's super close to the tourist hotspots yet on a quiet secluded street. amazing floors and bathroom and private terrace and such a luxury to have air conditioning too. we had a great time and hope we can stay longer soon. Thanks so much for having us Vasilis :)
30521464,458458614308377966,2021-09-24,11544339,Marie-Anne,Nice old but charming apartment. Ideally located with a view of the acropolis.<br/>The flat is well furnished and the host was very friendly and reactive. We enjoyed our stay!
30521464,459915218570697592,2021-09-26,21520112,Lotte,"What we loved:<br/>- the area is absolutely perfect: nice restaurants, bars, walking paths, 15 minutes walk to Akropolis.<br/>- the street: secured 24/7 by police due to the synagoge = free and secured parking for your car, and you always feel safe.<br/>- the decoration: old historic building with beautiful furniture<br/>- the bathroom: i particularly enjoyed the shower<br/>- the rooftop terrace with amazing Akropolis view<br/><br/>What could’ve been better:<br/>- the appartment is clean in general, but pretty dusty in corners/on furniture<br/>- we had bad luck with the fridge not functioning and Vasilis could not reach a mechanic during the weekends. We therefore could not keep any food or drinks fresh, and had just bread and dips for dinner instead (not possible to eat out with the baby). In general the kitchen is very old and basic, so just enjoy the restaurants around instead of cooking, if you come here!<br/>- on weekend nights the street below the terrace is very busy and traffic is very noisy. We therefore did not enjoy sitting on the terrace as much as we would’ve liked.<br/><br/>Please note we were traveling with a one year old baby, so most of these points would not have disturbed us if we were only adults and I would absolutely recommend staying here if you don’t have kids with you :)"

30558144,363211728,2018-12-28,145520180,Pantelis,"Πρόκειται για ένα μεγάλο, άνετο διαμέρισμα για 4-6 επισκέπτες. Η τοποθεσία του στο Κολωνάκι είναι καταπληκτική (ήταν το κύριο κριτήριο επιλογής μας), γιατί μπορείς να πας οπουδήποτε, ενώ είναι απολύτως ήσυχο. Μόνο πρόβλημα το παρκάρισμα στο δημόσιο δρόμο, όπου είναι πολύ δύσκολο έως αδύνατο, αλλά υπάρχει ιδιωτικό πάρκινγκ στα 20 μέτρα, με χρέωση, εάν έχετε δικό σας αυτοκίνητο. Το διαμέρισμα είναι προσφάτως ανακαινισμένο, ενώ ήμασταν οι πρώτοι που μπήκαμε μετά την ανακαίνιση. Είναι μεγάλο, με πρακτική διαρρύθμιση και μία υπέροχη αυλή στο πίσω μέρος, ιδανική για το καλοκαίρι (το διαμέρισμα είναι ημιυπόγειο). Η διακόσμηση είναι ανάλαφρη, μεταδίδοντας θετική ενέργεια. Τα στρώματα πολύ άνετα και τα κλινοσκεπάσματα μύριζαν καθαριότητα. Υπάρχει και τηλέφωνο! Ο εξοπλισμός ήταν παραπάνω από πλήρης: η κουζίνα είχε κυριολεκτικά τα πάντα, για μαγείρεμα και παρασκευή καφέ (βραστήρας, καφετιέρα φίλτρου, espresso, κλπ), όλα τα σκεύη, ενώ υπήρχαν και βασικά υλικά, όπως καφές, ζάχαρη, νερό, γάλα, τσάι, χαμόμηλο, αλάτι, πιπέρι, λάδι, ξύδι, μέλι, κλπ. Υπήρχαν επίσης όλα τα υλικά καθαριότητας. Στο μπάνιο υπήρχαν όλα τα απαιτούμενα: αφρόλουτρο, σαμπουάν, σαπούνια, κιτ πρώτων βοηθειών, πιστολάκι μαλλιών, μπατονέττες, απλώστρα, μανταλάκια κλπ, ενώ η ντουζέρια ήταν πολύ λειτουργική. Υπάρχει ηλεκτρικός θερμοσίφωνας που ζεσταίνει το νερό σε 20-30 λεπτά. Για την καθαριότητα δεν υπάρχει κανένα παράπονο, το διαμέρισμα παραδόθηκε πάρα πολύ καθαρό, μυρίζοντας καθαριότητα. Να σημειωθεί ότι η επικοινωνία με τον ιδιοκτήτη ήταν άμεση, γρήγορη, ενώ ο ίδιος ήταν πολύ φιλικός και εξυπηρετικός. Είναι πολύ σημαντικό ότι υπήρχε μεγάλη ευελιξία στην ώρα check-in & check-out, ενώ το διαμέρισμα μας παραδόθηκε αυτοπροσώπως από τον ίδιο και το παραδώσαμε στον ίδιο, γεγονός σημαντικό για μας. Η εμπειρία της φιλοξενίας και διαμονής μας ξεπέρασε τις προσδοκίες μας και σίγουρα θα το προτιμήσουμε και σε ενδεχόμενη μελλοντική επίσκεψή μας στην Αθήνα."

30558144,434608325,2019-04-08,103492869,Rebecca Aislinn,"This place is spacious, in a good location, clean, and well enough equipped with amenities. The location is an easy walk from Syntagma square and the main shopping strip, we never used public transportation for anything. The house  has great amenities, including the washer an over, full sized fridge and heaters/AC in both bedrooms. The patio out back is nice, but because it rained a couple days we didn't get to utilize it much, when it wasn't raining we did use it. The place is updated nicely in the kitchen and bathroom, and has it's original charm in the flooring and classic furniture. The kitchen has what is needed for basic cooking, but not enough to do a full course meal or bake something in the oven- it worked just fine for us to make 1 simple dinner and breakfast everyday. The host and his assistant were really helpful, but you have to be able to contact them upon arrival so they can check you in personally. This may be difficult if you don't have an international data plan, but we used wifi at the airport and let them know when we were getting on the airport bus to the flat and it worked out perfectly. Really a great stay I would stay here again or recommend it to anyone."

He has also been very flexible with the checkout time even when  we changed it last minute. We can recommend the flat for everyone who wants to spend some days in central Athens.
30558144,478528710,2019-06-30,68715554,George,"This is a modern, clean and centrally located apartment in Athens, which includes everything required to have a comfortable stay.

30558144,495601514,2019-07-26,99991869,Rosalia,"This apartment was one of the best we stayed!  Manuel thought of all the details so we could feel at home.  It is complete!  It is very well located 10 minutes walking from Syntagma where buses leave for the airport at all times for 6 euros.  It is 1 block from the subway to the Acropolis in 10 minutes.  very close to Plaka where it has many good restaurants and gift shops.  To go by taxi to the National Museum will be only 4 euros and will take 10 minutes depending on traffic.  The place is very safe, beautiful and clean.  To access the apartment we have to go down some stairs.  Athenas was very hot, however the apartment has a very nice temperature so it was not necessary to turn on the air conditioner.  We recommend 100%.  Perfect and excellent value for money."
30558144,504804033,2019-08-08,363655,Antonia,The location of the apartment is very good.  The apartment was very clean and all the amenities functional.  Just bear in mind that as it is an underground apartment you will need to have the air conditioners on all the time while you are in the flat.

De andere is van prima formaat. <br/>Het is een appartement in het souterrain. Dat betekent weinig daglicht,maar in de zomer tegelijkertijd daardoor lekker koel.<br/><br/>Er is een soort patio waar je eventueel wel buiten kan zitten (rookplek).<br/>Het appartement ligt in een veilige buurt.  Supermarkt 1 straat verderop en 3 metrostations nabij Syntagmaplein is kleine 10 minuten lopen.<br/>Manuel is een fantastische host. Met goede tips en adviezen. Niets is hem teveel.<br/><br/>Een aanrader"
30558144,556286659,2019-10-29,2458420,Klea,Amazing cozy place at a great location! Syntagma and Ermou street ( shopping area) was about 10 minutes walk and Kolonaki night life was very close as well. Comfortable beds and a small yard with a table and chairs outside. Also we had an espresso machine with coffee capsules which was exactly what we needed before we start our day. Manuel gave us all the information for close by places like minimarkets and coffee shops. <br/>Thank you Manuel for the lovely stay!!

However it’s situated in half-basement, if you are sensitive with musty smell it’s quite annoying."

30558144,657613612,2020-08-29,47813405,Stephanos,"Host - Phenomenal <br/>Cleanliness - 10/10<br/>Hot water - 10/10 ( You'll have to open the switch, but there's no need to do it more than 10 minutes before hand its works instantly)<br/>Aircondition - Works Properly<br/>Beds - You wont be throwing any silent king-kong battles on them, but you can surely throw a mini boxing fight without your roommate taking a hint. ( Pro tip: the sliding doors connecting one of the beds to the living room dont lock, so make sure to pick the room that locks in case you're up for a brawl). <br/>Kitchen - Everything you can think of, even a nespresso machine. The refillable water jugs in the fridge are a big plus for hot summer days.<br/>Location - City centre / sintagma is in 8 minute walking distance, and the metro station is so close you can crawl to it. <br/>Bonuses: The flat has everything one would need to actually live there. So for anyone staying more than a week, things like washing machine, a place to hang clothes and iron them and all that jazz will be extra helpful."

The location was walking distance to everything, which made it convenient for us to come back in the heat of the day to rest. We were there during the heat wave of August 2021, and the apartment stayed cool without the A/C (which worked beautifully). There were five of us including my 2 kids and the space worked really well for us. <br/><br/>Manuel is also a incredible host.

The place is huge and could function as 4 bedrooms, if the guests prefer to spread out and sleep on the two sofas in the separate entry and living rooms. The patio looked fine but I was swarmed by mosquitoes the second I went out the door. Overall it was a great deal and a place I would consider staying again.<br/><br/>Only issue I'd note for those with fragrance or mold sensitivities, there is mold (typical of a basement) and fragrance diffusers attempting to mask the smell. Luckily I didn't need to use the A/C since it was dirty and congested my nose when I turned it on."

I enjoyed shopping at local boutiques and dining at the local restaurants. Very safe area and corner deli was perfect. Having a glass of retsina on the outside terrace made us feel like a local, not a tourist! Easy checkin and clear directions. Walking distance from metro."
30580730,473737433,2019-06-22,79552011,Patricia,"So my boyfriend and I traveled To Athens to have dental implant surgery (for myself. ) I knew I had to be there a month. I decided to book one place for the first part of the trip and then another place for the last two weeks. The first place in Kolonaki was GREAT . FRESH, modern in a great location! ( see my review!!) The actual surgery was not booked coming in to Athens as we had A few other things to do before hand… Once we finish those things in the first week then he scheduled the surgery… It just happened that it was also going to be on the day that we were supposed to be moving into Tegea’s place. It wasn’t ideal but it was the way it was. The self check in was the highlight . It was the ONLY thing without a problem. We got in ok no problems. And that’s where the “ good” ended. I was on meds and needed to stay still, icing my face for a couple days doctors Orders..The place did not smell clean. Parts did not look clean. As soon as I layed on the couch to ice my face I felt something on my arms and there were two ants crawling on me. We located many on the floor and coming in behind in behind uncaulked back of kitchen sink. So it was gross . But along with having to run right out to the closest store and buy toilet paper we just picked up some bug spray… Wasn’t happy but it wasn’t the end of the world. Once we each took Showers we noticed mold… Very easily cleaned with some bleach cleaner… Which next trip to the store we purchased. And to me one of the worse things was the towels and bedding. The towels ( one for each of us) were HARD AND CRUNCHY. And the bedding smelled unwashed and like “ dirty head” it was really bad. Even though I was not completely well on the second day we walked down to Ermou st and Went to H&M home and purchased a new duvet with pillowcases and a flat sheet.. by night of day two we realized we couldn’t stay . Noticing 1/2 The lightbulbs in the house were either missing or not working… Plaster was peeling and a light fixture in the hallway was hanging by a wire ( boyfriend is an electrical engineer and said this was dangerous!) THIS PLACE IS NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM REMODELED!! It looks like maybe the bathroom was done probably within five years ago but that is it. The patio that is played up so much in the description had an old card table /2 chairs with a plastic tablecloth… And nothing else. And the WiFi was dial up. Worked off and on. Never a good connection. It wasn’t just one thing it was the combination of many things… And although I told them about the ants and they offered to come over and take care of the problem… It was just I knew that we could solve that problem on our own just as well as them so I declined… I had just had surgery and was exhausted and I wasn’t in the mood to have a bunch of people around trying to fix a problem that they probably couldn’t fix anymore than we could… As far as the other things go at that point I didn’t trust them anymore. Anyone who Rents out a place that is OK maybe to the eye but very much UNCLEAN. The pillows after I took their pillow cases off. Were HEAVILY STAINED. ( when I sent them pictures of the pillows they basically tried to say they weren’t their pillows. Or that these were pillows I BROUGHT? I’m not sure exactly what they were trying to say. But they were not taking responsibility!! We both figured with the money that they get from renting and just one trip to IKEA… Less than €200 for some new bedding… Towels… Toilet paper… lightbulbs ..A couple of lounge chairs for outside… Caulk for behind the sink to keep the ants out. Paying someone TO ACTUALLY CLEAN. We are so lucky that we are in a position in life to quickly find another place a few blocks away. (A DECENT place in HIGH season That was available for another two weeks… ) And we were able to leave after our third night… Once we got moved to our new place I let them know that we had left and the reasons why.Of course it all was denied… I don’t like how I was treated.AND WHY Would we want to pay hundreds more dollars in the middle of our trip… Have to pack everything up and move everything again?? WHY WOULD WE DO THAT?? The case was finally settled with Airbnb yesterday and I won my case with pictures and receipts. I HOPE these hosts realize that there is something for everybody… Not a big deal if they want to leave that place “as is“ there’s always going to be people that will rent it no matter what… But you better bring that price down to $25… The place we rented before and the place we rented after were in similar area ( Well in Kolonaki anyways) .And Of similar price and we had absolutely no problems with either one of those! Only the best things to say about those 2 flats!! The cleanliness… And professionalism of the hosts!! And as long as I’ve come this far... although this does say KOLONAKI It is way on the end of KOLONAKI. Not the best part to be honest with you… Just going four or five or six blocks in the other direction towards square and you’re into a really really nice area. It WAS a 6 minute walk to ERMOU street.

The apartment was clean very clean. The place Kolonaki is one of the best quality places of Athens and during the night was very quite, and also very near from the center.

If you want to do some shopping at some of Athens best shops, then you are in no better location. All of the main attractions in Athens are not far away at all which was great.<br/>Everyone has different perspectives on things. There are some items within the apartment which require attention, however, they were not show stoppers for me. But some well placed repairs, cleaning and additional supplies would take this place to the next level.<br/>Tegea are responsive which was really appreciated, however, they are not hands on managers who will generally meet and greet you, etc. when you arrive if people are looking for that personal face to face contact and support.<br/>Overall I loved my stay and I was pleased with choice of accommodation."

Dîner avec l’acropole d’un côté et Lycabette Hill de l’autre.

She met us at the place and was helpful, welcoming and informative.  The places was prepared with everything you need and Nadia had every detail thought of (wine, beach blankets, snacks, coffee, recommendations, etc.).  The location was great in the heart of Kypseli and Nadia was easy to reach during our stay.   She was clearly proud of her place and neighborhood.  Apartment was airy and bright with nice balconies and ample space.  Would stay again!  Wish I was there now."

It is located in a vibrant neighbourhood, with lots of restaurants and bars in the vicinity. The acropolis is easily reached by bus or the very cheap taxi's. Nadia is the perfect host, she made us feel very welcome with a bottle of wine and some sweets we enjoyed on the balcony and gave us directions for the public transport and some nice restaurants in the neighbourhood. I highly recommend staying here."

Τα λόγια περιττά. Η κυρία Νάντια ένας γλυκός, ζεστός, με χρυσή καρδιά άνθρωπος που μας βοήθησε από την πρώτη στιγμή. Υπέροχη υποδοχή, γεμάτη αγάπη και ενδιαφέρον! Οτιδήποτε θελήσαμε η κυρία Νάντια ήταν πάντα εκεί από το να μας φέρει ότι χρειαζόμασταν μέχρι και μπλέντερ φρούτων που ήταν απαραίτητο κομμάτι της ανάρρωσης μου. Το σπίτι ήταν ότι πιο λεπτομερειακά άρτιο έχω αντικρήσει ποτέ μου ομολογώ. Κάθε τι ήταν μοναδικό αλλά ταυτόχρονα ταίριαζε μεταξύ του! Από τα έπιπλα, τις κουρτίνες, τα χρώματα μέχρι και διάφορα βιβλία, και αξεσουάρ που το έκαναν πολύ ιδιαίτερο. Εάν αν κάποιος σκοπεύει να ταξιδέψει στην Αθήνα είτε για ένα ταξίδι αναψυχής, είτε για διακοπές, είτε για κάποιο άλλο λόγο, του το συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα χωρίς δεύτερη σκέψη! Μια εξαιρετική επιλογή, σε σε καλή τιμή και καλό μέρος για την περιοχή, που είμαι σίγουρη ότι θα σας κερδίσει!"

30587235,469824949,2019-06-15,104204543,Rox,"We had a wonderful staying at the studio.<br/>The place is about 10-15 min walking distance from Ampelokipoi metro station, on the blue line that connects airport with Athens’s city center.<br/>The building is a nice one in a quiet neighborhood with many restaurants with good prices.<br/>We found the studio very stylish and cozy with huge balcony. To be honest, this was the main reason to choose this studio, and it was beyond our expectation.<br/>The place was really nice and we do recommend it.<br/>Bill was a very good host. Very responsive and helpful.<br/>We had to end our trip few days early, due to a medical problem, and he gave us all his support to solve the problem.<br/>It is a very good place to stay, if you visit Athens and a perfect place to feel the local Athenian vibe."
30587235,493904074,2019-07-23,8269654,Nathaniel,"There is nothing wrong with the place a few day's work and some basic investments wouldn't fix, but I would not stay again until that happened. The place could be nice, if the owner actually stayed here himself for a week so he could get frustrated like we did and fix the things that are troublesome. <br/><br/>The main room is very nice. The bathroom and kitchen... need work. The bathroom in particular cost this review 2 stars. In fact, we had planned to spend the whole month in Athens, but our dislike of some of the following things encouraged us to travel farther afield for 3 out of our 4 weeks just to not be... there.<br/><br/>The bathroom: The shower curtain is installed about a foot too high, so water goes literally everywhere. It is impossible to keep the outside floor dry. There is no place to hang the showerhead, so you have to juggle it while soaping and rinsing, or else sit on the floor to get a shower. The water from the shower faucet is either scalding or freezing; no matter where you set it, it goes back and forth between the two constantly. <br/><br/>Also, the door latch broke some time back, and a cheap slide latch was put on. Some time later, it broke (the little pin you use as a ""handle"" to slide it falls out every time you touch it). So effectively, the bathroom door doesn't stay closed.  The tiny amount of soap and shampoo provided seems petty when a huge jar of generic shampoo is so cheap. I've stayed in airbnb's all over the world, and the quality of this bathroom is comparable to central Asia or Latin America, not Europe or even Greece. <br/><br/>The kitchen: lacks basic kitchen staples like olive oil; no wine glasses; no chopping knife (only a tiny paring knife); refrigerator doesn't have a light and is in a dark corner so it really needs it; no electric tea kettle, no toaster; the last two aren't required, but nice and everywhere else in Greece had them.<br/><br/>The bedroom: as I said, the furnishing is nice and looks like the pictures; what it doesn't show you is that the bed is the most unstable thing I've ever seen. Blowing on it makes it feel like there is an earthquake. We opted to put the mattress on the floor because it is absolutely impossible to sleep in there, even by yourself, without getting seasick. <br/><br/>The terrace is nice in principle, but it is completely barren and the furnishings are simply a lone plastic table and flimsy plastic chairs. There was no point in complaining about these things while I was there because most of them require extensive effort (like fixing the water supply in the shower) and can't be fixed, even by the best intentioned of hosts, while guests are there. <br/><br/>In sum, if you're still reading... don't stay here unless the owner's response to this review is ""I've fixed these things"". On the other hand, if they're fixed, this would totally be a nice place to stay."
30587235,507873029,2019-08-12,119442113,Dor,"The place was good, however the apartment is inside an office building and the wifi isn't reliable enough for someone who needs to work remotely. Check in was a bit confusing as we arrived really late and notified the host of the hour we'd be arriving but he didn't provide details as to who would greet us and how to let him know we were there. Other than that, the place is clean, large and has a huge lovely balcony."
30587235,513970994,2019-08-20,57082030,Sj,Bill’s apartment was cozy and very comfy. Neighbourhood is a bit far from the Center but there’s a bus stop right in front of the building and a metro station about 12 mins walk. Bill has also provided detailed instructions and tips to help out. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Athens.
30587235,550616773,2019-10-19,216209788,Eleni,"Extraordinary hospitality. Bill was always willing to help me for anything. Highly recommended for someone who wants to stay close to the centre of the town (approx. 10-15 min by using the bus/metro) , but doesn’t want to spend much money to book an appartment there."

He was so hospitable with suggestions around town and even helped us arrange a taxi ride early in the morning. The place is good walkable location to many attractions & was very clean.

The host is just amazing with great help and tips around the area. There was coffee, tea and water waiting for us in the room and everything was as clean as it could be.

However, it is very close to all the cafes, train station, and attractions. You can walk to most of the attractions and enjoy the bakery shops and cafes.

30628615,702263021,2020-10-20,81810896,Monja,"The apartment was perfect for a trip to Athens. We had everything we needed, a lot of storage, free water, tea, coffee, a big and cozy bed, a TV with Netflix to use and a smartphone that we could use. Alex was really friendly, he gave us local tips (good and tasty restaurants, bars etc, which are in close walking distance to the apartment!) and the communication was always fast and easy. We were also allowed to stay in the apartment a little longer after check out time, which was the cherry on top of this trip. Thanks again, Alexander!"

Everything like a market and metro station to easily get in the city centre is in walking distance. The whole flat has everything you need and was super clean. The location is quit and one day we were suprised of a street market with local products next to our door. Highly recommendable!"
30638600,540848134,2019-10-04,202852295,William,"Vivian is a great hostess and she'll make all the effort to provide you with informations and tips about Athens best spots and transportation!<br/>The place is comfortable, private and cozy. The bathroom is small and get wet after every shower besides hitting the ceiling with your head from time to time. Public transport is close to the property although sometimes they're on a strike, so it's better to plan your day in advance. The air conditioning works like a charm and it's mandatory to your survival in the Athens heat.<br/>:)"

30638600,456956195007115281,2021-09-22,278988840,Gökhan,Tasos's place is very cozy and peaceful. I strongly recommend who want to stay somewhere in Athens which is close to central places. Only thing which bothered me is wifi speed but it's caused by general infrastructure in Athens. Other than that all was good.
30638600,460547052143837808,2021-09-27,423948432,Σοφια,Ενας υπέροχος  χωρος σε μια ήσυχη  περιοχή!

30655657,368018198,2019-01-06,15878736,Samantha,"First of all, Ioanna is the perfect host. She is kind, quick to respond, and has thought of everything to make her guests as comfortable as possible. The apartment is adorable!! Tastefully furnished, includes every convenience, and honestly embodies all the positive attributes of the word ""cozy."" <br/>You should know, however, that the neighborhood is rough. During the day it's fine - a bit dirty/smelly, it feels like an industrial kind of area with some trucks dropping off items in bulk, and like plenty of Athens there are homeless people camped out. At night you discover that it's an active red light district, and that some of the homeless people openly inject drugs. Granted, you'll find people pass-out high on the streets in other parts of Athens, but it can be a little unsettling if it happens outside your door. For two non-Greek female travelers, it was not our ideal situation. If a neighborhood that's still a little rough around the edges doesn't intimidate you, then you have found the perfect spot. <br/>Oh, and MAKE SURE you go to the restaurant right on the corner by the apartment. It's delicious."
30655657,400826918,2019-01-13,144326594,Артём,"I've already traveled by Airbnb for five times, and i gotta say, Ioanna's appartment has been the most stylish one if all!

We had everything we needed at home. Especially the iron and wonderful hair dryer :) most of my stay at the airbnb house was hairdryer and the iron were nightmare for me!<br/>Before I came to Athens, I searched a lot from the internet, but wasted time because we found a file like a treasure in Ioanna's apartment:)<br/>Beatiful, cozy, clean house!<br/>Perfect host Ioanna:) She is the most kind, friendly Airbnb host I have ever met!"

A really good restaurant is directly at the corner. But we, especially my girlfriend, didn't felt very safe when we went to omonia metro station and the area around. Although homeless people doing heroin directly outside the apartment at day was not very enjoyable. After all it was an awesome Trip and felt great inside the apartment."

Ioanna‘s cousin welcomed us and showed us around the brand new and super cozy apartment. We loved the place! Ioanna was super nice and welcoming as well and she prepared a whole folder with tips for Athens and surroundings for her guests. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Athens, you can walk everywhere from the apartment and it is located in a pretty cool neighborhood."

The only negative would be the local area was slightly dodgy with some drug users however, we were told this was an issue for a lot of Greece and at no point did we feel unsafe."

The apartment was chic, neat, and extremely clean. The center was only a 12 min walk away and she provided many details and tips to add to our trip. We would highly reccomend this booking!"

30655657,458557008,2019-05-26,31008242,Ruth,"We had a very comfortable 3 night stay in Ioannas place. Her apartment is compact but very comfortable for two, beautifully presented and very clean. She provided some lovely little extras - tea, coffee and chocolate plus a couple of snacks for the start of our trip, body wash, shampoo and make up remover. <br/>Ioanna provided a very useful guide to Athens will maps and recommendations for eating establishments and days out. <br/>We loved the neighbourhood, a glimpse at real city life away from the tourist hotspots. The restaurant just on the corner opposite was great - I think we were lucky to get a spot there, it was so popular.<br/>Would recommend this place to independent travellers who like to get out of the really touristy areas."
30655657,459999826,2019-05-28,256101791,William,Lovely place! Very clean and well priced. Location isn’t super close to the main attractions but taxis are very cheap so it wasn’t a problem. Definitely recommend.

Appartement is mooi en schoon en zeker aan te bevelen voor een citytrip. Het is een studio en mocht je opzoek zijn naar een verblijf voor langere periode zouden wij een iets groter appartement zoeken. Maar voor een weekend was dit perfect!

30655657,467140026,2019-06-10,38922991,Amy,"We stayed at Ioanna’s apartment for a short trip in Athens before we headed to the islands, and it was a perfect stay. The surrounding neighborhood is lovely, really safe and lots of bars and restaurants around. Locals were really friendly to us. The apartment itself is beautifully decorated and felt like a home from home. We were grateful for the air con as Athens gets very hot (!) and there was also coffee, tea and other extra amenities for our stay. Ioanna’s cousin Michalis met with us on our arrival and was very friendly and helpful with tips for local bars and restaurants. I would highly recommend staying in Ioanna’s apartment!"

Iona hat uns herzlichst empfangen und uns noch eine Mappe gegeben in der wir einige Restaurants, Ausflugtipps etc. finden konnten. Auch zwischen durch hat sie uns geschrieben, ob soweit alles in Ordnung ist. Sie hat uns auch noch ein Taxi fuer den Abreisetag organisiert. Eigentlich wollten wir mit der Metro zum Piräus Hafen fahren aber Iona meinte, dass ein Taxi nur etwa 10-12€ kostet also haben wir uns dafür entschieden. Am Ende hat das Taxi sogar nur 9€ gekostet. Super günstig. <br/>Wir waren sehr zufrieden und würden auf jeden Fall wieder kommen! <br/>Es war ein sehr schönet Aufenthalt! Vielen Dank fuer alles."

Everything was really clean and comfy. <br/>The sorrounding streets were rather dirty so we thought it wouldn’t be nice to walk home at night but actually there were no people in the streets. The place is close enough to the center so we felt it was safe to walk even at night. <br/>In addition, Ioanna was super helpful with everything. <br/>I highly recommend staying at hers."
30655657,528979549,2019-09-14,31361772,Laurianne,"Ioanna est une hôte exceptionnelle. Elle était chaleureuse, sympathique et facilement rejoignable. Elle s’est proposée pour nous booker des taxis afin de faciliter nos déplacements. L’appartement est d’une propreté remarquable. Nous nous sentions comme à la maison. Nous avons été en mesure de voir toutes les attraction intéressantes d’Athènes à la marche. Le quartier n’était pas très attrayant/accueillant, mais tout de même sécuritaire."
30655657,530729474,2019-09-16,46965023,Mikaela,What a fantastic little place! We loved our two nights here.

Die Lage optimal - die Innenstadt und auch z.B die Akropolis waren gut zu Fuß zu erreichen. Ansonsten sind UBahn und Tram auch schnell zu erreichen. Ganz toll die Vermieterin!!! Sie hat einen Ordner erarbeitet, der viele klasse Tipps für Untersuchungen, Restaurants etc. gibt. Auch ist sie vor Ort schnell zu erreichen und jederzeit kontaktierbar.<br/>Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt....alles in Allem ein klasse Urlaub. <br/>Wir empfehlen das Appartement uneingeschränkt!!!"

It is super clean and well decorated, plus in a good location not too far of a walk to all the sites. She also arranged a driver for us from the airport when the metro went on strike.<br/><br/>Although we did not meet Ionna, her cousin helped check us in and gave us amazing suggestions on where to eat and drink. All of the places we went on his recommendation were places we would have never found on our own. They were all filled with locals too; we felt like we had the inside scoop!<br/><br/>This is one of the best AirBnB experiences I’ve had: great place and a great host too!"

30655657,554301171,2019-10-26,178831367,Jonathan,"The only reason I said that the cozy apartment was what I expected was because everyone who has ever stayed with Ioanna wrote reviews that said how spectacular she was as a host. My wife and I will never be able to thank Ioanna enough for all she did to help us to have a vacation of a life time. She was available every step of the way to ensure that we were not just happy but having the best vacation of a lifetime. If you go to Greece, see Ioanna; the best host in Greece!"

Monastiraki square is just about 7-10 minutes by walk, where you can always find place with nice coffee, taverns and incredible roof tops. Syntagma and Acropolis are very easy to reach as well. Just be ware that there will be too much abandoned buildings, refugees and graffiti all around."

Conforme aux photos l'appartement est vraiment cosy et idéal pour un séjour en amoureux. Déco, propreté, tres bien équipé, insonorise et une très bonne literie, accueil du premier jour rien avec plein de conseils pour le séjour... rien n'est à redire. Seule remarque si vous êtes prêts de tout à pied évitez quand même le quartier d'Omonia le soir pas très sur et mieux vaut opter pour un petit crochet par Psyri. Le restaurant en bas de l'immeuble vaut de s'y arrêter au moins une fois par exemple a votre arrivée lorsque le frigo est vide. Nous recommandons."

The place is at a walking distance from all the important places in the town including the historical places of Athens. It's just the type of place a couple needs.<br/>loanna is a great host. She was there to recieve us and went in great details to explain the entire house and the city. She was more of a guide and friend to us in the city. She was so forthcoming that more often than not she would be the one to drop a message to ask for any issues or help we needed.<br/>The trip was awesome and loanna played one of the most vital role in it.<br/>Thank you so much."

En op loopafstand van alle toeristische attracties (wijken Psirri, Monestiraki en Plaka).<br/>Wij werden ontvangen door de zeer vriendelijke en attente gastvrouw Ionna die ons uitgebreide informatie gaf over het appartement en de stad.<br/>Wij vonden deze buurt waar voornamelijk de locals vertoeven de fijnste wijk om te verblijven.<br/>Dus wat ons betreft een absolute aanrader.<br/><br/>Eric en Mireille uit Nederland"
30655657,654061612,2020-08-21,135692828,Morgane,"Logement conforme aux photos. Ioanna est très réactive et vous réservera un accueil chaleureux.

30655657,655252903,2020-08-23,54169551,Tessa,Loved it! Very beautiful decorated. We love the square with the restaurants next to apartment. Very friendly host with lots of tips what to see.
30655657,656845292,2020-08-27,118162191,Lydia,"One of the best Airbnb stays I have ever had. Ioanna was a fantastic host, the local tips and guides were amazing, the place was super clean and the facilities provided were perfect. The aircon was a life saver during the hottest parts of the day. <br/>The flat was ideally located and only a short walk from some of the best sites in Athens, as well as a short walk from the metro. <br/>The restaurants around the flat were great, with fantastic and authentic Greek food as well as great wine and cocktails. Would definitely recommend a stay here!"

30655657,660108584,2020-09-04,54107328,Chloe,"Ioanna's apartment was a lovely place to stay for a couple. She was extremely helpful not only with the apartment, but with helping us book transport and giving us tips about the city. The apartment was super clean, and was nicely renovated with a nice little kitchen and lovely bathroom. The air conditioning was ideal as Athens can be quite hot! <br/>The one thing I would say before you book is to research the area- it is walkable to the city center, and I think it's an up and coming area. However, as happens with areas that are newer and not fully developed, we did see some shadier activities going on if you walked a certain direction in this neighborhood. It is a different experience than staying in Plakka for example. It was fine for us, but if you have kids or are a female staying alone, something to consider. I wouldn't have been comfortable walking home as a single female. Overall as a couple we loved the apartment and it was a great value for the money!"
30655657,668021062,2020-09-26,329994577,Samira,Wir hatten eine wunderschöne und unvergessliche Zeit in Athen! Besonders auch wegen unserer tollen Unterkunft in der man sich wie Zuhause gefühlt hat und einer Gastgeberin die keine Wünsche offen lässt! Vielen Dank

The check-in was very attentive and informative about the apartment’s amenities and the whereabouts of the neighbourhood as well as the city in general. <br/><br/>Ioanna, I believe you have been among the best hosts I have ever encountered.<br/><br/>I recommend everyone staying in Athens to stay at Ioanna’s place.<br/><br/>Thank you so much, Ioanna!"

I managed to get stuck in Greece during the lockdown and Ioanna helped me navigate my way through everything. Ioanna made the entire experience wonderful and stress free. Best host you can ask for."

30655657,757975240,2021-05-14,156992740,Cedric,"Great host, beautiful apartment as pictured and very convenient location. Hence the maximum score. Outside of host's control are the neighbours who are very noisy and although 90% of the neighbourhood is fantastic with great restaurants and great access to metro stations, a couple streets are pretty rough. I would definitely recommend this apartment for young active people or for short stay holidays as it's a wonderful apartment, very well designed and beautifully decorated with a very well equipped kitchen and the host is a very kind lady with great communication who is happy to bring you anything the apartment needs, the neighbours shout and bang a lot sometimes early in the morning from 7am and sometimes late in the evening until 11pm - it wasn't too bad but it definitely affected my sleep and sense of comfort. I didn't mention to the host as it's outside of her control. If it weren't for the noisy neighbours and  in particular the banging at all hours this would have probably the best apartment and host I have had."
30655657,762962300,2021-05-27,5136751,Evgeniia,"Very stylish,  clean and cosy little flat with thoughtful details, quality materials and equipment! but the neighborhood is not for a sensitive people;)"

L'appartement est au 4ème étage avec ascenseur. L'immeuble est situé sur une petite place vivante (mais pas bruyante), et à quelques minutes du quartier de Monasteraki hyper animé. Il y a également quelques stations de métro à proximité. Cet appartement permet de profiter au calme de la vie animée Athénienne."

Where to begin.<br/>Pros:<br/>• Looks just as pictured (it’s a studio)<br/>• Beautiful and clean interior<br/>• Very kind, helpful host<br/>• Communication is excellent.<br/>• Great location. Walking distance to the cute city center. <br/>• A good 20€ to the port.<br/>• convenient restaurant/bar downstairs<br/>• Her cousin is super amazing<br/>• A binder full of juicy information.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>• The elevator is a bit small. It’s not horrible but i’m claustrophobic soo it was a test for me.<br/>• If you’re a light sleeper like me, just bring sleep aids because the hustle of the neighbors can be hard to fall asleep. And the random lady yelling at 2am (kinda funny though).<br/>• The pigeon who hated me for 2hrs. Haha It would not stopppp!! <br/><br/>But would I stay here again? Absolute TF YES!!"

It has all the amenities you might need and is located in a lively neighbourhood with bars and restaurants. We didn’t meet Ioanna but her cousin Michalis, who was really kind and helpful in advising us on what we should do in the city. Ioanna was always available and kindly ordered us taxis for our arrival to and departure from the apartment.

Wir hatten zwei Restaurants in der Nähe, die auch von Ioanna empfohlen wurden, die wunderbares Essen servierten. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr hip und man kann alles zu Fuss erreichen.  Wir würden die Wohnung auf jeden Fall wieder für unseren nächsten Aufenthalt buchen. Wir kochen im Urlaub gerne, aber die Küche war nur für einfache Gerichte ausgestattet und nicht um grosse Menüs zu kochen. Jedoch gibt es viele Restaurants mit super leckerem Essen."

Всі зручності були, ліжка зручні, по 3 шикарних рушника на кожного.  Розташування зручне, метро недалеко, поруч декілька супермаркетів, біля входу у під’їзд цілодобова пекарня. Кафе близько. Усе чудово для нетривалої зупинки в Афінах. Єдиний мінус - це те, що в одній з кімнат одна зі стін скляна, тобто трохи просвічується  вночі пожежний ліхтар над вхідними дверима і шумоізоляція залишає бажати кращого. Зручно і авто заселення і виселення (хоча наша хазяйка запрограмувала пароль на час який ми вказали як час заселення, а коли приїхали раніше не змогли відкрити. Дякуючи гостинності сусідів ми з легкістю подзвонили Лілі і взнали інший код)."

For one day when we came back to the Airbnb, there was no electricity. No idea what was going on, I called Lila and she sent the maid immediately. Turned out there was some problems have to be fixed by the electricity company. They sent us to a close by Airbnb (which is very stylish too) to spend the night. Despite of some inconvenience, I really have nothing to complain. It was not their fault, they responded fast and everyone’s friendly and thoughtful to help us through the night. The day we leave I had to ask for a late checkout because of our flight change, I didn’t really expect they would say yes, but they agreed immediately which made my trip so much easier. The best host I met. Recommend the place to everyone coming to Athens!"

Yorgos was also helpful when it came to getting to the place and giving us information about the local cuisine and how to get around. If we had any inquiries, he was always reachable."

You cannot put a price on that view from the balcony at night, wow! The bed is very comfortable. The A/C works well. We even got to do a load of laundry cause Yorgos provided soap and clothes hanger! Thanks Yorgos! The apartment is located 5mins by taxi to downtown. Make sure you do your research about the area Omonoia. We used the app “BEAT” to summon taxis for rides around the city (~€3.5-€5)."

30693768,521585559,2019-09-01,24377690,Lauren,George’s apartment was perfect for me and boyfriend exploring Athens for two days. He recommends some really great close by places to eat and drink and we walked to the Acropolis from his apartment in 30 minutes. Would definitely stay here again if we returned to Athens.
30693768,523640632,2019-09-04,244893243,Elise,"L’appartement est bien situé dans Athenes, propre et assez beau. La terrasse est très belle et Yorgos à été très aidant avec nous.

30693768,532081123,2019-09-19,82337639,Timo,Yorgos is extremely friendly and helpful. Apartment was easy to find and check-in worked out perfectly. Location wouldn't be better and we walked everywhere (didn't need metro or bus at all). Terrace was great and view was awesome. Apartment was beautiful and clean. bed was comfortable and there was everything you need. Air conditioner was super  and worked well. We highly recommend!
30693768,539781978,2019-10-02,14545233,Holly,"Amazing spacious balcony enjoying a great view of the Lycabettus hill, and lovely little touches such as lanterns and fairy lights. Apartment is compact but beautifully thought out, with lots of cactus decor! Spotlessly clean, with a decent sized bathroom and small but functional kitchen. Exarcheia is lively and noisy, great place to eat, bar-hop, or grab a kebab at 2am, though perhaps not an ideal neighbourhood for the nervous or less mobile. However, only 5 minutes to the Omonia metro stop, from which it is easy to get anywhere in the city. Yorgos was very quick to respond to questions, gave a brilliant list of suggestions of local places to eat, and text to warn us of a transport strike on our last day that would have otherwise taken us unawares. Would definitely stay again!"
30693768,547414669,2019-10-15,114369457,Antonio,"Cactus place it’s a  great place with a stunning view of Lycaabettus Hill, just perfect for a nice morning coffee or a great evening with a glass of local beer or wine, easy walk to the train stations Panepistimio or Omonia and all the nice little places to grab a quick bite to eat, you will fall in love taking a walk there just to explore my best regards for the Cactus team, and god bless Athens."

Plenty of restaurants and bars literally around the corner from studio. Roughly a 12 minute walk from the Acropolis. Overall a great value. Ideal for solo travelers or couples"
30693768,557501622,2019-11-01,41702414,Mariusz,"Very nice apartment, small, but comfortable, clean, with a very good vibe. The best thing about it is defintely the big terrace with a beautiful view!!! The location is central, in the heart of a rather unusual district of Athens called Exarcheia- that we loved !!! It’s outstanding really, having a rather alternative vibe. It is full of life, full of  amazing local restaurants, tavernas, bars and cafes etc, also full of graffiti , murals and streetart everywhere... Absolutely great! Very authentic. Then again, this district might not be everyone’s piece of cake. The apartment is also not far from Monostiraki or Plaka (walking distance). Metro station Omonia some 7 minutes away from the apartment. In the apartment the only disadvantage was the very low pressure of water which made it difficult to take a normal shower. Or maybe it was due to some other problems with the pipes. Other than that everything was great, including the excellent communication with the owner(s)."
30693768,559924082,2019-11-05,8580415,Sandra,Best place to visit Athens. Yorgos communicated everything perfectly via the app. The Appartment is superclean and with many little details extra that make it nice. The area is superb for going out. Loved it!

30693768,571581251,2019-12-01,5144328,Aurélien,Location of flat is perfect to visit Exárcheia. It is an area with many restaurants and bars really cool and not too pricy. But you are also close to other parts of Athens. Our stay was perfect thanks to advices from Georges. And his terrace is really amazing. Thanks a lot. Aurélien
30693768,586634334,2020-01-02,315544599,Yevhenii,I'm really satisfied with this place.<br/>Yorgos is always online and responds pretty quickly.<br/>How-to-get-in instruction was clear and understandable.<br/>We had everything we needed for comfortable living.

Close proximity to the Lycabettus  hill makes it even better, as you can walk and escape the city's busy rush and enjoy the great panorama after a hike.<br/><br/>The apartment has all one may need for a cozy stay and cooking.  It's situated in the quiet neighborhood,  but some traffic may be heard through the opened windows.  After a while we got used to it, so it was no problem for us.<br/><br/>Giorgios  has met us and gave us good recommendations about the upcoming events in the city, which made our journey more interesting. <br/><br/>We enjoyed a lot and we'd like to return again sometime in the future."

30706270,598885370,2020-01-28,36437873,Ora,"This My Megaro Flat was an all above expectations experience. Objectively the best Airbnb flat we stayed so far! The attention to detail by the owners, the warmth and hospitality in the details of the flat, and great communication throughout all made it a great stay. We cooked in a lovely kitchen, with plenty of dishes and pans, rested in an amazing king size bed, and has a great pressure in the shower. Most standing out for us was to use a citrus fruit juicer in the kitchen to enjoy great local oranges, and great nights sleep in the firm, new bed. Flat is exactly as it is on the photos. Check in process was easy, lift worked, and the local area was great for our needs, with Megaro Musakis metro st in 3-4 min walk and a local supermarket same short walk. Hope to stay again."

We felt like this was really our home!<br/><br/>Before arriving to the house we were sent all relevant information on how we we could self checkin (we had a late night flight in so that was very important to us), and use various facilities of the house in both text, as well as amazingly detailed videos where George and Letizia were walking us around the place showing us everything in exact steps, which meant that we knew every step of getting in the house and using the facilities even before getting there in the middle of the night. During our stay our communication with Letizia was very prompt and all-around spectacular ensuring everything was in order and helping us in making the stay as enjoyable as possible.<br/><br/>The house itself was spotless clean, with amazing style and great use of the space, providing a great bedroom with a very comfortable bed and more that enough clothing racks, and an open space living room/kitchen which was we feel in love with due to its modularity into being used very effectively as a working, relaxing, or entertainment space while feeling very welcoming.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the attention to the detail and the fact that the house had everything a proper home would have, like coffee makers (both filter and espresso), plenty of plates, glasses, cups, bottle openers, cutlery, and general abundance of anything anyone would probably need, made us feel like this was our home were we could actually live in the way we wanted instead of adjusting to the circumstances at hand.<br/><br/>All in all we would unreservedly recommend this place, and we are already looking forward to booking it (if we can help it) the next time we are back in Athens."

30709533,531253235,2019-09-17,256743146,Joel,"Apartment a little more rundown as compared to pictures. “Classic” I suppose. As apartment is situated in an older building. I would suggest more updated unedited photos in the listing.<br/><br/>Squeaking sounds could be heard at night, possibly from apartment above. It did wake me up a couple of times overnight.<br/><br/>Faced check-in issues/timing. Landlord agreed to for 1130am checkin however apartment was not ready even until 3pm. Had to leave after for a tour and only came back at night. Disappointing checkin.<br/><br/>Otherwise excellent location."

30709533,416346047849323542,2021-07-28,53434761,Katrina,Beautiful apartment! Did not prefer the lockbox for getting the key being down the street when it’s 90 degrees F plus outside. Had great air conditioning and blackout exterior curtains to escape the heat though which was wonderful. Elevator didn’t seem to work on the first floor.

Communication was excellent, the host went extra mile for us - personally came to check in my parents (who didn’t speak English) while I was on my way to Athens, order taxi for us with a good price and overall was extra helpful and made everything easy for us. Thank you very much Golden Home Holidays for your work!"
30709533,453400803140668245,2021-09-17,272988141,Eric,"We stayed at this Airbnb for our last night in Greece. We were pleasantly surprised with the large amount of space in the kitchen, bedroom, living room and bathrooms. The bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked and the bathroom was updated. It was a great place to stay for our last night. Very close to everything and we walked everywhere from our apartment. There is a small elevator that will take you to this apartment.<br/><br/>The only thing to note is the key pickup instructions noted it’s location but it wasn’t completely accurate. The host’s photos were very helpful though and eventually we found it after 20 minutes of wandering around.<br/><br/>When your taxi drops you off just know it will have to be quick hop in and hop out. It’s a one way narrow street.<br/><br/>There is a convenient patisserie where you can order coffees and breads to go in the morning just around the corner. Also lots of restaurants and gelato places close by. It was about a 10 minute walk to the Plaka area, which has lots of souvenir and other shopping options."
30709533,454041564835276711,2021-09-18,35554117,Donald,Great place. Right down the street from Plaka neighborhood. Good communication.

The home is fully equipped and feels luxurious. <br/>The kitchen is nice and usable in case interested in cooking. <br/>The location is ideal for walking to Acropolis, and museums. It is also the center of night life.<br/>Plenty of cosmopolitan and Greek eateries around. The only downfall is noise till 2:00 am every night of the week.  The interior bedroom is quieter.<br/>Golden Home Holidays was attentive to our needs. One of the toilets did not flush when we arrived."

30709533,467087941473187978,2021-10-06,45574607,Stuart,"The apartment is big and in a fantastic location in the heart of the city. The host is also very friendly and responsive. And checkin was clear and simple.<br/><br/>But we were extremely disappointed that the apartment doesn't look anywhere near as good as in the Airbnb photos. It's in desperate need of some quality redecoration everywhere - and especially the bathroom which actually made us feel slightly ill - it looks and feels very tired and in a poor state of repair (and the cistern leaks water every time you flush the toilet). <br/><br/>The apartment also didn't seem to have been cleaned very well before our arrival - and there were long dark hairs on the floor all over the place. We didn't feel that these were things which could have been resolved while we were there and I don't like leaving negative reviews but this was definitely one of our least enjoyable Airbnb experiences. More than anything, the Airbnb photos need to be updated to reflect what the apartment actually looks like now."
30709533,470702104817110954,2021-10-11,414762799,Se,"Couldn't fault this stay. Building is older but the apartment is really cute, clean and offers all you need including small elevator. Amazing location and walking distance to all local sights with abundant choice of restaurants, cafe's, stalls, public transportation. Host was amazing and excellent communication, booking us airport transport and even allowing us to keep our bags in the apartment until 5:30pm on day of check out while we waited for our ferry  time.  Check in and out process was seemless. Highly recommend and would choose again if we were to return to Athens."

The host responded very quickly and helped us with our questions.  We also met the cleaning lady and she was the cutest human ever and she gave us a hug and a kiss so ... 5 stars just for that.
30723833,479652583,2019-07-01,66294886,Susanna,"Christo's place is outstanding! The apartment is in the middle of a nice and vibrant neighborhood, located in a small an very calm sideway, where you will hear nothing of the traffic from the surrounding  streets. Every touristic spot is in walking distance, nice taverns and bars all over the neighborhood. The Apartment was spotless clean and provides everything for a pleasant stay. Christos is a very gentle and friendly host. The communication was more than great. He answered every question within no time.<br/>For sure, we will stay again in this apartment on our next trip to Athens.<br/>Thanks Christos for everything!!!!!"

30723833,513138928,2019-08-19,483142,Maud / Nicolas,"We had a nice stay. The apt is very well located in a quiet neighborhood. Close from two metro lines, city center, restaurants and bars."

30723833,526694391,2019-09-09,51113686,Elyse,Great location. Simple apartment good for a short stay. It is very cool in the summer even when air conditioning it turned off. It’s a very short walk to the metro (even with luggage!) Great to have a washer and washing line too. Close to some good dinner and lunch spots. Bakery nearby for breakfast. Host was very responsive and helpful with directions to the apartment and check in / check out was very easy. The place is very tidy and simply decorated. Older area and apartment building but the rooms are nice.

The location of the apartment was in a wonderful neighborhood and a great walking distance from the Acropolis. We thank you Christos for a wonderful stay during our very first time in Athens .
30723833,545305154,2019-10-12,6208102,Melissa,"Nicely decorated but a few practical issues. Couldnt get hot plate to work, kitchen light wasnt working, key tricky to get right. Place was a little out of the way also."
30723833,547458522,2019-10-15,12903566,James,"Christos' place is really modern and fashionable, in a surprisingly quiet area of Athens within walking distance of some of city's best restaurants and bars, 5-10 mins walking distance to 2 metro stations, and we felt very safe walking around at night. We didn't actually get to meet Christos, but his friend Jason did a good job of making us feel welcome and comfortable. Would highly recommend for foodie couples/those who want to experience a relaxed side to city life."
30723833,549595978,2019-10-18,17677115,Ramesh,"Christos was a helpful and effective host. Getting to the apartment from the airport was easy. The apartment was clean and perfect for us, in a good area of Petralona. I travelled with my 10 year old and felt super safe. Its abt 15 to 20 mins walk to Acropolis and 5 mins away to the metro. Definitely back again. Thumbs up!"
30723833,551285527,2019-10-20,107595211,Becky,Christos is an amazing host! He was extremely responsive and accommodating to our needs and helped us with arranging transportation to and from the airport to the port. We felt he went above and beyond for our stay!

L'appartement est très bien aménagé, un tout petit soucis avec l'eau qui coulait en dehors de la douche ( problème de joint ) mais sinon l'appartement était vraiment mignon, avec tout ce dont on avait besoin pour cuisiner. C'était un agréable séjour et nous le recommandons. De plus, tout peut se faire à pieds car nous étions à 20min de l'Acropole. Une ligne de métro est à proximité, ainsi que plusieurs épiceries et petits commerces."
30723833,576672363,2019-12-14,208517105,Vladimir,"Cozy place in a quiet neighborhood near the City center (2 metro stops or 15 min walk), and far enough from all the downtown noise and the crowd. Christos was always available for all the issues/questions we had."

30723833,606235294,2020-02-16,147340773,Efstathios,"Christos was great and really helpful. His place is very well located, close to the underground's green line and walkable distance to the city and historic centre, well-sized and renovated to a quite good standard. Nevertheless, I feel that some attention is required to the linens provided (very worn off and tired) as well as to cushions, covers and carpets in the living room (giving away a tired and 'dirty' impression). Athenian apartments are experiencing heating issues in winter (due to financial crisis), but I was expecting to be informed about this ahead of my arrival."

30723833,388138124661005111,2021-06-19,12467768,Veronique,"Die Unterkunft war genau, was wir suchten. Es war alles vorhanden, was man braucht. Sie war geschmackvoll und bequem eingerichtet. Ein- und Auschecken waren ganz unkompliziert. Von der Wohnung aus konnten wir alles gut zu Fuß erreichen - z.B. die Akropolis und die U-Bahnstation der Linie 1, die zum Piräus fährt. Wir fanden nur die Matratze etwas unbequem. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis war insgesamt hervorragend."

Σε αρκετά καλή/οικογενειακή περιοχή λίγο παλιά η πολυκατοικία αλλά χωρίς αυτό να δημιουργεί κάποιο ιδιαίτερο πρόβλημα. Το διαμέρισμα ήταν περιποιημένο και καθαρό , ευρύχωρο και εξοπλισμένο με τα βασικά. Με τον Χρήστο υπήρχε πολύ καλή επικοινωνία , απαντούσε άμεσα και ήταν πολύ βοηθητικός!

The walk past Filiopappou hill to Acropolis is very recommendable! However, we always heard quite loudly when people entered the house downstairs and were therefore a bit anxious during nighttime. All in all we would come back!"

We were in Athens a few days ago and we stayed at Christos' apartment and it was perfect!!!<br/>It is situated in a very nice position, 5 minutes by foot to Petralona Metro Station and you can easily reach the main squares of Monastiraki and Syntagma by metro in a few minutes and you can go to the legendary Akropolis!!<br/>It was very clean and the place is very quite.

30731288,476813102,2019-06-27,91047945,Yanni,"Nice modern styled apartment. One of the bedrooms is a kids bedroom with bunk beds but the other is a master bedroom with big bed. The air conditioning and wifi worked although it took us a bit to figure out the password. Nice clean bathroom and nice balcony, good location close to the metro as well."
30731288,525067745,2019-09-07,79367700,Kristin,Location is close to metro and supermarkets.  Wasn't able to meet Thelxi but her friend was there to meet me and to get the keys when I left.  When I arrived the modem for the wifi was unplugged and disconnected.  When I queried the wifi I was advised it was not working. I had a friend who wanted to join me for the last two nights of my stay.  As the hosts policies list a cost for extra guests I notified the host and was advised I am not allowed additional guests.  The lack of wifi and alternative offer in lieu from the host and inflexibility of additional guests even though this apartment is listed for 5 people and I was only one were disappointing.
30731288,527585745,2019-09-11,12191193,Παναγιωτησ,Very comfortable and beautiful apartment. I am very lucky where i found it free. Was the best value for money apartment. Hosts was so kind and helpful people

30731288,572810277,2019-12-04,314172226,Kostas,The host canceled this reservation 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
30731288,572887260,2019-12-04,504294,Lynne,"Spacious apartment with large partly-enclosed veranda, I spent a lot of time relaxing outside. Good wifi, well-equipped kitchen, everything you need for a longer stay. Good location close to 2 metro lines, and plenty of shops, supermarkets, bakeries and coffee just across the rail line. About 800m walk from Liossion bus station with airport bus and intercity services, and not too far from central train station. I didn't feel unsafe, even walking at night in the area. Thelxi responded fast when I had questions or a problem with the hot water and her local ""assistant"", although he has little English, was very helpful.<br/>Just a heads-up for non-smokers (and this is my fault for not checking) the apartment has been used by heavy smokers for many years so it does smell quite strongly of cigarettes. In fact there was a dirty ashtray on the coffee table when I arrived. If you are sensitive like me to cigarette smells, this may not be for you."
30731288,576307161,2019-12-13,315283660,Αθανασιος,Πολύ καλό από παροχές. Άριστη φιλοξενία. Βολικό για μεταφορικά μέσα.

30731288,727874987,2021-01-31,385453108,Ελένη,Πολύ όμορφο σπίτι σε σημείο που μας βόλεψε πολύ. Δίπλα από δύο γραμμές του μετρό (κόκκινη και πράσινη). Έμεινα με την μικρή μου κόρη και την μητέρα μου και μείναμε όλοι ευχαριστημένοι. Η κυρία Θέλξη πολύ εξυπηρετικη και άμεση στην επικοινωνία. Σίγουρα θα το ξανά επισκεφτώ αν μου δωθεί η ευκαιρία.

30731288,441748953223105879,2021-09-01,154640247,Raul,"The house is comfortable and spacious and in a great place to explore Athens, but it needs maintenance (a lot of lights still do not work in multiple places, some tiles cracked in the floor, etc) and better cleaning (removing old looking personal stuff, including half used products in the toilet for example). Toiletries presentation and quantity could be improved too. Overall, the feeling is of being a guest on someone house, rather than a traveler's experience. Internet is 25/2 Mbps, vDSL, but has poor reception in the bedroom. Nevertheless, I was happy with my stay, the host was always available and the price was fair. Thank you very much."
30733573,368567971,2019-01-07,12977251,Francesco,"We stayed at Yianni's place for a week in January over the holidays. Great communication and check-in. The apartment has been recently renovated so it's practically new. Everything clean and functional. Wonderful view from the balcony of the Acropolis and other areas of Athens. Great location 5 min from the center and near Thession and Gazi, two hotspots of Athenian nightlife. Also next to the up and coming neighborhood of Metaxourgheio, with its cafés, restaurants and interesting areas to explore. Yiannis and his family were alway available for anything we needed. Couldn't recommend the place and the host more. Thanks for a wonderful stay in Athens. :)"
30733573,405525482,2019-01-27,236715851,Vaxo,"I stay Yannis place, this flat is very nice and clean.   I grateful for Yannis father.  When I come back  to athen  choose again this apartment."
30733573,406847376,2019-01-31,62280719,Torrey,"Yiannis’s parents met me at the flat with cake and a Greek drink. His father even took me for a walk that night and brought me dinner. I have met many nice people on Air Bnb  but this was the nicest gesture so far. Their flat is in walking distances to the Acropolis, cafes, restaurants, the old markets, and retail stores. The area is safe and quiet. I would definitely at Yiannis’s flat again!"
30733573,408721456,2019-02-05,157120192,Petros,I planned to stay for 4 nights at Yanni' s place. The place is in walking distance from the Thisio metro station and archaeological sites of down town Athens. Furthermore the vibrant areas of Psiri and Gazi are very close. The area around the house is safe I had no trouble walking back home alone very late at night. Last but not least the balcony has a nice view of the Acropolis ( even for a Greek that's precious).

30733573,413221354,2019-02-17,46383925,Hamza,"Beautiful apartment in an amazing location. Yannis and his parents were great hosts, they live in the apartment next door and they were the easiest to reach, very helpful, communicative and hospitable.<br/><br/>The location is perfect! 5 minutes walk from Thissio metro station and about 10 minutes walk from the Agora and the Monasteraki square. There is also a bus stop a minute away from the apartment building. Getting around was very easy and you have everything you need close to you! The Acropolis view form the balcony is a nice bonus ;-)<br/><br/>The apartment is cozy and clean and offers everything you'd need. You can tell that the place is nicely renovated and well maintained. We stayed there for 5 days and had no troubles at all!<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this place and I would definitely stay there again next time I'm in Athens :-)"
30733573,416133861,2019-02-24,95638583,Alex,"We felt very welcome at Yiannis’s place. His parents met us for check in, showed us around and left us a delicious homemade welcome treat :) all the facilities and amenities were as described and made for a comfortable stay. There was some street noise at night due to being on the corner of a busy road but that’s to be expected when being so central to everything. All in all a lovely stay!"

The resaturants and bars area starts from Thissio metro station, so as we wanted to eat or to drink something, we were there in 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Yiannis sent us timely information how we can get there and his parents were also phone reachable and ready to help.<br/><br/>Nice time, nice people, me and my friend can only reccomend to stay there!"

Sie ist super zentral gelegen und man kann zu Fuß alles wirklich gut erreichen (Akropolis, Plaka und die Sehenswürdigkeiten rundherum)! Ein bisschen schade war, dass die Unterkunft direkt an einer Hauptstraße ist und es vor allem nachts teilweise sehr laut war. Yiannis und seine Eltern waren sehr gastfreundlich, die Kommunikation ihnen war immer unkompliziert und schnell! An dieser Stelle noch einmal vielen Dank für alles!"

Greatly prepared for guests and equipped. Everything was perfect! However, we have the most pleasant memories of Yiannis' parents - wonderful people, very kind and hospitable. They gave us a very nice welcome. Yiannis's dad showed us around, which was very helpful. Thank you for everything! Contact, check-in and check-out went smoothly, and the whole stay was great :)"
30733573,455762882,2019-05-20,177216369,Jose,"I spent 10 days in Yiannis’ place and I loved everything about it. The apartment is as it looks in the pictures, really cozy, well equipped and very comfortable, it feels completely new and it’s located just a few minutes by walk from Monastiraki and most of Athens’ highlights. Yiannis and his father Konstantinos are great hosts, friendly, humorous, and genuine; they answer very quickly an go the extra mile to make you feel happy, whilst at the same time respecting your space and privacy. When I arrived Konstantinos was awaiting me with some cakes and a bottle of Greek traditional liquor from his island; a couple of days later he sent me a message just to let me know that there was a street party going on in the neighbourhood, in case I wished to attend;  they really make you feel how important it is for them that you enjoy their hospitality and that of their country. To sum up, I would not hesitate to recommend Yiannis and his apartment,  it’s great value with a human touch and I think I have definitely  found the place where I want to stay when I come to Athens from now onwards!"
30733573,458425440,2019-05-26,169146453,Gábor,"Good located and very clear apartment, close to  downtown. Bit noisy because of the heavy traffic near the building.

30733573,478818040,2019-06-30,169816688,Floor,"We had an amazing stay at Yiannis' apartment. Yiannis is not only quick to respond via telephone, he also provided us with our own Athens city guide (tips, must sees and restaurants recommendations). We arrived late at night and got a very warm welcome from Yiannis' parents. The apartment itself is as shown on the pictures. It was one of the cleanest places we ever stayed at!  And to top it all off: you can even see the Akropolis from the balcony! The location is great, you can walk to all the landmarks and the metro is just around the corner. The neighbourhood has lots of lovely dinner spots. I've read reviews mentioning the busy road in front of the apartment, but you hardly have any inconvenience from it. The building is safe and quiet. We slept great and would recommend this place to anyone. Yiannis, efcharisto!"
30733573,483179104,2019-07-07,126646850,Viri,"Great place. 5 min from the subway station, and it is really close to the main streets. Yiannis is super friendly and has great communication with you prior to the arrival. He has recommendations for literally everything. Everything was great!"

Met us at the door and answered all our questions throughout - even got up super early to wish us well as we headed off to our next destination! <br/>The place is super well located, easy walking distance to Metro and all the local sights and sounds. We also had an easy time even with a rental car - Yiannis recommended an awesome place nearby that was super accessible. The whole neighbourhood had lots of fun gems and great options - can’t recommend it enough!"
30733573,491358911,2019-07-20,62878819,Alina,"Yiannis is a really sweet guy and he was very accommodating of our late arrival into Athens for check-in. He also included thoughtful touches like a small bottle raki in the fridge and candies on the table. His guide to Athens that was on the table was also so so so amazing and detailed and helpful! Really thoroughly thought through every thing a tourist might want to do in Athens and gave great suggestions. Our early check-out was also made very easy. And, when there was an earthquake, he was very quick to text and make sure we were okay and to remind us not to use the elevator, so overall a very thoughtful and helpful host  The apartmemt was the perfect size for my and my friend and the shower was very nice and the kitchen was well stocked with all the pots and pans and whatnot needed for cooking. Overall would recommend. Also, the view of the Acropolis isn't a bad touch!"

The location was great and we easily walked to many local places or grabbed an Uber.  I loved the view from the balcony and the street below never bothered us!  Yiannis even helped us when the airport lost my luggage for days then mistakenly delivered to the Airbnb after we we left!  Thanks for a memorable stay, we will definitely be back!"

30733573,519756838,2019-08-29,117722627,Victoria,"The apartment is convenient to walking to the restaurants in Psiri and to the Thissio metro station, as well as very close to the sights of Kerameikos and the ancient Agora.  However, as other reviewers have noted, the apartment itself is on a very busy street and it’s difficult to leave the windows open at night because of the traffic noise.  <br/><br/>In addition, while I was there, there was a persistent odor coming from the bathroom. I don’t know how to describe it except that it seemed chemical.  Yiannis tried to figure out the source and said it came from a neighboring building. I don’t know what it was, but I am sensitive to odors and it really affected my stay. It’s possible that it will be gone or that others will not be as affected as I was.  Yiannis seems like a very nice and welcoming host so I don’t want to leave a negative review, but also want to post something truthful to my experience in the hopes it will help others.  <br/><br/>All that said, it is a good value for the cost."
30733573,520789285,2019-08-31,170748264,Lisa,"Great spot for walking. Close to two metro stations (both different lines). We expected to take the metro and didn't at all, other than the trip in and out from the airport. Close to the Monastiraki district, which we loved visiting. Neighbourhood might feel ""gritty"" to some, but we never felt unsafe. Thanks Yiannis!"

30733573,544838431,2019-10-11,175520521,Molly,Thanks Yiannis for your lovely home that was our home away from home for the last 6 days. We liked the handy location to most activities we had. <br/>Near to Monastiraki for catching the tour daily and Metro train. <br/>Near to Central Market and walkable to Omonia Square. Very near to the Dong Fang Asian grocery shop. <br/>We had a wonderful stay and great new experience as being the first time to Athens Greece. <br/>We would not hesitate to recommend to anyone to stay at your superb place in future. <br/>All the best .. <br/>from Molly & David Chen
30733573,547427170,2019-10-15,236327924,Helen,"Apartment was above a main road intersection so expect horns, and traffic noise around the clock. Take earplugs if this will be a problem for you because it is worth it for this very central location with a max 20 min walk to all the main sites in Athens. We didn't need to use public transport once with everything within easy reach. I recommend reading the local information that Yiannis gives you via e-mail (a copy of which was at the apartment) as without that we would have missed out on some things (for example the 11am parade on Sunday by the tomb of the unknown warrior - arrive half an hour before to catch it in full). The air con was much appreciated, even in October. I would definitely stay here again."
30733573,553899465,2019-10-25,2664467,Camilla,Yiannis's apartment is in a fantastic location just on the perimeter of an area with so many cool restaurants and bars. He was very easy to communicate with and even organised a taxi to collect us from the airport. We walked everywhere and didnt need public transport at all! Thanks so much Yiannis!!!

30733573,563226740,2019-11-12,21284084,Duncan,The apartment is very well located for the major sites (acroplis probably a 15 to 20 min walk away).  Also very close to a very vibrant restaurant area with lots of choices and open late. Apartment was very clean and great with having AC in the flat. Only caution I have is this is probably not the best place for very light sleepers. It is on a busy road however its well insulated and I had no issues. For the price I would definitely stay here again

Be mindful of the fact that it is on a busy street, so if you’re a light sleeper it may be a bit difficult for you. Yiannis’ parents were very kind and thoughtful! Be aware that it costs 38 euro to get to his place from the airport by taxi, being charged anything higher is unnecessary."

The area of flea market and antique shops, with a lot of cafes and interesting museums. Yiannis and his father, Konstantinous, are cordial and friendly, they answer all questions very quickly. Bear in mind that the building is in a busy street; therefore, it is quite noisy, even in nighttime."

Il y a également un supermarché à 600m de l'appartement. L'appartement est propre et fonctionnel, il a tout ce dont on a besoin avec une<br/>vue imprenable sur l'acropole depuis le balcon (magnifique la nuit).<br/>Yiannis est très disponible et répond très vite aux messages, hyper cool et nous a même permis de partir de l'appartement plus tard que prévu. Il communique également des pdf avec le trajet détaillé pour parvenir à l'appartement ainsi qu'un guide d'activités et de bonnes adresses.<br/>La gare est également proche de l'appartement, ce qui facilite les transferts depuis l'aéroport.<br/>Je recommande l'appartement de Yiannis sans hésiter, hôte qui s'assure que tout se passe bien pour ses clients.<br/>Encore merci Yiannis ! :)"

All the main sites were accessible by foot or public transit. My flight was delayed, and I ended up arriving very late but Mike was extremely accommodating and waited at the apartment to help get me situated. The place is exactly like the pictures and great value for your money. I would highly recommend staying here!"
30735420,493773372,2019-07-23,80086597,Mathilde,A really nice appartment !
30735420,498054987,2019-07-29,264663979,Logan,"Great little apartment, very comfortable. Sindy is perfectly clear, almost too clear, about the details of the apartment and is quick to respond to any questions you may have. He also let us stay a little past check out time when we requested to do so, which made our stay go from great to even better. <br/>Perfectly located 10 minutes from public transportation and the taxi system is well priced if you don’t want to make the walk every time. In our case we sometimes didn’t even use public transport and found that the touristic area is a 45 minute - one hour walk from the apartment. Perfect for a little exercise during this extremely hot summer. <br/>Speaking of the heat it was incredibly hot outside the apartment during the day but the air conditioning made our time in the apartment enjoyable. <br/>Everything worked properly and the description of this place is accurate. WiFi worked great too. I would definitely stay here again."
30735420,502824916,2019-08-05,277981029,África,"The place is in excellent conditions.  Clean,  nice and safe area.  Sindy replies to any questions you might have very quick.  You will find in the neighborhood around 3 supermarkets,  bakeries and a wonderful fruit shop to buy the best tomatoes and figs!!!  Main train station is about 15 min walking... I would strongly recommend this apartment and without any doubt I will come back in my next visit to Athens."
30735420,508586755,2019-08-13,276095833,Elisa,"Good apartment, clean and well equipped. Host very quick to respond. Would suggest to stay at Sindy's place if okay with having to use the bus and walk a bit to reach the city centre."
30735420,514334828,2019-08-21,283490437,Christos,Mike was very welcoming and enthusiastic upon our arrival and gave us useful information about nearby public transportation. He was quick to respond at any point during our stay and was very accommodating when I happened to be sick during my stay. The apartment was very clean and cozy and is a perfect place for a couple to stay. I would definitely recommend!!

Good connection with the metro and busses. Also really safety door and location.

I hope I will return someday again."

The home is quiet, newly remodeled and absolutely beautiful. It’s spotless with an abundance of snacks and goodies. He thought of everything one might want or need. It is located next to several Greek restaurants and shops in a charming neighborhood making it a perfect stay. This quite honestly is the best AirBnb experienced anyone could possibly have. I would give it ten stars if that was possible. We will definitely be back!"

The view is unparalleled, and the apartment was helpfully stocked with fruit, bread, eggs etc. for breakfast. Much better than a hotel.<br/><br/>Konstantinos was a super host from check in to check out. His cohost greeted us promptly upon arrival, and gave us good local tips on where to eat. Konstantinos was very fast and informative in all his responses. When we made a mistake with the washing machine, he came over almost immediately to fix it and and ensured we knew where to get our clothes dried before our early flight the next day. His thoughtfulness is very much appreciated.<br/><br/>Our Athens experience was amazing, in large part due to this ideal AirBNB and Konstantinos’ hosting. Don’t hesitate to book! we will be staying here again if we are back in town."

Numerous restaurant and shops, the metro is close, entrance to the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum are nearby and Plaka neighborhood is within a 10 min walk.  The house was awesome.  There were drinks, snacks, and fruits to start our stay.  Plenty of amenities in the shower.  What my kids like the most is the extension plugs were everywhere so my 3 boys had no problem plugging in their gadgets.  The view is great.  Just like in the photos.  I would recommend Konstantino's place any time and would use them again.  Thank you."
30739473,431902445,2019-04-02,22922016,Judson,Konstantinos was an amazing host. The location is amazing; at the heart of everything. We never had to take the metro or taxi anywhere. Several great restaurants on the street just downstairs. The apartment was very clean and well equipped. He stocked the fridge and cupboard for our use. Konstantinos was prompt with communication. Everything you could want in an AirBnB.
30739473,435640750,2019-04-11,13796836,Carl,Konstantinos place is situated close to all the tourist location near Acropolis.  Made the sightseeing more relax since we didn't need to go far.  Lots of local restaurants within walking distance.  One of our favorite location we stayed in Athens.

Don’t miss it!"
30739473,439536522,2019-04-19,10447610,Niall,"This place is immaculate.<br/>Even though they are really good, the photos do not do it justice at all. This was our first trip to Athens and I'm pretty sure there is no better place to start from. Firstly the location is perfect, 2 minutes stroll to the Acropolis museum, less to the metro station. Right at the edge of Plaka with all of its great restaurants and nightlife and just around the corner from the temple of Zeus.<br/>The apartment itself is beautiful. Immaculately decorated with lovely modern touches throughout. The comfy couch with Netflix on a big TV in the evening is nice to come home to after a long day of sightseeing. The bed is really comfy and at the back of the apartment so really quiet at night.The view from the balcony is really something special. The fact that you can identify the apartment from the top of the Acropolis says it all.<br/><br/>Konstantinos was an absolute star. Somehow we managed to get through most of the lovely snacks he had left! His recommendations were perfect and he really knows what his guests want. <br/>We will recommend his place to anyone who will listen."
30739473,443130583,2019-04-25,1877396,Anton,"Super location, everything is comfortable, great host. What could you possibly want..."
30739473,449137199,2019-05-06,40352609,Qian,Very impressive experience. Konstantinos is warmhearted and thoughtful. Responsed to me very quickly. Also provided a lot of tips during my stay.<br/>The apartment is comfortable with nice Acropolis viewing.<br/>Walk distance to Acropolis and close to Metro.
30739473,449989566,2019-05-08,17899405,Jee Won,We thank Konstantinos for his warm hospitality throughout the stay. He was a great host and helped us in every step of the way to ensure the stay was comfortable. The apartment itself was located right by the Acropolis metro station and of course the apartment was clean and fully equipped for our stay. Highly recommend this to others planning a visit to Athens!
30739473,451615951,2019-05-12,23788821,Kevin,Stop your search. This is the place to stay. Incredible location near everything you want to see. Acropolis museum and metro stop are across the pedestrian walk. The best view in all of Athens blending the old acropolis and new modern museum. Outstanding host that provided food staples / beverages and was always available. Super clean and very comfy apartment. Great choice !!!!
30739473,454331026,2019-05-18,49998655,Lisa,"Its essential to stay in the centre of Athens as it would be easy to reach  different archaeological sites, museum and neighbourhood area. <br/><br/>It's our second visit to Athens and was the end of our journey. We just wanted to relax and enjoy the local area.  Thank very much for Konstantinos's great hospitality, and to our surprise, he provided breads, drinks and fruits for us, that was so kind of him.  <br/><br/>The location is superb, we spend hours sitting in the living room and balcony to chat and catch up some works, then visited the museum opposite side and enjoy local shops and restaurants. <br/><br/>Konstantinos respond our queries quickly, very appreciated with that. And I would definitely recommend this property."
30739473,455745804,2019-05-20,259232992,Zahia,"Un emplacement idéal avec vue sur le beau musée de l acropole et en plein cœur de l’animation. En bas de l immeuble pleins de restaurant et bars sympa et à quelques minutes à pied des principaux quartiers à visiter. <br/>L appart est superbe, belle deco, lit confortable. Le frigo était plein pour se préparer un bon petit dej sur place sur la petite terrasse. Tout était parfait! Merci konstantinos"

Something to consider the second bathroom is tiny and though it seems to have capability of using shower we didn't.  A/C was really cold.  Snacks, drinks and fruits in refrigerator."

30739473,472695351,2019-06-20,34941168,Amanda,Konstantinos was very kind and helped arrange private transfers to and from the flat and airport. He had many amenities for us to use at the apartment and gave local recommendations of places to go to. The place was very clean and the view was spectacular.
30739473,474508405,2019-06-23,258489409,Nitin,"Incredible location at the base of Acropolis and edge of Plaka. The flat is modern, cozy, and well maintained. Konstantinos is a resourceful host who can address any queries you may have and facilitate a seamless, comfortable stay. Five stars, well done."

30739473,481582945,2019-07-05,19473871,Matthew,"What a great apartment.<br/><br/>I stayed here with my family of 5, was just the right size for us.<br/><br/>The view was amazing, but the proximity to everywhere and the location was fantastic.<br/><br/>15min walk to Monasteraki through Plaka. 10 min walk up to the Acropolis. Lots of great interesting places in the surrounding area - the street it is on has so many food options!<br/><br/>We loved our stay here, would love to visit this city and this place again, perhaps in spring or autumn when the city is not so hot - the apartment was plenty cool and great to escape the heat!<br/><br/>Konstantinos was a great host - made everything very easy and was very helpful."
30739473,482167905,2019-07-06,14602968,Carlo,"Perfect position, nice apartment, great host!"
30739473,484029533,2019-07-08,10398450,Patricia,"How can there be a better place to stay in Athens?  The view is phenomenal... even better in person.  The apartment is beyond impeccable.  Every detail has been taken into account for comfort,  livability, beauty, style.  The kitchen was the most generously stocked of any AirBnB we have found... even among numerous Superhost  Konstantinos went way way overboard to welcome us. He personally carried our massive luggage up stairs because of a brief, temporary elevator issue.  We arrived very late ... he waited and then treated all of us to dinner.  Truly a Super among Superhosts."
30739473,486875254,2019-07-13,19080604,Nick,"The location is awesome!!   The view is wonderful!!  It's literally just steps from the Acropolis, the Museum, the Metro, and plenty of great dining. The apartment is beautiful and comfortable.  It's been renovated and feels like a very upscale hotel with the nice finishes, and the thoughtful touches of bath products, snacks, etc.  2nd bath is a little small, and showering in there, while possible, was not something we tried to do. <br/><br/>If you have a car, especially a larger one like we did, parking can and will be a challenge as the apartment is located on a pedestrian way (though you can drive on it temporarily to unload), but surrounding streets that you can park on are very crowded with parked cars.  It took me close to 30 min to find a spot a 10 min walk away that could hold our 9 passenger van, though I did pass a few smaller spots while looking.  Konstantinos recommended a couple of parking garages but they wouldn't accept the van due to the size.  We left the van in the spot for the duration of our visit so as not to lose the spot, but the metro is so close, it wasn't an issue for us transportation wise.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a 5 star place and as long as you don't need to park and re-park daily, I'm not sure you'll find a better place to stay if you want to be in the heart of Athens.   Our family of 4 (2 adult daughters) loved it."
30739473,489575227,2019-07-17,59731690,Elizabeth,"Great location and amenities.  Our two teenagers enjoyed being able to walk around by themselves in the surrounding neighborhoods, doing some shopping and eating fast food. The apartment had everything you could possibly need and the fridge and kitchen were thoughtfully stocked with drinks, snacks, and breakfast foods. Konstantinos was always a call  or text away when we had a question. We highly recommend this excellent AirBnB apartment."
30739473,494834274,2019-07-25,68705247,Tom,Fantastic apartment in a sublime location. Really couldn’t be better. <br/>And Konstantinos went above and beyond to help in every way. <br/>The perfect Athens stay.
30739473,495423167,2019-07-26,27754824,Ivan,"Honestly the best Airbnb experience, what an amazing place and amazing location."
30739473,499296715,2019-07-31,280012720,Dimitra,I highly recommend this unit.
30739473,504041383,2019-08-07,115986165,Patricia,"This place is fabulous! It is just as shown in the pictures:, clean, modern, and with an incredible view of both the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum. I cannot imagine a better location when visiting Athens. The apartment is located across the street from the Acropolis Museum, so above a busy and popular street but the apartment itself is quiet. We had a fantastic and very reasonably priced dinner at Arcadia just downstairs. Konstantinos was a wonderful host, very easy to work with. He stocked the apartment with all kinds of wonderful amenities: coffee, fruit, snacks, shampoo, etc. Such a nice place, with the best view in Athens, begin your day sipping cappuccino on the deck as you watch the light change in the marble of the Acropolis and end it sipping a glass of wine in that same spot gazing at the stunning night lighting of The same. You’ll never want to leave! Book it today!"
30739473,509175002,2019-08-14,9446054,Alex,The place was great and in the middle of Athens. On two days we had power outages that was unpleasant as it took a long time till the power came back.
30739473,512320253,2019-08-18,11176765,Cressida,"Fantastically convenient, stylish and enjoyable apartment."
30739473,513157237,2019-08-19,26508058,George,This apartment is nothing shy of amazing. The pictures are spot on. The view is amazing. Konstantinos was very hospitable and accommodating. One of the best air bnb’s I’ve ever stayed at.
30739473,515201458,2019-08-22,34299272,Leonardo,"Great location, fast responses, host very helpful, nice apartment. Could not ask for more. Would come back."
30739473,519301260,2019-08-28,2442185,Addie,"WOW! This is a gem of Athens located in the absolutely perfect spot, hop out the front door and eat at your choice of many amazing restaurants of coffee shops. The Plaka is minutes away. You won’t need a car!<br/><br/>The hosts left a fridge full of foods and drinks for us. They were also available for some questions we had and answered very quickly. Home was sparkling clean and beds and linens were amazing.<br/><br/>Highly recommend. Will be back next time we are in Europe."
30739473,522477439,2019-09-02,27596585,Bryan,This apartment is perfect. The location is central and walking distance to everything. The view is one of the best in the entire city! Apartment is quite big with all the amenities you could ever need. Home even has many live plants which I have never seen at an air bnb before. Thank you again for your hospitality and fresh food for breakfast!
30739473,525636363,2019-09-08,1805052,Kelly,Do not hesitate to book this for the perfect stay in Athens. The location is amazing with easy access to all the right places to see. Great restaurants right downstairs and Arcadia was amazingly good food! View of the Acropolis was spectacular. I'm a host too so can be a bit particular but honestly learned a couple of things from them that I'll include in my own rentals from now on!
30739473,527494349,2019-09-11,39450206,Megan,"Beautiful apartment in a pedestrian street filled with stores and restaurants next to the Acropolis! Cant beat the view and all the extras (food, coffee, snacks)! Thanks for having us! PS- the Wi-Fi is great here."
30739473,529127478,2019-09-14,243914363,Yi,Less than 5 min to Acropolis and Acropolis Museum and the street in the front of building is filled with high rating restaurants.  Konstantinos prepared food filled with the refrigerator and a basket of fruit.   Extremely happy with our experience!
30739473,529883513,2019-09-15,69273821,Jorge Andres,"This apartment has a cool interior and the view to the Acropolis is an incredible feature. However the best thing was the hosting, super kind and they even left some snacks for our breakfast next morning, an amazing detail!"
30739473,533092653,2019-09-21,4841770,Natalia,"as many have said, it is a fantastic apartment to stay in. Konstantinos is very helpful. We traveled with a 1.5 year old and he arranged a baby cot and a high chair for us which was very helpful."
30739473,533743221,2019-09-22,7088181,Denise,"Konstantino’s apartment was perfect- larger than I expected, completely spotless and had a great view of the Acropolis. He also stocked the kitchen with fresh fruit, cereal, eggs, coffee and snacks, which made the morning a lot easier. Compared to hotels, his apartment was a great value. He was easy to communicate with and met us on arrival. If you’re considering his space, book it now!"
30739473,535701895,2019-09-25,173361114,Philip,There may not be a better location for exploring the Acropolis and Plaka Neighborhood. The Apartment was spotless and the view from the sizable deck was unbelievable. Konstantinos was an incredible host. Everything we hoped for
30739473,536709620,2019-09-27,81183283,Erica,Beautiful place that exceeded our expectations. Apartment is very nice and the location can't be beat! They also stocked food for us which was so nice and unexpected. Would definitely recommend.
30739473,538694229,2019-09-30,272391273,Maria,"The most amazing view and location you could possibly ask for. Excellent communication, amenities and cleanliness. We’ll be back!"
30739473,542051810,2019-10-06,196388817,Gregory,"Outstanding place and host! Very nice, clean, and well located flat. This superhost cares about details. Well stocked bathrooms with extra towels and soaps. Konstantinos even had starter food and beverages. Well located on restaurant row. Minutes from a grocery store. Metro stop across the sidewalk. We will return and will schedule our visit around this place!"
30739473,545871373,2019-10-13,48876281,Janelle,"Our stay at Konstantinos’ apartment was sensational. The apartment was as stunning as the photos show and the view of the acropolis from the lounge room and balcony was extraordinary. The apartment is really well located in the heart of Athens, above a lovely pedestrian mall and the metro was across the street. It was so super easy to get around as the apartment is within easy walking distance of many of the ancient sites, museums, shopping and restaurants. Konstantinos is an amazing host and he ensured we had everything we needed for a perfect stay including a host of breakfast and snack items in the fridge and cupboard."
30739473,547477233,2019-10-15,254679001,Tammy,"Outstanding place, exactly located at the city centre, supermarket and metro were nearby. Amazing view (both day & night) from apartment, highly recommended."
30739473,551224959,2019-10-20,126022502,Craig,"I have traveled to over 80 countries and have spent nights in all kinds of accommodations.     I can say that this one is special. <br/><br/>1) Apartment is clean, nicely decorated, quiet, has a beautiful balcony on the fourth floor, a full kitchen and two bathrooms.   It was exactly as described.  Our party had four people and it still felt spacious.<br/>2) Location is superb.  Hard to imagine a better one.  Sits on a safe, attractive pedestrian street with numerous cafes, 20 yards from the metro station, 40 yards from the entrance to the Acropolis Museum, 100 yards from the main entrance to the Acropolis, 200 yards to the Monument of Lysicrates, and 300 yards to Hadrian's Gate.  I suspect, location wise, this apartment is situated in one of the best locations possible.    <br/>3) View is stunning.  From inside the room, looking through the window, was an unobstructed view of the Acropolis.   On the balcony, the view was amazing.  You have to see it to understand.  The Acropolis Museum is so close, you can actually see the exhibits inside the museum from the balcony.  Also, from inside the museum, and from the top of the Acropolis, I could see easily the balcony of the apartment.  <br/>4) Communication with the host was good at all times and Konstantinos arranged the transport to and from the airport for me.<br/><br/>When I booked, the cost was within range of the decent to better hotels in the area, but the view and size of the place make it a very good value, in my opinion.  I would stay there again, without question."
30739473,555044054,2019-10-27,24798018,Francesca,"We loved our short stay in Konstantinos’ apartment. It is exactly as described, only better; Konstantinos is an amazing and very thoughtful host. He very kindly helped us with taxi arrangements and was super responsive and patient with our multiple changes. We very much appreciated the fully stocked fridge and fruit basket, which meant that we didn’t have to worry about shopping. His restaurant recommendation was also spot on. I highly recommend this apartment for the location and facilities but most of all for Konstantinos‘ hospitality. Thank you!"
30739473,557012684,2019-10-31,296040849,Leanne,"Fantastic location with a great view of the acropolis and museum especially at night. Convenient, right in the centre of the city. Konstantinos is an amazing host, has loads of tips regarding where to go and local attractions"
30739473,561861112,2019-11-10,13151499,Natalie,Highly recommend staying here great location very comfortable the view was outstanding

30739473,565134808,2019-11-17,33163442,Micah,"This apartment is beautiful, spacious, well stocked and in a very convenient location to site see in Athens. It is set on a pedestrian street with many restaurants nearby and is a very short walk to the Plaka and the Acropolis/parthenon. It was very easy to check in with Konstantinos. The apartment was stocked with different breakfast foods, sandwich supplies, snacks, drinks, coffee etc. The balcony has a great view of the parthenon and is a perfect place to split a bottle of wine after a day of site seeing."
30739473,567682022,2019-11-23,90212238,Paul,Konstantinos war sehr hilfsbereit und hat uns nach dem Einbruch  am Mietwagen geholfen und Stand uns als Vermittler bei der Polizei  zur Seite. Das war top und vielen Dank auch fur die Unterstützung!!!<br/>Super Aussicht und sehr zentral!!!
30739473,578618284,2019-12-18,6021816,Zach,"Amazing place, and one of a kind host. Highly recommended. Thanks Konstantinos"
30739473,582490878,2019-12-27,244988450,Susan,"We stayed in this Athens apartment for 8 nights and cannot say enough wonderful things about it. <br/>The location was perfect and close to all the sights we were interested in seeing. We could walk to everything, including the Acropolis which was 2 blocks away. It’s on a cobblestone pedestrian tree-lined street with many small restaurants. We had 2 favorite restaurants: Elena (just outside our building) and Souvlaki (for a quick casual lunch). The Acropolis metro stop is in the middle of the block and is manned for buying metro tickets and getting information on the best lines to use.<br/>The apartment seems to have been recently updated and was very clean. The view was spectacular! We spent many evenings sitting on the balcony enjoying gorgeous sunsets with the Parthenon lit on the Acropolis!  The apartment pics are very accurate - spacious living & dining area, great entry room for staging our plans for the day, great WiFi, several charging stations throughout the apartment, comfortable beds, modern baths. (You should be aware that the smaller bath has a wall shower so we rarely used that shower and mostly used the shower in the larger bath. Worked fine for us.)<br/>We will definitely try to stay in this apartment again if we make it back to Athens. Konstantinos is a great host who gave thorough instructions, was easy to communicate with, and was responsive to our texts. He had stocked the kitchen well so we had provisions and only made a few purchases at the local grocer around the corner. <br/>We highly recommend this Airbnb and this host!"
30739473,584473215,2019-12-30,109346138,Erik,This place was epic! Amazing location right next to the Parthenon entrance and a short walk to the Plaka. Restaurants and shops everywhere. Konstantinos met us in person and provided tons of food and soaps. A great launch pad for a few days in Athens.
30739473,588113847,2020-01-04,101406945,Ilir,De loin la meilleure expérience Airbnb.<br/>Famille de 4 pour le nouvel an.<br/>Arrivée et propreté impeccables.<br/>Frigo déjà rempli par Konstantinos pour 3/4 petits déjeuners.<br/>Vue magnifique sur Acropole+++. Musée de Acropole a 20 metres.<br/>Check out nickel.
30739473,590305942,2020-01-08,19381094,Mare & Rick,"Wonderful place, sparkly clean, quick efficient communication, helped with extra needs. We are very thankful for all the sweet consideration and nice touches that reflects a sincere gracious host. Excellent location and view as well."

A truly luxurious welcome. <br/>The house is spotless, gorgeous, stylish beds are very comfortable, very spacious, wi-fi and absolutely everything is perfect! It is so much better than the description! And the view is just unbeatable. The Wow element. <br/>Konstantinos is the best and awesomest host ever, very friendly and helpful.<br/>I worked in luxurious hotels for long time... hands down this is the best place in Athens!"

30739473,601360160,2020-02-03,24653652,Jenna,"Location!  Location! Location!  And,  a fantastic apartment as well. We really appreciated this apartment for three reasons: (1) the location is ideal and because the rooms are in the back, it’s also quiet (2) a ton of considerate details like a kitchen full of fresh fruit and groceries, toiletries, and usb chargers everywhere and (3) super comfortable beds. Thanks for a lovely stay!"
30739473,605297062,2020-02-14,148325783,Julie,"Très bel appartement, spatieux et bien situé, restaurants au pied de l’immeuble. Pleins de petites attentions de la part de Konstantinos. Et une vue incroyable sur le Parthénon ainsi que le musée de l’Acropole. <br/>A réserver sans hésiter !"
30739473,605688365,2020-02-15,147338434,Alex,Great overall experience!!

30739473,612910090,2020-03-01,247691371,Bryan,"This place is AMAZING!  It is right in the middle of everything you’d want to do (shopping, sight-seeing, tours, walking to everything).  And it had the best view!  Being right across the street from the metro, made travel easy, and Konstantinos was a great host. Lots of extra touches!!  I would definitely stay there again!!"
30739473,614418012,2020-03-05,329293133,Anamarie,He was a amazing host...beautiful view...I would recommend this place to anybody...The apartment was clean and modern...I would highly recommend it!
30739473,617188771,2020-03-12,24252468,Ian,"The apartment is in a great location with a spectacular view, close to many of the attractions, bars and restaurants of Athens and right by the metro. Communication was pleasant and efficient through our stay, the property was clean and very comfortable and there was even some welcome supplies, which is a nice touch.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would happily return."
30739473,625913217,2020-05-24,21511887,Konstantina,"The apartment is located in a very central, convenient and beautiful location. The view is remarkable and you'll enjoy all kind of amenities. Konstantinos was a very kind and considerate host, allowing us an early check-in and a late check-out. Me and my friend felt safe and welcomed. Thank you!"
30739473,633943713,2020-07-02,24108143,Jan,"This is by far the best airbnb money can buy in Athens. I had the pleasure of spending a fair amount of days here while working remotely online. From the high quality stylish but easy on the eye interior, to the incredible location and the spectacular one-of- a-kind view of the Parthenon lining up with the Acropolis museum, this place is ideal to let you indulge, spoil yourself and experience how the other half live in the middle of the most historical Athens neighbourhood. <br/><br/>The flat itself is a high-spec sensational 2 bed 2 bath masterpiece with fantastic lighting, furniture, dual living room space, walk-in showers and a long front-facing balcony. The fresh flowers on the coffee table added to the wow factor while both bathrooms had fresh towels, shampoo and shower gels. <br/><br/>The view from the living room and balcony is jaw-dropping particularly during dusk when the museum's night lights turn on and the statues inside the building ""wake up"" to show their 2,000 years of history."
30739473,646207552,2020-08-03,43149765,Pablo,"The apartment is well appointed and in very nice location. It has wonderful views over the Parthenon and the Acropolis Museum. A lot of interesting/touristic locations are within walking distance. If one needs to travel further, the Acropolis Metro station is just outside the building or one can easily hail a taxi. Kostantinos is a kind and responsive host."
30739473,652672367,2020-08-17,88459873,Freddy Et Virginie,"Appartement tout confort et spacieux avec une vue magnifique sur l'acropole.<br/>L'appartement correspond en tous points aux photos.<br/>Konstantinos a été agréable et réactif à nos demandes.<br/>Seule déception, le petit déjeuner n'est pas compris dans cette location."
30739473,653317988,2020-08-19,277146743,William,"This apartment gets 5 star reviews for good reason. Location is absolutely superb, wonderful view and the flat is really well equipped, clean and modern. I really appreciated the water in the fridge and the coffee pods for the coffee machine, we needed that after a days travel to get here. I really couldn’t fault it."
30739473,655837572,2020-08-24,85698259,Krishan,"Great location, lovely apartment and Konstantinos was super quick with replies and very helpful.<br/><br/>Would definitely stay here in Athens again "
30739473,658119752,2020-08-30,17981980,Felix,Great apartment across from arcropolis museum with full view on acropolis from balcony. Better not to arrive with your own car
30739473,661422946,2020-09-07,111466936,Calvin,"The Apartment was amazing, you receive exactly what you see in the photos. Very spacious, clean, Konstantinos is always available for questions. The location is perfect if you are trying to see Akropolis or the museum its only a 1 or 2 minute walk to the entrances. The city center is 10 to 15 min on foot and practically straight down the road. We didn't need a taxi at all. There was a fresh bowl of fruit in the kitchen. The AC was very much needed and very refreshing. The Balcony view of Akropolis is spectacular especially at night. Than again Konstantinos when Icome back to Athens this is where I will book."
30739473,662802082,2020-09-11,362745034,Olga,"Dit was de eerste keer in Griekenland en om er het beste van te maken, hebben we ervoor gekozen om 5 dagen naar de hoofdstad te gaan, naar Athene. <br/>Voor het eerst hebben we ervoor gekozen om niet een typische hotel all inclusive te nemen, dus waren onze verwachtingen niet zo hoog. Integendeel, het was een aangename verassing: een appartementje in het hart van de oude stad met uitzicht naar prachtige Acropolis. De kamers waren heel netjes en proper. De badkamer was zeer functioneel en voorzag al het nodige voor een één week reiziger. Alle restaurants en winkels waren heel dichtbij en was makkelijk om zich doorheen de stad te verplaatsen. <br/>Enigste wat ons niet beviel, is het feit dat er in de beschrijving gesproken werd over ontbijt dat inbegrepen was. Dit was niet het geval bij ons, terwijl we een volle prijs betaald hebben. Als argument kregen we te horen, dat het met Corona te maken heeft."
30739473,663607583,2020-09-13,358779248,Styliani,"One word! WOW! This view is incomparable! Waking up having breakfast or in the evening enjoying the amazing view of this apartment was something I will remember! <br/>Also inside the apartment was absolutely stylish, very modern, great taste! <br/>You can't find a better location, metro right in the corner, you actually see the museum of Acropolis from the balcony and Acropolis ofcourse and in walking distance to all archaeological sites! <br/><br/>Konstantinos was very kind, responsive and helpful! <br/>Looking forward to our next trip in Athens!"
30739473,665970417,2020-09-20,25437565,Hilmar,"Great place with a wonderful view on the acropolis, walking distance from Plaka. Had a small problem with the door lock but the host was very quick to respond and fixed everything within no time. Can only highly recommend the apartment!"

Konstantinos was very accommodating, even replacing a piece of furniture that got damaged during our stay! <br/><br/>Staggering location as well, within a 5 minute walk from everything. <br/><br/>I can’t recommend this place enough, he even had COVID plans in place too and was accommodating to our flight time changes. <br/><br/>What are you waiting for? Book in!"

Secondly, the location is absolutely fantastic, walking distance to the major sites, parks and a vast array of restaurants and cafes.

The apartment was well furnished and even had many food choices in the fridge that were a life saver for us after a long international flight and jet lag. Knostantinos is a perfect host - always available and very kind.
30739473,396051627057729065,2021-06-30,65804246,Glen,"The place is located in an awesome location, very easy to get to by taxi or Metro. The building seems modest but upon entering the apartment, we were blown away. Spacious, modern, well furnished!  The bedrooms are extremely comfortable and the beds very luxurious. Beautiful bathrooms with thick cotton towels and modern touches. Konstantinos had every detail waiting. Stocked kitchen with coffee, milk, snacks etc. <br/>Then you open the living room doors and are greeted with a huge balcony and the best view of the Acropolis and the museum. <br/>Our stay could not have been more perfect!  Many thanks the the best host!"
30739473,397536624902707213,2021-07-02,41173146,Aaron,"Absolutely fabulous views of the Acropolis, Parthenon, and the new museum - enjoyed wine on the patio watching the lights change on the Acropolis throughout the evening. Very nice floor plan, well stocked with everything you need, location, location, location! <br/><br/>Konstantinos helped us to schedule a 6 hr private tour guide that showed us all around the main sites but also customized a bit to take us to some hidden gems - it was a lesson in history, etymology and local gems in the markets and restaurants.  Highly recommend!<br/><br/>There are many places to eat right out your door, and we particularly enjoyed a spot around the corner a couple of blocks that serves “Greek traditional authentic cuisine” translates to “like the old times” (can’t spell it on Greek letter here but just ask your host!)<br/><br/>Highly recommend to stay here, we will stay again when we visit next time."
30739473,398969919976862079,2021-07-04,242927460,Robert,Amazing view at reasonable rates! Konstantinos was very helpful and responsive.
30739473,401125796374455237,2021-07-07,93342083,Lisa,"Can I start with “wow”! The view from the home was breathtaking, especially at night when the Acropolis was illuminated by lighting. The Acropolis Museum is also directly across from the apartment. As it was getting dark outside, you could see the monuments at night light up. The location is perfect and right where it's all happening. There are many restaurants around the area, and the shops are well within walking distance.<br/><br/>The apartment is beautiful, modern, and super clean. The layout of the place was very well thought out, functional, and nicely decorated. We especially loved all the extra touches included in the home: coffee, water bottles in the refrigerator, Netflix (not that you would want to watch TV, but it was nice to have at the end of the evening), extra down comforters, toiletries – shampoos, shower gels, pamphlets on the table with all the essential information, and USB ports in the bedrooms and the living room, plus many more!<br/><br/>Our host, Konstantinos, went out of his way to make sure we had a nice and comfortable stay. He was great, and we appreciate his hospitality! He was quick to respond and help with any questions we had. He even made an extra trip to deliver copies of documents we needed to be printed and helped us schedule transportation to the airport.<br/><br/>We loved our time there and would definitely stay again!"
30739473,404727126386301550,2021-07-12,21979504,John,"This apartment was truly outstanding.  It is hard to imagine a better location with direct views of the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum. In addition, the street below was lined with restaurants and the general neighborhood was cosmopolitan. The porch was a great spot to view the surroundings. The interior was modern with top notch decor and amenities. Konstantinos stocked the apartment as well with core food necessities."
30739473,407012568333317071,2021-07-15,4821449,Kristine,"This apartment is simply perfect! The location was spot on, and enjoying wine and the view of the Acropolis every night can’t be beat. The home itself is wonderful and has all you need for a great stay!"
30739473,409086224960897572,2021-07-18,40476502,Ricardo,"Konstantinos place coulnd't be in a better location, right accross the street from the Acropolis museum and under 15 minutes walk from all main attractions in Plaka, Monastiraki, Syntagma and Kolonaki. <br/><br/>The two bedrooms and 1.5 bath are cozy and comfortable, the space spotless and the communication with Konstantinos was fast and efficient; he was waiting for us with the AC on max, which was greatly appreciated!<br/><br/>The views of the Acropolis from the living room are stunning. I would recommend his place to anyone who is visiting Athens. Also, wifi was fast... I wish we could have stayed and WFH!"

He was warm and friendly which we appreciated very much. He was great in communicating with us and made sure that he was at the location to welcome us  on the day of our arrival. He was great in following-up to make sure everything was good during our stay. Thank you very much, Konstantinos. Hope to be back with my family again soon!"

30739473,419984343341628443,2021-08-02,13161342,Donna,This apartment was lovely and in a perfect location for exploring Athens. We enjoyed the views from the balcony and could walk everywhere. The street is very charming - it’s lined w/ restaurants. The a/c was was much needed during the heat wave. Konstantinos was a very responsive and helpful host
30739473,421423106069026456,2021-08-04,15213308,George,This is a beautiful apartments with incredible views. Konstantino is an excellent host. I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Athens.

30739473,429373780778713856,2021-08-15,4232482,Phillip,I am convinced this is the best Airbnb in Athens. Wonderful!
30739473,430860111653980095,2021-08-17,355066,Chryss,"Konstantinos’ beautiful apartment in the centre of Athens was the loveliest retreat from the hustle and bustle of an incredible city, right outside the door. It was beautifully decorated and very comfortable for four people. There’s one full bathroom as well as a wet room for showering and plenty of space in the common areas. And let’s talk about the view of the Acropolis. Absolutely stunning. Worth the price of a night’s stay alone. Truly gorgeous. <br/><br/>Konstantinos was a wonderful host. Very kind and responsive. Highly recommended."
30739473,435237898758812908,2021-08-23,785659,Ruth,This was the perfect place to explore Athens. All of the archaeological sites are just a stones throw away and the apartment was VERY clean & comfortable. Konstantinos was a brilliant host & was always on hand to help - even when my dad left his luggage in the Airbnb after we checked out! Would stay there again in a heart beat x
30739473,436640361444298218,2021-08-25,106720017,Cindy,Lots of restaurants and shops right downstairs. Short walk to Acropolis. Very clean and across the street from the museum
30739473,438092590077164576,2021-08-27,125510981,Debbie,"Great stay at this apartment. Exactly as listed and the view is amazing. Konstantinos is a wonderful host who helped arrange transfers and was readily available to answer any questions. The apartment is newly renovated, fully stocked and in a great location. We met our guide for the Acropolis right outside our apartment door - could not have been more convenient. Would stay here again and recommend highly to others. Thanks!"
30739473,438887196510241821,2021-08-28,6599708,Jean-Sébastien,Appartement magnifique et avec une vue inégalable. Nous avons passé une nuit magique au coeur d'un des meilleurs quartiers d'Athènes.
30739473,440270154027966070,2021-08-30,5814803,Reyana,Konstantinos place was amazing! Great location with the Acropolis museum right across the street and steps from the monument. We also loved the restaurants and bars in this neighborhood more than the busy ones more in Plaka. We definitely find some spots we loved. As for the place it was great for our group of two couples. Immaculate and with wonderful views! Plenty of space for us to lounge in between the sights and nicely renovated. Would stay again!
30739473,441793530628746009,2021-09-01,23175908,Rawabi,This apartment is amazing the view at day ro night was gorgeous and the whole place was very awesome
30739473,448984337993285763,2021-09-11,94870734,Chuks,Apartment was very clean. He was kind enough to allow early check in and late checkout. He was on speed dial and responded to our questions almost instantaneously. Great host
30739473,450437450533117725,2021-09-13,138702764,Pranjal,This place is amazing! Great views of the Parthenon with good restaurants located just below the apartment!
30739473,453303602505385138,2021-09-17,173333341,Lee,"Fantastic location, really you won’t find a better area to stay in. Apartment is on a pedestrian street right above restaurant and shops. While busy and bustling with people, you won’t hear a peep from the apartment. My sister and I slept so good in the luxurious beds. Apartment offers every essential item you might need and then some. Views are amazing as it sits literally at the base of the acropolis and directly across from the museum. I highly recommend staying here for anyone, single, couples, families, it won’t disappoint"
30739473,455520846165801170,2021-09-20,19070521,Susan,"This flat provided us with the perfect home base for sight-seeing and fun in Athens.  We had everything we could need for our stay.  You can't beat the view and we had relaxing, restful breaks between ventures.  A second bath was handy, but compact, so we all used the larger for showering.  I recommend this great flat for anyone looking to stay within a close walk of the acropolis and museum."
30739473,456283325698710831,2021-09-21,78423700,Srdjan,"Nice apartment in perfect location, great views. But, first time we came, it took us an hour to get in as we got no instructions on time and the host was not reachable.  Pretty annoying standing on the street with all the bags, wondering what to do, for a full hour, waiting for someone who is non-responsive to help you get in. <br/><br/>Even more annoying, it tuned out the price we paid for this place was not as advertised on Airbnb, as it is apparently $80 more per night for 4 people staying compared to when 2 people are staying. That is even if you pay heftily for a 2 bedroom place that can sleep at least 4 people and pay the full cleaning fee and all the other fees and taxes, etc. I argued that this is not common, neither is it fair, but we had to pay up the extra  $80 for the night, even if it is not obvious when you book that the price depends on the number of people staying, so be careful. These two things really spoiled it for us."
30739473,465680806879838236,2021-10-04,78022539,Josh,"Best view in Athens, by far!! Very convenient location. Super easy check-in/out process. Very comfortable apartment with everything we needed. Cannot go wrong with that view!"
30739473,469331027739172063,2021-10-09,346113353,Dyantha,"The location of this apartment is ideal for an Athens visit. The balcony and living room view of the Acropolis is unreal. Downstairs from the apartment are several restaurants and retail stores. The host was kind enough to allow us to store our luggage in the apartment before the 3pm check-in. The one issue we had in this home pertains to the electric door lock- initially we had trouble securing the electronic lock for when we wanted to leave but fortunately the cleaning lady was able to reset the lock and then after that we had no trouble. He does specifically instruct not to manually adjust the lock otherwise settings are disrupted - maybe that happened to us, not sure. The home also has a manual key that adds security to the door. The host was easily reachable by phone and always had a suggestion when I requested information. <br/>I definitely recommend this place!"
30744454,360893737,2018-12-22,71103298,Gerard,"Marilou's Fancy Home is a beautiful and stylish decorated apartment.<br/>It is spacious, clean and has all you need and more available.<br/>It is exactly as described.  <br/>Marilou and her children are very helpfull and all know what Greek hospitality means.<br/>This is a great place to stay.<br/>Supermarkets, bakery, restaurants, metro is all present in the neighbourhood."
30744454,363149591,2018-12-28,81674071,Will,Great location close to metro. Apartment was gorgeous online but very more beautiful in person. Marilou is a wonderful host with quick responses and great hospitality. Enjoy your stay!!

30744454,412314969,2019-02-15,56196722,Matija,"Staying at Marilou's apartment was a great experience. happy to say, she provided home made bread, fruits and other specialties including wine upon check in.  Super host I'd say. Very clean apartment with lots of amenities provided in a nice neighborhood, close walking distance to metro. Great place to relax, highly recommend if you are planning a trip to Athens. Looking forward to stay at the apartment again:)"
30744454,421746235,2019-03-10,68603387,Vanessa,"Something I will never forget. Marilou and her son are the kindest persons, with an amazing sense of hospitality! I recommend;)"
30744454,424842278,2019-03-17,13385547,Pio,"Maybe my best Airbnb experience. I have missed nothing during my staying, the place was clean and quiet, which is much important to me. But most of all Marilou and John were so kind, they gave me suggestions about anything in a few minutes, the day I arrived they came to the metro station by car to pick me up (and offered to take me to the metro station again after check-out, but the metro is so close you can easily get there walking in 5 minutes). Also, there was much food for breakfast. A huge thank you to Marilou!"
30744454,443992545,2019-04-27,155400122,Tatjana,"I had a amazing time at Athens. Marilou is a very nice person. When i arrived there was fresh, homemade  bread and a cake. If i had questions she was always available and helped me. The apartment was very clean and lovely. The metro-station is close and many shops are around to buy fresh vegetables and fruits."
30744454,448405921,2019-05-05,99062587,Craig,Very kind host who took the trouble to meet me at the metro station with her car and a nice private flat with some food treats thrown in.
30744454,455795067,2019-05-20,541726,Storm,"I loved staying at Marilou’s. Firstly she came to pick me up from the bus port at 1am in the morning - which was above and beyond! Her place is adorable, so much space and cute touches!! Including water, tea, coffee and snacks. Literally everything you could ever need is there. The location was great with a metro station so close, but also lots to walk to. She then also dropped me at the metro to get to a very early morning ferry. The perfect introduction to Greek hospitality!!"
30744454,463399608,2019-06-03,238802743,Clara,Everything was amazing. I felt safe and at home and loved every single second of my stay at Marilous's apartment.  The decoration is amazing and it's cozy. The neighborhood is so alive and the metro is pretty close. I walked to the center and it's close too. I hope to come back soon.
30744454,465680764,2019-06-08,252540331,Mohamed,"Man this Host!!! They went above and beyond to make me comfortable. Super clean house, they picked me up for free on my first day. Super clean house, local tips and all. They offer food, water, sweets and fruits. They are so kind and loving. I swear this is the best experience i have had, more than any hotel or Airbnb i have been to and i went to a lot of them. Best Regards to them, and definitely reccomending them to everyone<br/> You'll be lucky if you stayed here... Honestly!"
30744454,468715142,2019-06-13,202817917,Doğan,"Marilou was a fantastic host. Although it was midnight, she came to pick me up from the metro station near the house. She also dropped me there after I checked out. The place was quite nice and very close to the touristic atractions of Athens."
30744454,472237545,2019-06-19,162282538,Jessica,"This is a wonderful apartment and Marilou and family, as hosts go above and beyond in making sure one has everything they could possibly need, so kind and thoughtful. <br/><br/>The apartment is in a great location; all the tourist attractions are easily reachable. <br/><br/>The host told us how to reach the apartment from the airport and picked us up from the local station. She made everything so simple for us and gave us a wonderful welcome to Greece. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend staying here, especially for first time travellers to Greece, as we were. I can’t recommend it enough!<br/><br/>We felt very privileged to stay in such a lovely home. <br/><br/>Thank you, Marilou."
30744454,474334275,2019-06-23,16439939,Judith,"It was great staying in Marilou's apartment. It was very well equipped, very clean and had a comfortable bed in a quiet room. I was surprised to see that a lot of bottled water and even breakfast for the next day awaited me. Marilou's son picked me up at the subway station and helped me with my luggage which was great. Everything was so thought-out. I really felt at home and would love to come back sometime."
30744454,482158421,2019-07-06,209552015,Ludovic,"Marilou et sa famille sont des personnes très charmantes, aux petits soins et se sont montrées très serviables. Marilou est venue me chercher à la station de métro proche du logement, la station Victoria, et m'y a redéposé le jour de mon départ. Elle m'a donné les infos utiles puis m'a laissé disposer de l'appartement sans chichis. J'ai beaucoup apprécié mon séjour dans son appartement pratique, disposant d'un grand balcon, et décoré avec beaucoup de goût. A quelques pas de celui-ci se trouvent une boulangerie et plusieurs alimentations. L'appart est situé non loin (5 à 10 minutes de marche) de la ligne rouge et de la ligne verte de métro. C'est très pratique car on est à la place Syntagma ou à Monastiraki en quelques minutes. Pour se rendre à la plage (métro Neos kosmos puis tram jusqu'à la station Edem) il faut environ 1 heure, ce qui est rapide ! Je vous recommande un séjour chez Marilou et rechoisirai son logement lors d'un futur séjour. Le rapport qualité-prix est imbattable et Marilou une hôte très aimable !"
30744454,487655931,2019-07-14,123704517,Venus,"Mairilou’s house was a great choice to stay for our first time in Athens! She was very attentive to us and solved any problems we encountered and recommended a local restaurant on our first night. The house is situated 8 minutes aproximatley from the metro station, where you can get to the famous landmarks easily.<br/>The house is equiped with everything you need. <br/>It gets a little bit hot at night but there are fans in the dining room and the main room so it’s not a problem at all.<br/>Thank you so much for such a wonderfull stay! If we ever come back to Athens we will be repeating this lovely house!"

30744454,493769980,2019-07-23,105795782,은희,"If I come to Athens again, I will definitely choose Marilou. <br/>It takes about 7 minutes to the nearest bus stop or subway station. The room was so lovely and comfortable. Also she prepared some snackes for me. She quickly responded to messages and took care of me while I was staying. When I checked out at dawn, she kindly informed me how to get to the airport and gave me all the necessary information. She is so kind and considerate."
30744454,497205278,2019-07-28,193691375,Alexis,There are a lot of personal touches. It makes it feel lived it. Which is great. I really enjoyed sitting on the balcony.
30744454,504216513,2019-08-07,85267803,Delphine,"Je recommande de loger chez Marilou ! L'appartement est vraiement peu onereux, la localisation est parfaite (8 min de la station Victoria). Nous avons eu le droit a de petites douceurs (loukum,miel, confiture, pain au sésame local, eau dans le frigo) <br/>Bref un séjour parfait ! Rapport qualité-prix imbattable !! Seul bémol la salle de bain pas très très propre"

30744454,522402202,2019-09-02,93267028,Matt,Marilou was a fantastic host. She offered to pick us up and take us to the local metro station as well as providing easy instructions for getting there. The flat was lovely and we were given a hamper of treats to welcome us which made us feel extra special. Victoria is a bit rough but when you consider how close it is to all the attractions and how nice the flat is it was incredibly good value for money. Thankyou so much Marilou!
30744454,524987242,2019-09-07,263248693,Kevin,Thank you so much for the pleasant stay at your Airbnb. Will definitely come back at some point!
30744454,527626218,2019-09-11,177995401,Michael,"Most residential areas in Athens seem slightly rundown and even a bit dodgy, and so was this. But Marilou made sure that I was personally welcomed and checked-in by herself. The apartment is absolutely full of things to make it feel homely and comfortable and Marilou kept in ongoing communication while I stayed (3 nights). Ten minutes walk to the station which is next to a lively square."
30744454,529741028,2019-09-15,265603748,Severine,The flat is perfect and marilou  available at any time. <br/>just 5min walk to the metro station with green line that drives you to the city center. <br/>I highly recommend it.

(2nd floor. Elevator)<br/><br/>Welcome:<br/>Very friendly welcome by Marilou and her son John.<br/>As a surprise, there was a bottle of wine in the fridge.<br/>On the table there were pastries and many other things to eat.<br/><br/>Place:<br/>8 - 10 minutes from the “Victoria” metro station. In 2 metro stations you are in the middle of the famous center. Between the metro station and the apartment there are many small grocery stores. The “Victoria” square has cozy cafes and small restaurants, that are a lot cheaper than in the center. I enjoyed living between Greeks and being in the tourist center in no time.<br/><br/>Questions:<br/>If there were any questions, the whole family was immediately there to help me.<br/><br/>Price/Quality:<br/>Very good quality for the price. <br/><br/>Good-bye:<br/>The last evening we all went to a Greek fish restaurant together.

The host Marilou is very friendly and warm, which is a pleasant experience for us.<br/>Marilou gave us a clear and detailed description of the location of the house and other precautions before arriving. When arriving at Victoria station, Marilou warmly welcomed us and brought us to this beautiful house. Our family of three is from China, not familiar with English. Marilou patiently and detailedly introduced the use of the house and was willing to help us at any time.<br/>The interior is very clean, and the decoration and layout are exquisite, chic and fresh. For example, some lovely pebbles under the kitchen door are placed in a very elegant way, the conch in the bathroom, and the watermelon cushion are lovely. It can be seen that the owner of the house has elegant taste, and every detail is very comfortable<br/>The living room is a separate room. My son sleeps on the spacious sofa bed in the living room. My wife and I live in the bedroom without disturbing each other.<br/>I like to have a glass of wine on the balcony after dinner.<br/>The host was very friendly and considerate. She considered everything carefully. She visited all kinds of maps, delicious fruits, snacks, biscuits (my wife especially likes this kind of biscuit), and considered every detail carefully. The umbrella prepared by the host Marilou for us came into use on the rainy day.<br/>There are bakeries, coffee shops and supermarkets downstairs. The apartment is about 9 minutes walk from Victoria subway station to Acropolis and Constitution Square. You can also take the subway directly to Piraeus port<br/>We are honored to live in this lovely home.<br/>Thank you, Marilou."

30768824,423980874,2019-03-15,62065601,Марина,"Very big but old house close to the center of Athens. The quality strongly coincide with cost. <br/>All good with hot water, its really good in a March when there is cold nights. But there is not complex heating, only heater in a room. Morning it is very cold in common rooms. <br/>Good kitchen with spices and others things for cooking, new electric stove. But kitchen is not clean enough. <br/>We have any problem with buses - they go 1 time in half an hour. May be we choose bad perion for public transport:) It takes about 10 minutes to get to the subway, the path is partially uphill, I think it will be very hard with suitcases. Hard parking if you have big car and if you likes parking more than 10 centimeters from someone else's car. But this problem by Athens, not by host. <br/>Unfortunatelly I dont see Valadw, only her friend. He very nice when you first met him and calm and clear explain rules. But we have a conflict with him in a last night about parking and we leaved house early. <br/>So i can reccomend this house, if you dont afraid any old utensils, if you like to have a lot of communication with host and dont worry about him control, only for confident drivers with small car. And only in summer period."

Le rapport qualité-prix pris et correct. <br/>Une grande véranda qui permets de profité avec les amis. Situé au quatrième étage, il n'y a pas de vis à vis. Le quartier est calme. <br/>La maison est grande et agréable pour 6 personnes. Toutes les pièces sont climatisé ce qui permets de pouvoir supporter la chaleur d'Athènes en été. <br/>Seul petit inconvénient c'est la propriété de la maison, le ménage a été vite fait, y avais pas mal de poussière, certains ustensiles de la cuisine n'était pas nettoyé."

The Appartment is located direcly at the Filopappou Park, so we had two comfortable side effects, wich are quite rare in Athens. It was quiet and we always immediately found a parking spot near the apprtment. <br/>By foot you reach the Acropolis in a few minutes so, its also a very central place to stay.<br/>A little tip , climb up the near  Filopappou Hill and you get a breathtaking view to the Acropolis and the whole city. <br/>The appartment was clean and we found everything we needed for our stay.<br/>Our host was very helpful with tips for Restaurants and interesting locations. We will come back soon to Athens and will definitely take the appartment again if its available."

Double glazing would most likely alleviate that problem."

30848960,475918496,2019-06-25,7107768,Steve,"What a gem of a place! Full of character, spacious, peaceful, and perfect for a large group. It's not a long walk from the center of Athens but is still a great respite from the noise of the city. Important to note that it's a significant climb uphill from the Sygrou-Fix Metro Station, for anyone with mobility difficulties. Check-in was smooth, with Marianna providing tons of recommendation for hot spots in Athens. We always got rapid responses for any questions we had. We loved everything and highly recommend!"
30848960,477469235,2019-06-28,71450312,Mike,"The apartment was really stylish and very spacious. Huge living room and 2 big bathrooms. The pictures reflect the apartment.

30848960,558681165,2019-11-03,24971442,Johannes,"Super Lokation, man ist sehr schnell bei der Akropolis und hat Supermarkt, Bäckerei, Restaurants und alles was man braucht, schnell zu Fuß erreichbar. Da die Wohnung oben am Hügel liegt, gehen die Strassen recht steil hoch und runter.<br/>Die Wohnung ist sehr groß, die Küche sehr gut ausgestattet. Wir haben je nach Wind und Wetter morgens auf der Terasse oder im Wohnzimmer gefrühstückt, und Abends noch ein Glas Wein getrunken, wir waren zu fünft das Geschirr und Besteck hätte auch für mindestens sechs gereicht. Sehr praktisch ist die Spülmaschine, wenn sich durch sie auch die Küchentür nicht schliessen lässt.<br/>Der vom Vermieter organisierte Fahrer hat uns vom Flughafen abgeholt und auch gleich die Schlüssel und einen Zettel mit Tipps gegeben, schneller kann ein Checkin nicht sein.<br/>Für heißes Wasser muss man etwa eine Stunde vorab den Stromschalter für den Boiler anschalten, es hat gut geklappt sich darauf einzustellen. <br/>Wir würden wieder hierherkommen."

30848960,568935750,2019-11-25,9804506,Josefine,"Beautiful and well located apartment. Super clean and spacious. However it's only really suited for 4 people since the last bed (the sofa bed) is a matress on the floor. We couldn't find a blanket for the 5th person, and when we texted the host who greeted us upon arrival asking for help, we never received a reply, even though he told us to contact him if we had any requests. But can really recommend the apartment for 4 people!"

Conveniently located a walk away from the Acropolis. There's a great place for breakfast on the corner of the street. But the apartment itself outdid all my expectations. It's really beautiful and spacious,  smartly decorated and with many surprising touches. The sauna was a welcome surprise. Thank you, Daniela."

We didn't get to see the terrace due to covid but we didn't mind so much cause the house was so beautiful it self... Extra clean especially now with the pandemic it's a great choice. Definitely we will be visiting again in the future!!

The sauna was nice and easy to use. There was a problem with the fridge but it was fixed very quickly, everything in the apartment is good quality and worked fine.  Excellent 360 degree view of Athens from the roof. The location is really central, close to many good eateries and is in between the two main squares. Daniela was very responsive and even let me check in quite early, which was very much appreciated. Great place."

The space is great, the mattresses were luxury-level comfort, and the central location is second-to-none.  All of this in addition to the wonderful host, Daniela, who went above and beyond to help us track down a last minute urgent need  in Athens."

30850552,397498349293094363,2021-07-02,7010133,Hoang,"Super close to everything! We walked a ton and were super glad to always somehow end up close to the AirBnb at the end of the day,  in nice, cold AC.  The place was tidy and clean. There were automatic black out curtains that helped us sleep and better adjust to the time change coming from the US.  The coffee shop across the apartment, Coffee Lab, was a nice bonus!"

30850552,405524873652486891,2021-07-13,189438177,Justin,"This lovely renovated apartment is everything you need if you stay in Athens. It was very close to all the main attractions and the metro. It  was very clean and had more than enough space for the three of us traveling. The bedrooms were spacious and clean. The blinders and shutters were a good feature if you needed privacy. The roof has a view of the acropolis, which you have access to. However due to Covid, it was closed by the landlord. The host, Daniela, was very responsive via (Hidden by Airbnb) and helped us with all our needs. If you find yourself in Athens, stay here."
30850552,406225797998868613,2021-07-14,133595611,Mariyka,Très belle et très fonctionnel appartement! Notre séjour était parfait 
30850552,407743485973134824,2021-07-16,60309469,Andrea,"We only stayed for one night on our way back home to the states. Let me tell you though; that bathroom is exactly what you need to after a long day of traveling! The window you can open in the shower let’s the sun shine in and it’s wonderful. The apartment is on the top floor tucked away in the corner. So it’s nice and quiet and you can get a good nights rest. Great location! You walk out the front door of the building and there are so many restaurants, unique bars, and shops to choose from."
30850552,409859672370394391,2021-07-19,47196710,Gabriella,"This was a lovely apartment in the city center, close to everything and the facilities were amazing. Clean and you had everything you needed! <br/>The only downside is that there were no free parking, or you couldn’t really leave it just anywhere near the apartment."
30850552,412786460618519120,2021-07-23,86600136,Billy,Daniela’s place is amazing!!! The location is wonderful and it is located at the center of everything around Athens.  The place was fully furnished with some awesome amenities and I have never felt so secure within an Airbnb ever !!!!
30850552,414916132663104794,2021-07-26,95523721,Alessio,"The flat is centrally located 5 minutes walking from the city center and it allows to access and visit all parts of Athens really quickly. The rooms are spacious and well cleaned, and in general the apt fits well for 4 people!<br/><br/>In the description on Airbnb, there is a strong highlight on the possibility to see the Acropoli from top with a nice view from the rooftop. However, this expectation has not been satisfied as the door was always closed and the host was not able to sort the problem out.<br/><br/>Moreover, from an host’s availability and collaboration we are not satisfied. The host took hours to reply to our questions or never responded, when we asked to leave just the suitcase the last day for few hours she refused. Personally I expect more from an host with a flat in the middle of a Capital."
30850552,416426093739704038,2021-07-28,35874285,Amy,"Spacious apartment in a lively area with lots of shopping and dining. The immediate surroundings (empty storefronts on the block) and the lobby (which is a bit rundown) were not the nicest, but once you enter the space, it is very nice. There are blackout shades and guards on the windows that are automatic, which was a great touch. The shower and sauna are also very nice, and wonderful for unwinding after traveling. I also appreciated that the bedrooms were quiet, which helped me sleep peacefully at night."
30850552,417072394107036322,2021-07-29,33045315,Tiffany,"Daniela and her crew were accommodating, professional and welcoming. The apartment felt clean and was very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again."

Loved the blackout shutters and modern air-con, which meant we were so comfortable and slept very well. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this place to others."
30850552,419285459034135765,2021-08-01,73616426,Αλέξης,"Το διαμέρισμα δεν υπάρχει. Η διαμονή μας ήταν εξαιρετικότατη. Το διαμέρισμα μεγάλο (ιδανικό για παρέες 3-4 ατόμων), πλήρως ανακαινισμένο, με εξαιρετικές συσκευές, ενώ η σάουνα στο μπάνιο μας κέρδισε. Ο χώρος πεντακάθαρος, όμορφος, ενώ η κεντρική του τοποθεσία βοηθάει στο να πάρεις μια γερή δόση της Αθήνας. Το συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα!!"
30850552,420786395474085665,2021-08-03,240438616,Gaby,"So glad we picked this apartment.  15 min to the Parthenon, 5 minutes to luxury shops, and 5 minutes to the center of the city. This apartment was located in the perfect place and is a MUST for anyone seeing to explore the city by foot. The apartment was exactly as described and had everything you needed and more (sauna, air conditioning, TV with Netflix, black out curtains, etc.) Definitely a great value. I would recommend this place to anyone I know visiting Athens!"

Man kann nicht wie versprochen auf das Dach daher waren wir von dem<br/>Namen und der Beschreibung leider sehr enttäuscht. Scheint auch nicht neu zu sein, dass man nicht hoch kann. Die Beschreibung und der Name sollten  aktualisiert werden , da “acropolis dream apartment” mit Perfektem Blick vom Dach leider nicht zutrifft."

The apartment was very roomy, and for its price we ended up getting a whole extra bedroom! <br/><br/>Would have loved to try out the sauna, but we skipped it cause of the summer weather. Hope to try it out next time!"
30850552,435192989698282473,2021-08-23,48369384,Elijah,"Nicely renovated apartment in great location. Beds were comfortable, air conditioning in each room, nice kitchen set up, and nice shower/sauna.

30854835,508587863,2019-08-13,34930023,Michael,"Unbeatable location to all the sites in Athens. The flat is located on a quiet road just off the main walking mall in Athens, and an easy two minutes down to the Agora and Monesteraki Metro. The flat is clean and very spacious, with two rooms with pull out sofas that make it easy to accommodate more, or just relax. We were able to walk around in the heat and take short breaks at the house for our time, which was very convenient. Overall great value for money. Also Ceby was very responsive, and managed to get us into the flat literally minutes after we booked. She stayed in touch throughout our stay which was very kind and considerate. We would stay again for sure."

Very much appreciated! <br/>The house is perfect, spacious and so well located in the neighbourhood of Plaka, which<br/> is beautiful and charming and so central to visit Athens and so close to the Acropolis.<br/>We would stay here again - we travelled as a Family (2 adults and 2 children).<br/>Filipa"

The location was absolutely perfect for the couple days we had in Athens; right in the heart of Plaka near the shops, and much closer walking distance to Acropolis, Stygmata and Monastiraki Squares than expected.  The only potential obstacle for our time in Athens was how to get to the apartment upon arrival from the airport, which she quickly offered a solution by arranging a driver to pick us up. I will refer Christina to anyone I know traveling through Athens."
30854835,523188273,2019-09-03,289265784,Lisa,This was my first time using AirBnB and Christina made it effortless and super simple.  The place was great and and in a prime location.  About a 7 min walk from Syntagma Square and about 15 min walk from the the Acropolis.  Plenty of great restaurants and shopping around the area.  Christina was extremely informative and helped me figure out how I was going to make my 6 am flight since the metro does not start running until 530am and taxis or using the BEAT (similar to Uber) at that time of hour is around 50 Euros.  Luckily the bus runs 24-7 and the stop to the Airport is located at Syntagma Square.  She was quick to respond if I needed anything.  I would def not hesitate to stay here again if I’m ever back in Athens.
30854835,527491773,2019-09-11,220536514,Alfred,The location is great and Christina is very helpful.
30854835,528395020,2019-09-13,70038455,Melanie,"Fabulous apartment - super central to all of Athens’ major attractions. It is just off the main market road and so there are dozens of places to eat, drink and shop within close proximity as well. Cristina is fabulous, with loads of local tips. Thoroughly recommend."
30854835,529068630,2019-09-14,112166511,Jean,"Our overnight ferry ride from Crete was cancelled the day of its intended departure. Lucky for us, Christina's place was available on short notice. We arrived late at night  but she was there to help guide us from the airport to the building, let us in, and show us around. There were even snacks waiting in the fridge for us! The bed was comfortable, including the pull out sofa bed, and the whole house was charming. Located right by major shopping, food, transit, and historical locations!"
30854835,530650981,2019-09-16,230322913,Beverley,Wonderful location and easily accessible to Plaka and the Acropolis.<br/>Christina is fantastic host and bought us a complimentary Greek Goats cheese... we are hooked!!!<br/> Dry quiet location yet 1 minute from the main tourist spots.
30854835,532205056,2019-09-19,145714069,Hannia,EXCELENTE UBICACION. Christina muy amable
30854835,535758688,2019-09-25,82884239,Jeffrey,Spacious and clean. Very close to all the best places and sights in Athens yet on a quiet side street that feels far removed from the bustle of the tourists and the city.  Host was very responsive to our questions. When in Athens this is a great place to stay.
30854835,539785675,2019-10-02,131562862,Karan,Christina is a great host and her place is perfect! Amazing location and everything you need. I’ll be back!

30854835,552152364,2019-10-21,3673174,Maryla,"Super accueil par Chrisina qui parle d'ailleurs parfaitement français ! L'appartement est tout à fait conforme aux photos et vraiment très bien situé : dans une petite rue tranquille au calme, mais littéralement à quelques mètres des rues touristiques. Tout est accessible à pied. Il est aussi proche de Syntagma et Monastiraki, les deux stations de métro principales (pour accéder au port de ferry ou à l'aéroport). Il est au rdc donc un peu sombre, mais on a toute la journée pour faire le plein de soleil grec à l'extérieur."
30854835,556279036,2019-10-29,284460011,Jean-François,très bon accueil de Christina? l'appartement est très bien situé presque au pied de l'Acropole
30854835,558710661,2019-11-03,104272798,Suzie,Situated in such a good location in the heart of Athens.  We booked last minute and we had such quick responses and the apartment was spacious! Would recommend!
30854835,562016680,2019-11-10,55054212,Helen,"This place was everything we needed! Close to literally everything! Cute cafe 2 minutes away, shopping and restaurants all around, close to Acropolis (walking distance!), trains, buses. Definitely recommend staying here. Christina went above and beyond to help us navigate and gave so many great suggestions of places to go/eat. Very worth every penny. Can’t wait to come back to Plaka!"
30854835,563250941,2019-11-12,98972465,Jesse,"Christina's place is amazing! The location is tops, the couches are so relaxing (and much needed after a full day's of walking), the shower is awesome, the bed is comfy and Christina is a thoughtful host. She was friendly and professional in her responses before, after check-in and throughout my stay. She gave me great hints of places to go around Athens and Plaka. The only bad thing about my stay...I couldn't stay longer. I was there a short time, but her recommendations were spot on. She also helped set up a taxi the morning of my flight through a good friend.<br/>For your first time in Athens, or first time in the Plaka neighborhood, this is a great location! Definitely worth the stay :)"
30854835,583704574,2019-12-29,93534015,Juan Manuel,"La calificación de la experiencia sería: correcta!. Christina tuvo dos detalles: esperarnos con una botella de vino y con alimentos y condimentos bàsicos que facilitan la estadía. Sí querés ir a Plakka, Christina es muy correcta y El depto. acogedor."
30854835,588788360,2020-01-05,20734224,Logan,Excellent apartment and kind host. Christina arranged to meet us at the apartment even though we arrived rather late from the airport. She made sure everything in the apartment was in order before leaving. The apartment itself is perfectly located on a rather quiet street in the Plaka neighborhood. All of the major sights of Athens are within easy walking distance.
30854835,611172043,2020-02-26,8830937,Andy,"The apartment is very comfortable and in a prime location. It was very quiet at night. We had a great stay, walking to every sight we wanted to visit. It was just the two of us and there would have easily been room for four. The sofas and bed are very comfortable. The tap water is as nice as mineral water.  Highly recommended."

30854835,445382246219640699,2021-09-06,39693217,Hanna,"Christina is a super host! She gave us all the information we needed for a pleasant stay and she even stayed up late to be able to welcome us in person when we arrived with a late night flight! The apartment is perfect for a stay in Athens, the location is so close to everything you need to see but still very quiet for a good night’s sleep including airconditioning. We would definitely recommend Christina’s place to stay in Athens!"
30854835,455520937808487783,2021-09-20,161189936,Russell,"In the lead up to my trip, Christina was incredibly welcoming and helpful.

The only thing that is missing is some storage space for clothes etc but this is not an issue for shortstays and for me it was fine even for 2 months.<br/>The apartment is located in Ampelokipi with few minutes walking distance to bus or metro stops, supermarket and restaurants etc. <br/>To summarise, I had a fantastic stay and Yiannis was very helpful with everything I needed! I definitely recommend staying here."

The apartment is conveniently located (about 5 minutes away from the blue metro line and just a couple of minutes away from Kifisias / Mesogeion and Panormou). There are many restaurants, cafes, and shops within a couple of minutes. Yiannis is a great host. The first couple of days the elevator was broken but he was very accommodating. The place might be a little small for 2 people with big pieces of luggage. I wish the bathroom was a little bigger. Other than that it had everything necessary to make my stay comfortable."

Η τιμή είναι πολύ καλή και ο Γιάννης ένας εξαιρετικός οικοδεσπότης, που απαντούσε αμέσως σε ό,τι κι αν χρειαζόμασταν.<br/>Το μόνο αρνητικό ήταν ότι το παράθυρο του μπάνιου ήταν χαλασμένο, και συνεπώς δεν άνοιγε, το ίδιο και η συρόμενη πόρτα του που δεν έκλεινε καλά. Αυτό είχε ως αποτέλεσμα να πρέπει να ανοίγουμε το παράθυρο του δωματίου για να αερίζεται ο χώρος, ενώ όντας ζευγάρι, ήταν λίγο άβολη η κατάσταση. Αν διορθωθούν αυτά τα 2, νομίζω ότι ο χώρος είναι value for money και σε πολύ καλό σημείο. Ευχαριστούμε πολύ τον Γιάννη και πάλι!"

It’s about 5-10 Minutes from the metro station, a quite quiet area but with a lot of cafes/restaurants around the corner at any time of the day and definitely more safe than the places in the center of the city.

We often visit Athens but it's the first time we chose to stay in this bustling area just a stone's throw away from the centre (Victoria station less than 10') away from the tourist 'traps'. More to the fact that the Archeological Museum is about 5' on foot, it was very exciting to discover the tavernas and cafes of the area, populated by the Athenian literati and students.<br/>The flat apparently has just been refurbished; everything was brand new, stylish and spotlessly clean. Host is the loveliest person, that went out of his way to help us. Amazing value for money; definetely would stay there again!"

We felt immediatly at home. The communication and the welcoming was perfectly organised. The answers came quick and we were very well instructed when we arrived. The neighbourhood is just great. It is very close to everything you should see and visist in Athens and lots of interesting things are even in walking distance. It is also a real metropolitan neighbourhood with fantastic cafes, bars, restaurants, tavernas. Bakery, Supermarket, etc. also just around the corner. Even if the apartment is close to a big street and in the middle of a lively neighbourhood, it is very quite! Perfect place to explore Athens. I can only highly recommend - we will come back :-)"

You have everything to feel like at home: hairdryer, iron, coffee machine, comfortable 2 big beds and sofa. The location is great, in city Centre, safe, close to metro station and near 2 supermarkets. I highly recommend Toni apartment for a wonderful stay in Athene. Also, worth to mention that you can leave your luggage at Toni’s office until check in, so, very convenient. A great and receptive host to our needs, an wonderful apartment, just perfect for a vacation in Atene."

You will find that it is one of the most dangerous places to be in Athens)<br/>- Felt extremely unsafe when walking towards the city centre (eg. cat calling, fights, drug on the streets)<br/>- Not very near the centre + uncomfortable walk"

WiFi was great! Awful location as it is a very rough area! But the building is very secure and your very close to all tourist spots!

If only girls will stay in apartment, I would recommend another location, I did not feel comfortable passing groups of men standing in the area of our apartment. As Toni's apartments has many choices, I would just choose another one."

The location was also perfect for us, one 10 minute metro journey away from the centre of Athens and only 9€ for a 5 day pass. On top of that, we arrived a lot earlier than the check in and Toni was super flexible and accommodating. We’d definitely stay again!"

Surtout équipé d’une machine à laver, très pratique lorsqu’on sait qu’il est difficile de trouver une laverie en Grèce. Le quartier peut paraître peu accueillant au départ mais c’est en fait le reflet d’Athènes. De très bon petits restaurants à proximité ( quartier Exarchia derrière le musée) , à proximité du métro, du musée archéologique (à voir !), bref super !<br/>Hôtes très réactif lorsque nous avons eu besoin de lui, même le soir, c’est très appréciable bravo et merci à lui"

The apartment was clean, perfectly equipped and its location was suitable for our trips to the city (museum, acropolis, restaurants etc.). We also appreciated the cards with tips (important phone numbers, must-see places, info about check-in and check-out) and Toni’s help with our transfer to the airport. Toni’s apartment was a cozy oasis in the hot city of Athens and we enjoyed our stay there very much."

30895556,535712939,2019-09-25,126757542,Charlie,"Overall the stay was pretty good. The apartment was well equipped and clean. The check in with Stathis was great, as was the communication with Toni. Arranging transfers and taxis was really easy too. <br/><br/>However, the location of the flat was pretty dreadful. As a newcomer to the city, as I presume most people staying here will be, we didn’t know how bad the area was, but it was really rough and dirty. Lots of people hanging around the streets and overflowing bins outside the apartment. <br/><br/>It was a 25-30 min walk to the Acropolis which is not too bad, but the walk you had to take was through some very sketchy areas. <br/><br/>Overall, 3/5."
30895556,539817249,2019-10-02,2934739,Gerry,"Comfortable enough apartment; check-in fine. Located near the archeological museum and some restaurants. No natural light, so was gloomy. Very clean and modern design, however. We did have to purchase our own toilet wipes; we were only given two rolls for a five night stay. Toni did deliver a couple more on our final day but it was too late by then. He did arrange our transfer to the airport and that service was excellent. There are more homely options available in Athens."
30895556,543180482,2019-10-07,228458773,Emily,"Clean and easy to find! Checkin was great and we had everything we needed. We were told at check-in that we could park on the street and our car window was unfortunately broken right outside the apartment - so that was frustrating. I would suggest finding monitored, overnight parking if you have a car."
30895556,545405405,2019-10-12,33498989,Shantanu,Toni's apartment is great. It's near the metro and near the city centre as well. The place was beautiful and sparkling clean. We loved it.

30895556,565241867,2019-11-17,9863536,Jake,What a great spot! Centrally located and only a quick walk and metro ride to all the sights. Getting to stay in a non-tourist area was exactly why we booked through Air BnB so this was perfect. It's very much a college neighborhood with a great nightlife and youthful atmosphere.

30902346,459943844,2019-05-28,66479206,Adi,"It was a perfect place for the 9 of us! Aris was beyond helpful from start to finish, willingly meet you at the train station and walk you over to the apartment, give you a solid run down, provides tip guides and all the essentials. The place is just amazing, very big, super clean and the beds comfortable. It’s close to the metro, so you have easy access to Athens and all its sights. Anyone who stays here is lucky and in great hands, trust. I hope to be back in Athens in the future, and I already know where I’d stay in Athens. Thanks again, Aris!"
30902346,461312255,2019-05-31,19335905,Eyal,"Aris's place was amazing! The place was very clean, nice and looked exactly like the pictures. It had all amenities I could have asked for. Apartment was spacious, modern furnished with designed details and the beds very comfy. The flat was next to the Victoria metro and I loved it so much cause I could easily see Athens. There were also nice restaurants and cafes around Victoria square. Above all! Aris was very easy and quick to communicate with and gave great recommendations for the city! I would highly recommend Aris's place and stay here again without second thought! Thank you!!"
30902346,465744434,2019-06-08,182362459,Cheng Yao,Nice place
30902346,467226201,2019-06-10,162266367,Qifeng,The house is much better than expected. Aris is very warmthful. Each room is equipped with air conditioner. And I will recommend the transfer from airport to the house it’s very convenient. The location is in the center of the city . Anyway a very nice experience
30902346,474448596,2019-06-23,14661432,Lata,The apartment is exactly as described. Proximity to  Victoria station is a boon as we could easily get to the main attractions. Also lots of food options and supermarkets nearby.  8 of us stayed comfortably at the apartment.  Everything was brand new and Netflix kept the kids busy. Highly recommended.
30902346,479640033,2019-07-01,266468304,Nikolaos,"Πολύ άνετο και καθαρό περιβάλλον, εξαιρετικός ο ιδιοκτήτης. Δίπλα στο μετρό. Ότι κατάστημα χρειαστεί είναι κοντά. Very comfortable and clean house. The owner is a delightful character. The house is next to subway for easy transport and in the neighborhood  there is every kind of store you might need."
30902346,484061592,2019-07-08,101581161,Julia,"El alojamiento está impecable. La casa está totalmente reformada y es muy agradable. La ubicación es buena puesto que tiene una parada de metro al lado y el museo arqueológico muy cerca, pero la calle se ve que está en una zona un tanto marginal. <br/>Aristotelis, el dueño, nos recibió a la llegada y nos dio todo tipo de indicaciones y recomendaciones sobre la casa y sobre nuestra estancia en Atenas."
30902346,486691027,2019-07-13,53695085,Pedro,"flat is fine, just as shown in the pictures. front bedrooms get a lot of noise from the street, it was difficult to have a tranquil sleep. we definetely did not enjoy the neighborhood, it feels unsafe and decadent, compared to other places we have stayed in Athens in the previous 3 times we have been here. however it is indeed very close to Victoria subway station. you have to take care big care with pocket pickers - unfortunately my wife got robbed in her way out from Victoria metro station. Aris was very supportive all the time and we enjoyed the flat. but would not stay here again, due to the location."
30902346,488498409,2019-07-15,33009778,Tanja,"We had a great experience in Aris 's place! It is very comfortable, well equipped, perfect for a stay. It is particularly suitable for group of people, families. Kids really enjoyed having Netflix . Aris is really super host-  quick and smooth check in, local tips and support. We'll be back surely. Take care Aris, all the Best!<br/>Tanja"
30902346,491429686,2019-07-20,130165024,L Maritza,"Ari, es muy buen anfitrión, el lugar muy amplio,  acogedor y limpio. lo único negativo es el vecindario. Da miedo andar de noche e inclusive de día."
30902346,494839546,2019-07-25,81475341,Matt,"Aris’ apartment is great - big, spacious rooms and the two full bathrooms, really helps for bigger groups.  He provided a ton of info prior to arrival and was always very responsive to our questions during our stay, including going the extra mile helping us with a lost baggage situation and coordinating the independent arrival times of multiple people staying in the unit.  We highly recommend staying here, especially for big groups.<br/><br/>We marked 4 stars instead of 5 because of issues we consistently had with the availability of hot water.  We were only 5 people in the unit, half the capacity, but only half of us ever got hot water showers on any day.  A minor issue when coming back from a long, sweaty day seeing the sites, but less convenient in the mornings or late at night.<br/><br/>Another thing regarding the apartment- it is incredibly conveniently located! To make the most out of that convenience it’s best to use the Metro.  The Athens metro system is really good, reaching most places you want to go, but for non-seasoned travelers the sheer volume of people using it can be daunting, as well as the constant risk of pick pockets.  We didn’t have any issues, and (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps was spot on with the lines and stops, so I encourage other travelers to make the most of it as well!"

The flat is very clean, spacious, and well located, three stations from the Acropolis. A few Nice restaurants just in the corner. We recomend this place to everybody !!! Thanks to Aristotelis !"
30902346,509796698,2019-08-15,80158498,Dejan,"The apartment is just like on the photos, nice and spacious. Three stations away from Acropolis. However, during our stay it was quite noisy in the rooms that looked at the street so it was not possible to have a good night sleep. The groups of people would  gather in front of the building, making a terrible noise, there was even a fight one evening. There is a metro station Victoria near the apartment, as well as the park, and there were many suspicious groups of people on those places. <br/><br/>The reason of a low grade is a burglary which happened during our stay. Someone broke the door and we were robbed. The value of the jewellery , sunglasses, phone… that were taken was more than 4000 eur. It was a big trauma for us. <br/><br/>Co-Host Sofiana was kind. I would like to thank her for helping us with the police and for helping us to find another apartment in which we stayed that night. Aris returned us most of the money that we paid for the rent, but it was far from sufficient to cover our loss.<br/> For us this was a nightmare."

El departamento está ubicado cerca de una estación del metro que nos permitió llegar a lugares de interés, casi enfrente se tiene una cafetería abierta 24 hrs y abajo una tienda.

30902346,532200559,2019-09-19,197557244,Amy,The place is gorgeous and at a great price. Victoria station is only two minutes away so really convenient. There's a lot of great food places nearby with supermarkets and convenience stores less than 5 minutes walking. The rooms were clean and the kitchen fully stocked with appliances. Overall a great experience!!! Highly would recommend this place. The host is also friendly and communicative when necessary.
30902346,533100623,2019-09-21,6916821,Megan,"This place was so great! Clean, incredibly roomy and perfect for our party of six adults and one child, could have roomed more. Each couple had their own space which can be so nice when you’ve been traveling together. Stylish details and all the things you could need.  <br/><br/>We ended up walking to and from the city center, it’s a little extra walking but we enjoyed the walk the entire way, and especially enjoyed the markets. There was also a great restaurant right across the street from the apartment. Loved our stay here and would highly recommend this spot."

The apartment was exactly as it should be and as seen in the photos. It was also squicky clean, comfy and spacious - great for a group of 6-10. It's also worth mentioning that Aris gave us a lot of travelling advices before our arrival and he was really helpful during our stay. I can definitely recommend this place :)"

One of my friend forgot a ring in the bathroom, Aris's people found it, and mailed it to one of my friends live in Athens. We appreciate that.<br/>It's really a great experience to stay in Aris 's apartment. Thanks."

Specific mention of a restaurant called Sofia which we liked a lot. The host took care of our pick up and drop arrangements and suggested  on location to visit. Unfortunately  the place is booked on my way back.. would have liked to stay there again. All the best to Aris and Sofianna team... you guys take care of your guest well.

We had a lovely time in Athens thanks to Aris’ expert advice on how to see everything Athens has to (Website hidden by Airbnb) apartment is spacious and extremely clean.There were 8 of us and were comfortable with a lot of space. The apartment is perfectly located and next to the metro station-1 min away.Aris even helped us book private transfers and was very quick to respond to our queries. His place was just as it looked in pictures. Would definitely come back and book with him in the future! Thank you!!

30902346,571281415,2019-12-01,308380889,爽,"首先,房子非常整洁､宽敞,东西一应俱全｡房东的朋友接待我们入住,人非常友好,花了很久为我们介绍一些实用细则､周边好吃好玩的地方以及交通方式,离地铁站步行只要两分钟,小超市步行2分钟,大超市步行10分钟左右｡但是,两个缺点,第一,房子所在的区域基本没有本地人,多是移民,是雅典比较混乱的区域｡第二,房屋隔音差,有三个卧室临街,雅典开摩托的人又很多,基本上属于一晚上睡不踏实的状态,我们中有三个老年人,结果可想而知,适逢周六,酒吧的音乐声就像在耳边,半晚没法睡｡"

Our stay was perfect, the flat is big, clean and in a perfect position. If we come again in Athens we will definitely look for this flat again!! Thank you Aris!"
30902346,581200056,2019-12-24,313584993,Charles,"Nice spacious flat, plenty of beds. Nice balcony, kitchen area, and dining room if you decide to cook. Around a 20 minute walk to the historic area which was the only way we choose to get around. Some nice restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the flat. <br/><br/>Inside the flat the only things I would note is with its wood floor it was sometimes a bit noisy when people walked around but not a big deal. The showers were thoroughly explained when we checked in though I would say it took slightly longer (around 30 minutes) then described for hot water, and the amount of hot water really depended on how long you wait, though I think for Greece that’s pretty typical. <br/><br/>The city in the vicinity of the flat was ok, but you should definitely keep your eye out depending on how many people you’re traveling with. I think this is pretty common in many areas of Athens and we never had any issues. <br/><br/>Sofianna who met us for the check in was pleasant and thoroughly answered all our questions, beyond the numerous points of interest she recommended and annotated on a map for us.<br/><br/>I would have no reservations about staying here again if I were to visit Athens."

C'est le premier mot qui me vient en tête.<br/>Nous étions 5 adultes et 3 très jeunes enfants, nous n'avons jamais manqué de place.<br/>Très propre, la climatisation aide en cas de chaleur. <br/>Manque un peu d'équipement dans la cuisine comme un micro ondes...<br/>L'emplacement n'est pas des meilleurs, a la sortie du métro le 1ier jour on se demande un peu ou nous sommes... mais on s'y fait et puis on y reste que la nuit au final. Le métro est juste a coté donc ça ne dérange pas tant que ça.<br/>Aris est au top, de bon conseils et très réactif en cas de problème. Nous pouvons en témoigner. <br/>Merci pour tout !"
30902346,614732670,2020-03-06,112365468,Domi,"Had a nice stay at Aris apartment. Check In was easy and Aris gave us some good tips. There are good opportunities to buy food, coffee or eat out next to the apartment. And the next metro station ie only 5min walk away. Only small downside is maybe the district there the apartment is located. It looks a bit ugly, there are more pretty areas in Athens. But all in all I really can recommend you a stay in there."

30902346,438138802174481669,2021-08-27,3133322,Khatija,"Expérience mitigée...<br/><br/>Aris propose le transfert depuis l'aéroport jusqu'au logement, ce qui est très pratique. Nous avons particulièrement apprécié l'accueil et l'amabilité de notre hôte qui a vraiment pris le temps de nous présenter l'appartement et les règles à respecter. Aris nous a fourni de précieux conseils sur les lieux à visiter dans Athènes, c'était vraiment top ! Je pense que l'accueil est vraiment un point fort pour la location de cet appartement.<br/><br/>Concernant l'appartement en lui-même, la promesse est respectée : chambres spacieuses, et espaces propres. Quelques suggestions tout de même : contrairement à ce qui est indiqué dans l'annonce, le logement ne dispose pas de micro-onde. Dans la cuisine, les ustensiles de cuisson mériteraient d'être renouvelés. Ils ne sont pas dans un très bon état.<br/><br/>Pour les lessives, l'annonce indique bien qu'il n'y a pas de machine à laver. Aris indique très clairement dans son guide où se trouve la laverie la plus proche. Cependant, nous trouvons quand même dommage qu'il n'y ait pas de machine, surtout que l'installation semble exister dans l'appartement, avec l'arrivée et l'évacuation d'eau dans la salle de bain. Quand nous sommes en vacances, nous n'avons pas envie de perdre du temps à nous rendre à la laverie... Ce serait un investissement qui permettrait à ce logement de gagner en qualité pour les futurs locataires.<br/><br/>Quant à l'emplacement, bien que le logement soit proche de la station Victoria, et qu'Aris nous ait prévenus à notre arrivée, nous n'avons pas apprécié le quartier. Beaucoup de migrants sur la place principale avec des manifestations nocturnes jusqu'à 5 heures du matin. Le deuxième soir, nous ne nous sommes pas vraiment sentis en sécurité, avec beaucoup de bruit et d'altercations à l'extérieur. Devoir traverser cette foule tous les jours pour accéder au métro n'a pas été agréable du tout. Nous avons voyagé avec deux jeunes filles et nous ne nous sommes pas sentis en confiance pour qu'elles sortent seules aux abords de l'immeuble pour aller acheter le pain le matin, par exemple. L'emplacement de l'appartement est vraiment le gros point négatif de cette expérience.<br/><br/>Enfin, nous regrettons le manque de flexibilité relatif au check-out. Dès le premier jour, nous avons notifié à Aris que notre vol retour était en fin de journée. Nous avons demandé à bénéficier d'un ""late check-out"", si le logement n'était pas loué à cette date, bien évidemment. Notre objectif était simplement de bénéficier de quelques heures supplémentaires pour stocker nos bagages et pouvoir prendre une douche avant de nous rendre à l'aéroport. Nous avions quand même passé 10 jours à 1500€ dans cet appartement, un petit geste pour quelques heures aurait été fortement apprécié. Il s'agit d'une pratique courante que la plupart des hôtels et loueurs connaissent et appliquent, quand cela est possible.<br/><br/>Malentendu, communication inadaptée ou politique de location trop rigide, nous n'avons pas pu en bénéficier alors que le logement semblait disponible. Une solution a bien été proposée par Aris pour garder nos bagages mais puisque la communication s'était détériorée, nous ne nous sommes pas sentis à l'aise pour poursuivre. Nous avons préféré prendre nos bagages et respecter les conditions de départ. Dommage que le check-out ne soit pas à la hauteur du check-in !<br/><br/>Malgré les nombreuses qualités de l'appartement, l'emplacement et les conditions de sorties font que nous ne recommandons pas cette expérience. Nous sommes un peu déçus."

Aris was super friendly, easy to communicate with, and provided helpful local tips and recommendations. This Airbnb made for an incredible place for my friends and I to stay in Athens.

The metro station is in a walking distance but it may feel longer when you have luggage or are tired. However, there is a bus stop right in front of the building, which makes it so easy to come from Syntagma Square. As a result we used the bus more and it was very convenient for us.

30917034,450355130,2019-05-09,8086786,Carola,Really nice and clean appartment in a great neighbourhood. Walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants. Would love to come again!
30917034,493786572,2019-07-23,174028350,Marcelo,"The apartment was very nice and the pictures, information and descriptions on the app are very precise. <br/><br/>The localization is perfect, (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) mts from a major metro station, walking distance from all kinds of restaurants, mini markets and some of the key attractions in Athens. We are a family of 5 with a few pieces of luggage. Still, we took the metro from the airport and easily walked to the apartment. You’ll rarely need to travel beyond 2 stations to see the main sites. Even being in a low floor and surrounded by tavernas and stores, nothing to complain about noise either. <br/><br/>The apartment was very clean, linen and furniture in very good conditions, well equipped and with plenty of space considering our purpose (we tend to stay out most of the time, had breakfast at the apartment every day of our 4 days stay, but only had dinner once and spend no more than an hour or so there during daytime). <br/><br/>Communication with the host was always very easy and with great responsiveness thru (Hidden by Airbnb) or Airbnb itself. Fresh fruits, coffee capsules, orange juice and water were waiting for us. <br/><br/>A couple of things that prevented the apartment to be perfect: (1) a few minor disfunctional facilities (lack of some barrier to prevent water from the shower to soaking the bathroom, oversized wardrobe with hanging bar extremely high) and (2) a strong and permanent smell of cats’ urine on the kitchen (it doesn’t come from the apartment, but from somewhere in the building or nearby and it it’s more than annoying. We have cats at home for more than 20 years, so I’m confident about what I’m talking about). One of the air conditioners stopped to cool on the 3rd day, but I believe it might be just my lack of hability with its remote control. <br/><br/>Overall great stay, would recommend it and consider to be back in a future trip to Athens."
30917034,519163943,2019-08-28,274919202,Benjamin,"What an incredible stay! They arranged a pick up at the airport for us. The driver was an absolute delight! His wife Natasha is the host of the house. She was waiting to greet us when we arrived. She walked is through the property with all the need to know information and plenty of local tips and advice. She also arranged another ride for our departure. Such and wonderful time, the home is beautiful and the location is absolutely outstanding. Walking distance from anything you will want to do in Athens! Thank you all for making our trip so special!"
30917034,546908769,2019-10-14,260119923,Lucille,We truly enjoyed our stay - location was perfect - in the center of Athene and walking distance to everything you want or need to see in Athene.  The apartment was exceptional - spacious - interior lovely - super clean and quiet.  Everything we needed was on offer.
30917034,569989789,2019-11-28,21124454,Jan,Die Lage der Wohnung ist super - man kann Athen optimal zu Fuß entdecken. Vom Flughafen aus kann man direkt an den Syntagma-Platz fahren und die Wohnung liegt dann direkt um die Ecke. <br/>Die Müllabfuhr fährt quasi jede Nacht und in dem Schlafzimmer zu Straße hinaus ist die Leerung der Tonnen gut zu hören. Ansonsten alles Tip Top und gerne wieder.

As a family of four we found the apartment very suitable with nice spaces, two twin beds for our children and a comfortable double bed for us. 90m2 in total. The elevator was a big plus as we had quite a lot of luggage. Location wise exceptional with easy walking distance to all major sites that allowed us to cover most in 24 hrs. Pagona was very responsive and a great host. Some yummy variety of food options right at the street, from Mexican, Japanese, Chinese in addition to the the local cuisine."

It is so close to everything you need. <br/><br/>On thing that surprised me was how delightfully big and this place was. It is big and spacious. It also has a wonderfully big kitchen. (As opposed to a small kitchenette.) <br/><br/>Thanks so much for a wonderful final week on my Greek trip.

30919449,445871641,2019-04-30,37260025,Michael,"L'hôtel se trouve dans un quartier miteux où drogués et SDF se côtoient. Bien qu'il y ait un commissariat tout proche cela ne rassure en rien sur la fréquentation du quartier.<br/>Concernant la chambre, la douche est si étroite qu'en allumant l'eau on mouille toute la salle de bain. La chasse d'eau n'était pas opérationnel, pression et pommeau de douche dérisoires. Les étagères s'effondre quand on pose un flacon dessus. Nous avons été réveillé  à  8h par une personne qui est entrée dans notre chambre ... Je ne recommande pas. Heureusement que nous sommes restés qu'une nuit. Le seul point positif ce sont les réceptionnistes qui étaient très gentils. <br/>Michaël & Blandine"

30922142,476425024,2019-06-26,23474940,Ioana,"The apartment is in an excellent location, comfortable and with nice decorations. A second bathroom would be a plus but this is Athens’ old centre and the limited space is something the owners cannot change. I also think that the bunk beds are more appropriate for older children rather than toddlers, as well as the entire place, given the many glass elements and sharp edges in the apartment. This is not a bad thing but something to keep in mind if you have younger children in your company. All in all, a very good experience."
30922142,477993371,2019-06-29,118225322,David,"This is a newly remodeled apartment in Plaka.  The location couldn’t have been better.  We were able to walk to everything in just a few minutes.  The  apartment was very comfortable for three people, and the hosts were very responsive.  Check in was easy and the recommendations for things to see and places to eat were great.  We were greeted with a cold, sweet drink, which was perfect after our hot trip.  This is a great place to stay in Athens. We would definitely stay here again"
30922142,490663138,2019-07-19,4935421,Sophie,Perfect location in walking distance to everything. Spacious for a family of 5 and spotlessly clean. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.

Hosts assistant met us at the apartment to help check us in. Gave us a map of the city and took a few minutes to outline a great walking tour of the must-sees as well as give local suggestions of where we should go. Overall a great experience in Athens."
30922142,533264636,2019-09-21,281618528,Chris,"Our first visit to Athens and we loved it. The apartment is in a fantastic position with everything we needed. Close to great restaurants and shopping. Woke up to the beautiful bells of the church nearby. Considering the position, it was quiet and we slept well! We had a family of 5 and it suited us perfectly. Kids loved the mezzanine bed. <br/>We walked to the Acropolis site and home - best position to wander through the narrow streets, explore and absorb the atmosphere. <br/>Thanks for having us."

The apartment was beautiful, clean and renovated and my favorite part was the thoughtful interior design! The neoclassical building was very beautiful with a lovely little balcony.  Check in and check out was a breeze and the host was very responsive and helpful (although we didn’t interact much since we had no issues!). I would definitely recommend this apartment to others and plan on rebooking next time I’m in Athens."

Restaurants, shopping and parking is very close by.  There were three of us, but the flat could have slept four or more comfortably.  Expect to pay for parking as there is very little street parking.  Overall, a very nice and convenient place in Plaka."

30922575,457999120,2019-05-25,893056,Alykhan,Great place which is conveniently located in the center of town and a 10 min walk from most of the places in Athens. We saw all the main sites in Athens without having to use public transport. Plus Anna's place has some nice touches like organizing transport (at own cost) from airport and someone was there to meet us when we arrived and gave us a local's perspective on places to visit and eat while in Athens.

The host was very kind and provided us with some fruits and bottled water and also had the table set before we came, moreover he answered very quickly to all of our messages.

30924926,638350015,2020-07-15,33367064,Jeanne,"It's my annual tradition to spend my birthday in a different country each year. This year, I picked Greece and chose to stay at Angelos' place and I couldn't have made a better decision! The apartment is quite vintage/retro with equally vintage decorations. It's close to the Agios Nikolaos station (about a 5-minute walk if you know where you're going) and it takes just 10 minutes by subway to get to the center (Monastiraki) and just a few minutes more to the Acropolis. Basically, it's close to practically everywhere you'd need to go while visiting Athens. The shops nearby are lovely as are the people who work there. Oh, and there's a lovely old man who's a neighbor. AC in the bedroom worked well, which was a godsend in the Athenian summer heat, and all the other amenities were great. Angelos and his family also made my birthday vacation very special and I'm so happy I met them! I would stay here again in a heartbeat when I come back to run a marathon from Marathon to Athens if it's available. :) Ευχαριστώ πολύ!"

30924926,722936134,2021-01-09,31576318,Nica,"Angelos place was a great choice of stay in Athens. <br/>In a residential neighbourhood, 1min from a big supermarket you get a really local feeling of Athens. <br/>The flat was bigger that it looks on the photos, with all necessary amenities (including washing machine and fast WIFI). I had to do some online work during my trip so Angelos made sure that I had a work space with an office chair and checked the speed of the WiFi ahead of time. <br/>Flat had a boiler that heated up within 15min and the shower was good. <br/>Angelos was extremely generous with his advises on what to see in Athens/local tips. As I have arrived on NY eve, Angelos even left me some tasty treats as a welcome surprise which ere delicious! The communication was always fast and clear and he had met me at the apartment when I arrived. <br/>Thank you very much!"

30924926,419237027850191737,2021-08-01,103313132,Rudolf,"The major advantage is location of the appartment. Neighbourhod perhaps isn't representative, but Metro station (Agios Nicholaos) is very near and easy to access. From there it's easy to arrive to any place in centre of Athens.<br/><br/>The appartment itself is nicely decorated with excellently preserved sort of antique furniture. It's situated on the first floor, and there's an elevator in the building. Both Wi-Fi and A/C work without any issues. In the kitchen there are basic ammenities (salt, coffee, sugar...). The adress is easy to find and to navigate to by car. During our stay there was a plenty place to park on the street, but there is a parking garage opposite of the building. First two hours cost 5 € and then the price is 50 c for each additional hour.<br/><br/>Angelos was an excellent host. He quickly answered any message (no matter what part of the day) and gave us lots of useful advice what to do or see on Athens or how to get there. Also, he was very flexible with check-in and check-out hours. <br/><br/>All in all it's an excellent place for a couple or a smaller family, suitable for a comfortable stay."

30926888,479648682,2019-07-01,132527108,Christina,"Check in instructions are lengthy, they email you quite often and if you submit a question you receive an auto response that doesn't answer your question, and when they do respond, they refer you to the rental handbook they initially emailed you.  I'm a solo traveler exploring Europe for 3 weeks and this was my only complicated stay that caused me anxiety and it was only for one night.  Keep in mind that you share one bathroom for 3-4 AirB&B rooms in one apartment, no way to know how to plan your morning and you don't know who you're staying with.  Beyond that, the room was clean, sign on the bedroom door with the guests name is a nice touch.  All in all, if you have the time and energy to read the owners manual and 20 emails leading up to your arrival, the price point is great for the location."

30927341,412688615,2019-02-16,7194911,Yunn-Ling,Very clear instructions of the check in process. Great effort to make the apartment cozy & comfortable. <br/>There were some noise issues - (1) ongoing construction is occurring next to the building; (2) you can hear people walking upstairs & at times quite loud.<br/>The common corridor outside the apartment is fairly dark as there is not sensor lights.<br/>The host responded enquiries very promptly.
30927341,414626977,2019-02-20,121342545,Jéssica,"I higly recomend this place. 3 min from the acroplolis subway and reeeeally close to the acropolis itself. you can explore the city by foot. there is restaurants and coffe shops really close. <br/>the room is amazing. clean, lovely mas warm. the host is always answers any questions really fast. <br/>when I came back to athens, I will definitally stay there again."

I was also impressed by the communication and the organising of Tia, nothing could go wrong! The process of checking in and out was super smooth. <br/><br/>The actual apartment was just very dark, which would be annoying if i was staying for a longer period. The cleanness could also be better in the common areas, though i understand that there are other people staying in the house.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend it for the price!"

30927588,419517971,2019-03-04,178020042,Constança,The room I was in was great. It looked exactly as in the pictures and that was the reason why chosed it in the first place. All the logistics of having your own privacy while sharing bathroom and kitchen with other guests works perfectly and I had a great time in Athens. Short walk from the Acropolis and right in the city center.

Check-In Infos are very good and easy to get into the apartment. Its a shared apartment though and it depends with who else you are sharing it - there are clear rules but not everybody has the same attitude to leave things clean behind the way it was before. Its a great place for a very fair price! And the bed is very comfy!"

30927588,478742365,2019-06-30,9781600,Sharon,"Though I never met them, Tia and Mike responded quickly whenever I had any questions. Their clear instructions for check in and notes throughout the house helped everything go smoothly. Just a note: you will share a single bathroom and kitchen area with all of the other guests (total of 3 rooms, so up to 6 people in the house at a time). This wasn’t a problem for me as I was out exploring the city most of the time. Many of the sights are within walking distance, and though the apartment faces a busy street, I could hardly hear any noise. I would definitely stay here again."

Suuuuuper close to all the sightseeing and metro station in case you want to hop to anything that is far. Only one bathroom for 3 rooms, but was not a problem with other guests. Washer on site is helpful, but remember - no dryer. So plan to have a couple of days for things to air dry or go to a laundromat. Would stay here again anytime!"

I've stayed at 3 AirBNBs in Athens before... and this one is the BEST! <br/>Tia and Mike are AMAZING hosts! They are so fast at responding and they give thorough instructions. I was in a crisis where I did not have accomadations for 2 nights. I panicked and searched at different AirBNBs, last minute, and I found Tia and Mike. They responded immediately to me, within seconds. <br/>The room is better in real life than the pictures. It is very modern compared to most AirBNBs. It is a perfect location and is very cozy for those days you're exhausted. <br/>Thank you, thank you, thank you guys! I wish I could give you a 10000 star rating!"

Tia was lovely and great at answering quickly! The only thing you be you have to bear in mind is the hot water switch, which takes 20 min for the water to heat, so plan your showers!

30946867,385238564532923933,2021-06-15,19101738,Danielle,The apartment was very clean & Loukas was very communicable. He was able to assist with a car service for arrival & departure. The views of the Parthenon is breathtaking. Big balcony to gaze at the view all day and all night. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
30946867,391053993318006556,2021-06-23,136198369,Rael,"The place was good, we loved the location near to Plaka and 20 min on foot to the Acropolis, the view of the Acropolis was Amazing as well, we  had a nice stay thanks you"
30946867,404741038321171955,2021-07-12,81846116,Helena,"I cannot recommend this apartment enough if you really want to take in Athens. The location is excellent, the view from the terrace is phenomenal and the hosts were super communicative and welcoming. A must if you are visiting Athens! We will definitely be staying here on our next visit!"
30946867,421432981475300469,2021-08-04,109905039,Juan Antonio,"Incredible accommodation, exceeded our expectations. The views were amazing. We would repeat in this same accommodation."
30946867,428654229469393837,2021-08-14,179853229,Felix,"Nice apartment near all the restaurants in Athens. Good balcony, air conditioner, hot water, nice view of the Acropolis and it has a kitchenette. The host was very communicative and arranged for transportation from the airport to the apartment."
30946867,439548933238346048,2021-08-29,7770325,Rob,"I have stayed in the same area before and this place was cheaper AND nicer than other places nearby. The layout is very nice, the private balcony with a view is spectacular, and the location is perfect. Would definitely stay here again. They also organized a pick-up for us from the port."
30946867,445390928380331547,2021-09-06,101524792,Josh,"If you want a beautiful unobstructed view of the Acropolis while also being close to shopping and restaurants, this is the place! And if you're looking for more than just a view from the distance, the Acropolis is deceivingly close. Only a 10/15 minute walk! Aside from the space itself, the host is very kind and even makes taxi arrangements for you if needed during your stay. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in the city of Athens for this price and view. Great choice for our honeymoon."

30946867,454089243305795980,2021-09-18,153186065,Marcus,"What an amazing location! All the basic necessities in the center of it everything you’ll want to see. It can be overwhelming at times to plan a trip overseas, but they made it so easy. They scheduled my pick ups and drop offs from the airport which took so much stress out of the trip. Thank you!"
30946867,456972619755887642,2021-09-22,93758303,Jordan,"The actual room was clean, but it was extremely hard to find because it was tucked away almost behind a restaurant off the main road. To get to the room, you either had to take a tiny elevator that can hold two people or walk up six flights of stairs with no lights. Our host asked us to let him know when we got on the train so he could let us in. I let him know when we were at the station since I needed WiFi to be able to contact him and he still wasn’t at the Airbnb when we got there. The bed was super hard and uncomfortable to the point you could feel the springs in the mattress. The bug chair on the balcony is also broken. If you move the cushion, you can see where the weaving is busted on the side and not safe to sit in. <br/><br/>Some positives: There was some information about places and restaurants near us which could be helpful. It was also not too far of a walk from the train station. You literally just go straight from the syntagma stop and turn right. It’s right around the corner from inter sport (an easy landmark to find!) <br/><br/>Bottom line: while it wasn’t awful, I wouldn’t stay there again"
30946867,459160210791192860,2021-09-25,242549139,Kim,"Great location, close to everything and perfect view of the acropolis from the balcony!"
30946867,463548354925769472,2021-10-01,23503615,Chris,"Pros: great location, very walkable, worth renting for the balcony view. Cons: the shower leaked a bit and the mattress wasn't all that comfortable. Overall: if you're looking for a convenient place to stay while you're visiting Athens, it gets the job done."
30946867,467855328478600443,2021-10-07,32355709,Waithera,"Was an absolutely stunning studio. Location was amazing and the views… doesn’t get better. Hosts were very accommodating. Only con for me was  having to wait 20-40min for hot water when showering :/ And hot water turning cold if showering past 20min. <br/>Otherwise, I’d recommend"
30970607,360928053,2018-12-22,199691663,Hatem,"Wow ! Totally gem ! Ideally located in the heart of the city, exactly ?bellow?

30970607,401623519,2019-01-15,48447057,Annie,"We had a wonderful stay in Stella and Nikos' gorgeous apartment in its amazing location. It is right next door to the Acropolis metro station and therefore basically at the base of the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum. Nikos met us even though it was late, so check-in was a breeze. There is a lift to make luggage easy. It's a lovely neighbourhood with many restaurants and charming small streets. We did a great free walking tour from the nearby Hadrons Arch. The apartment itself is funky and spacious, plenty of room for our family of six. The beds are comfortable and the apartment cosy even on the coldest winters days, also has airconditioners for the warmer months. The washer/dryer, coffee pod machine and huge TV are great additions. We had no concerns but Stella and Nikos kept in touch in case there was anything we needed, nothing seemed like too much trouble. We would highly recommend this apartment for a great value stay in central Athens and would definitely stay again if we return, which we intend to as we loved Athens and there's so much more to explore."

Οι Στέλλα και ο Νίκος μας εξυπηρέτησαν από την πρώτη στιγμή της κράτησης. Μας έδωσαν σαφείς οδηγίες για την τοποθεσία, ήταν άκρως φιλικοί και απαντούσαν άμεσα σε κάθε αίτημα - μήνυμα και μετά την άφιξη μας. Value for money που λένε και οι Αμερικάνοι!"
30970607,414650256,2019-02-20,68217834,Iain,"Fantastic location near the museum and Acropolis. Lovely bright, spotlessly clean apartment which was very well equipped. Quiet too for central location. Host was fantastic. Perfect stay. Highly recommended. Good value."
30970607,418496420,2019-03-02,24801363,Rene,"Prachtig en ruim, licht appartement tegenover het Akropolis museum. <br/>Modern, nieuw, goede bedden en een zeer complete keuken. Er is ook een balkon. Van velen hoorden we dat het moooiste, rustigste, veiligste en meest centrale plek is in Athene. En dat klopt. Op 15 meter van de metro Akropolis. Je loopt in 6 minuten naar de Plaka en in 13 minuten naar Monasteraki. Zodra in de ochtend op straat zie je de Akropolis in de zon. Het internet is prima, van onze dochter hoorden we geen klachten.<br/>Stella was steeds goed benaderbaar, vroeg naar ons welzijn en gaf gevraagd en ongevraagd tips. De taxi chauffeur die ze voor ons regelde van en naar het vliegveld was ook prima en hij was zeer behulpzaam. Op de autovrije “strip” voor het appartement zitten 5 goede restaurants naast elkaar. Wordt al de schoonheid en de toeristen in de buurt je te veel, wandel dan even een paar honderd meter naar het zuiden, de wijk Koykaki. In deze lower middle class wijk is alles meer down to earth en ook wat goedkoper. Aan de Drakou wat eenvoudige eet en koffiezaken."

30970607,423129182,2019-03-13,38914091,Katherine,"This is an absolutely beautiful apartment, and the location is perfect. You couldn’t possibly get any closer to all the local attractions than this. Not only is there a balcony but there’s also access to the roof with an outstanding view of the acropolis. It’s amazing.<br/><br/> Communication with Stella was prompt and she was extremely helpful. She arranged transportation to and from the airport, suggested the best places to dine, sites to see, and gave us warning about a bank holiday and stuff going on in and around the area. I’ve never had a more conscientious host, thank you so much Stella."
30970607,424789471,2019-03-17,36348166,Jaime,"Perfect location in front of acropolis, many restaurants and bars around but not noisy at all so no problem for sleeping, the apartment is outstanding very modern all clean nice and very cool. Worth value for money, would definitely go back. Easy walk to all monuments."
30970607,427696045,2019-03-24,150732415,Rachel,This is a beautiful place in a convenient location to many good restaurants. It is a quick walk to lots of the best site seeing. Stella and Nikkos are excellent hosts. The apartment is very clean with updated features. The roof top is a wonderful bonus with lovely views.

The location of the apartment is exactly where you need to be as a tourist. The location is safe, close to many different historical sites, and fun markets! Stella was great about recommending restaurants and bars to compliment our visit. Super affordable and clean! 10/10"

30970607,443131516,2019-04-25,857566,Heike,"Die Unterkunft von Stella und Nikos ist genauso wie beschrieben, eigentlich sogar besser. 1A-Lage, fußläufig zu Restaurants, Geschäften und Sehenswürdigkeiten, außerdem gegenüber einer U-Bahn-Station und daher auch für schon müde Füße geeignet. Trotzdem absolut ruhig, sowohl von den Nachbarn, als auch vom Verkehr ist nichts zu hören. Die Ausstattung lässt keine Wünsche offen, die Sauberkeit ebensowenig."

30970607,454987246,2019-05-19,98967541,Morgan,"Stella and Nikos’s place is amazing! So clean and well appointed. Stella was super responsive to all communication and went out of her way to make sure we had everything that we needed. The location is truly spectacular, so close to the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum, and most other sites within a 15 min walk. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks Stella and Nikos!"
30970607,456629199,2019-05-22,221810205,Ruvi,This apartment is just stunning. The bustling streets of Athina right on your front doorstep. It is exceptionally clean and exactly what is depicted on the photos. The instructions are clear and the hosts so amazing. I had no issues with communication or organising transport to and from the apartment. We even had some welcome Ouzo waiting for us on arrival. I would recommend this place and honestly the price is a steal given it's location and accessibility to all the hot spots in Athens! Would give more than 5 stars if I could
30970607,457962766,2019-05-25,87744606,Diana,"Stella and Niko’s house was so lovely and in a wonderful location. The apartment was well decorated and had lots of space.

30970607,461680460,2019-06-01,9248468,Jenna,"Lovely apartment just across from the Acropolis. It is on the 4th floor, but the building does have a 2 person elevator. The space was huge and air conditioning was plentiful. The wifi was super reliable. The apartment was very high end  - stainless steel appliances in the kitchen, large HD tv in the living room, rain shower in the bathroom. This truly felt like an apartment I would live in."
30970607,464693747,2019-06-06,210851179,Diana,"Great apartment right in the heart of central Athens! Around the corner from the entrance to the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum at the start of the Plaka - walkability score . The set up of a queen bedroom and a room with two twins was ideal for our family of 4.  Stella and Nikos couldn’t have been better hosts setting pick ups from and to the airport, suggesting amazing restaurants, and communicating with us promptly at every request. Loved this place!"
30970607,466304551,2019-06-09,86110658,Anton,"Super location minutes away from Akropolis and the house is clean and has everything you need ^^The host ist very friendly, ordered taxis for us and gave us great tips about travelling in Athens"
30970607,471181973,2019-06-17,7958681,Margot,"This was our second time staying at Stella and Niko’s apartment, and it was just wonderful! This apartment in particular is in a location that can’t be beat and Stella went above and beyond to make sure we had a good stay. We have a nearly three year old daughter and since they have a daughter a little older than ours they left us some of her things such as a stroller and some toys and even brought extra things for her during our stay. We will stay with them again and again! Also the apartment is spotless and convenient to everything. Highly recommend!"
30970607,476926647,2019-06-27,177668604,Marie-Christine,Perfect Location! No car needed!<br/>2 steps to museums and Acropolis. Loved the place and the fact that it was really quiet on our terrasse. Confortable for a group of 6.

30970607,482240081,2019-07-06,25772899,Danny,"Stella and Nikos were great hosts. Extremely fast communication, easy check-in process, assisted us in arranging a transfer even when our flight arrived at 1am. The apartment had aircon in all rooms which was great during summer. Right next to Acropolis metro and 2 min walk to the smaller entrance of the Acropolis (great if you buy your ticket online to skip the queue)."
30970607,487434768,2019-07-14,45709812,Allison,Stella and Nikos’ place is in such a great location.  Our family of 6 fitted happily in the apartment which had everything we needed and was very clean. The complementary home made ouzo was especially delicious. We could sit on the roof and watch the sun set over the Acropolis and enjoy all of Plaka at our doorstep. Our family loved Athens and hope to return.
30970607,490176079,2019-07-18,252771205,Ana,"El dpto es excelente igual que su ubicación pero es para 4 personas, máximo 2 chicos chiquitos más"

30970607,506810901,2019-08-11,18741530,Ramy,"I honestly don’t know from where to start. I had an amazing time staying at Stella & Niko’s place.<br/>It was so easy to get to the place and everything is close. [Acropolis is literally in front of the building], a lot of restaurants are downstairs [Filled my belly properly :)].<br/>Walking distance from the center, I’ve managed to see the whole center just walking a few minutes from the apartment.<br/>The tidiness of the place was out of this world. <br/>In fact when I first landed I went straight to the place and stayed there for an hour and a half before going out again and I actually felt like home right away. <br/>I would recommend this place to every single person I know and I would def stay again at this place the next time I’m in Athens."
30970607,508067489,2019-08-12,90345303,Danai,Fab apartment.  Lock is a bit tricky so ask host to show you before they leave.

30970607,519668901,2019-08-29,247062750,Rachel,"Stella and Nikos’s Place was perfect for our stay in Athens. Located at the foot of the Acropolis this apartment has easy walking access to major sites, shopping, restaurants  and transport.  The apartment is spacious and spotlessly clean.  The view of the Acropolis and Athens  from the rooftop is incredible.  Stella was very helpful in coordinating airport and port transfers and in responding to any queries we had.  We loved our stay here and can’t recommend it highly enough."
30970607,521539392,2019-09-01,41168728,Melissa,"Three of us had a  wonderful first time in Athens with many thanks to Stella and Nikos. They arranged a driver for our pickup and drop off at the airport which went seamlessly. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and quiet. Very central location with wonderful sights and great food along our many casual strolls during our 3- night stay. Stella was quick to respond and very easy to communicate with.  We would recommend her apartment for your stay. x"
30970607,524545086,2019-09-06,76036553,Tiajana,"Loved staying at Stella and Nikos’s place! Location was perfect, everything was within walking distance. The place is extremely clean and better than I expected! My checkin process was quick and efficient. Taxi service was arranged for my friends and I, to and from the airport upon request and I couldn’t be more thankful. Truly an amazing experience from beginning to end. The only issue was opening the front door to the apartment but Nikos gave a heads up and we were able to figure it out :)"
30970607,525017289,2019-09-07,20367111,Bretton,"Absolutely the most perfect location in all of Athens. So extremely close to everything you want to see from the Acropolis to Agoura and lots of food options right outside the door. I would recommend that they arrange the taxi service, and be sure to mention how much luggage you will likely have. Most taxis in Athens are sedans, and might not be about to handle 4 people with individual luggage each. I will definitely recommend them to anyone traveling there. Much thanks Stella!! You're the best!!!<br/>Brett"

30970607,531654287,2019-09-18,125178088,Robert,This is an excellent apartment with a great location! The house is nicely designed. It is a bright and clean space. Stella was a great host and the apartment was a great place for our children to hang out and play when were not out exploring Athens. The entrance to the Acropolis is a 3 minute walk away and all other amenties outside your door. The apartment is quiet because it is on the 4th floor with an elevator. We would definitely stay here again in the future

From the time I booked, a few days before getting there to checking in and leaving she was in communication with us letting us know all the things we can do and features of her place. She even helped us out when someone in our party forgot something. I really was happy to stay at this location and talk with Stella. The only downside was the beds and pillows weren't great, but everything else was perfect!<br/><br/>Thanks again Stella!"

Though just a short trip, we made the most of it and enjoyed the hospitality (and the homemade ouzo). The place was very clean and had everything we could have needed! The rooftop was spectacular and we enjoyed the views very much! The street felt safe and welcome! We appreciate all of Stella’s taxi accommodations as it took a lot of stress of our hands. We had a wonderful stay and it made our honeymoon one to remember!"

The kitchen was well equiped and the whole appartment very stylish, also the whole appartment was clean. We felt very welcome and could visit anytime again!"
30970607,555818645,2019-10-28,116117523,Michael,"This apartment is wonderfully positioned in Plaka opposite the Acropolis museum. Plaka is a very vibrant, interesting and safe neighbourhood. Many bars and restaurants are all within east reach yet it is not too close for it to be noisy. Many historical monuments are also within easy walk.<br/>The apartment itself is spacious, clean and great value. Stella is a very friendly, thoughtful hostess who organised taxis for us and was very quick to respond to any questions. To be honest, we found that virtually all of the Greek people were extremely welcoming and I would recommend boththis apartment and Athens in general"
30970607,557506553,2019-11-01,68964923,Elisabeth,"Par quoi commencer ? Tout est parfait ! L'accueil, l'anticipation de Stella pour prévenir vos questions, le quartier (pile ""au milieu de l'hyper centre"" !) génial à 1 minute de l'Acropole et tout près des hauteurs de Plaka ; l'appartement en lui-même  : une pépite au calme, très confortable et avec une vue unique sur l'Acropole ; Stella encore qui s'occupe de vous trouver un taxi pour le départ à 3h 30 du matin ; l'ouzo en guise de bienvenue ... et j'en oublie ! Vous qui lisez, vous n'avez pas encore réservé? Dépêchez-vous ! Un autre bienheureux pourrait prendre votre place !"

We went Athens for the marathon and location is very convenient, 500 m walking from the departing buses that took us to Marathon start line.  And less than 1 km from the finish line.  We had a great time in Stella’s place. The apartment looks just as the pictures."

The location could not be better, as it is within a 10-15 walk to all of the must see attractions as well as the bars and restaurants. There is a cafe literally next door that was perfect for breakfast an quick snacks. The balcony was a great addition that we took advantage of while having a glass of wine after a long day of sightseeing. Would highly recommend."

The  location of the apartment was perfect.  Steps away from the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum. All the sites were within walking distance with many great restaurants just outside their door.   We had a wonderful visit and would not hesitate to stay here again.  They even arranged pick-up & drop-off transportation from the airport.  Fabulous hosts!

They got us english books for the quarantine and a computer so that i could do home office. <br/>The apt is in the best location, in front of the Acropolis station, you can see the Partenon from the rooftop of the building. Lovely view and lovely apt, just like in the photos. Everything clean and very well equipped.<br/>Would definitly recommend!"

L'appartement est vaste, très agréable, belle décoration et parfaitement équipé. Excellente literie, propreté irréprochable et un emplacement idéal, au coeur d'Athènes tout en étant au calme, on ne peut faire mieux. Stella et Nikos sont d'une grande gentillesse, très réactifs, et toujours disposés à aider et à donner de bons conseils. N'hésitez pas à louer chez eux, vous ne serez pas déçus ! <br/>Stella and Nikos' apartment deserves the praise of the other reviews. The apartment is large, very pleasant, beautifully decorated and fully equipped. Excellent bedding, impeccable cleanliness and an ideal location, in the heart of Athens while being quiet, it could not be better. Stella and Nikos are very kind, very responsive, and always ready to help and give good advice. Do not hesitate to rent from them, you will not be disappointed !"
30970607,643862341,2020-07-29,39991932,Annika,"The space was great, very clean with enough room to sit and relax after a long day and smack in the centre of Athens. From the flat you have  easy access everywhere, including if you want to use the metro (clean, efficient) although almost everything is within easy walking distance. The fact there were air conditioners in every room was a huge bonus during the hot days of summer. We were a family of 5 and the space was more than sufficient for us.  Also a lot of added small things that works for families, like the ability to make your own fresh fruit juice in the morning and an easy to use laundry machine in the bathroom. The communication with the hosts worked very efficiently and check-in and check-out was easy. Would clearly recommend this apartment to anyone going to Athens!"
30970607,644512989,2020-07-31,14802669,Mark,"Location, location, location!  The apartment is directly opposite the Acropolis museum and entrance and right in the heart of Plaka and all of the restaurants and bars but is very quiet inside, it doesn't get any better than this!  The apartment itself is modern, clean and comfortable with everything you would need for a stay.   The best part for me was the roof access, the staircase up is not for the faint-hearted but you will be rewarded with panoramic views of the city and the Parthenon, I could (and did!) stay hours up there taking in that view.  Ver reasonable price for the location and excellent communicative hosts, don't look any further, book now!"

This flat is in a perfect position to explore Athens by foot or metro. It is spacious, spotlessly clean and has everything you’d need. Stella is an amazing host -<br/>Answering all questions immediately and doing more than is expected. The beds are comfortable and big. The balcony is good to sit on. There is ac throughout. If you’re adventurous and go onto the roof - there are spectacular views of the Acropolis! Especially at night. The flat is quiet and safe. There is a lift. Stella helped me by arranging a taxi to collect is from the airport and to take us to the port. Everyone was friendly and kind. I would highly recommend this place to stay."

30970607,418605169325458015,2021-07-31,38007805,M,"We had a great stay at Stella and Nikos appartment! <br/><br/>Beautiful and spacious for our family of six. Great location, only a couple of minutes walk from Akropolis side entrance and museum. Kitchen is very well equipped, even including a dishwasher. We appreciated the basic needs that were also provided, such as soap, also for washing machine and dishwasher and other toiletries. Airconditioning was so welcome as there was a heat wave while we were in Athens. <br/><br/>Stella was always very quick in responding to any questions, very helpful in arranging airport transfers and she supported us as a local backup contact when our suitcase went missing, for making a delivery appointment at the appartment. Thank you Stella!<br/><br/>I fully recommend this appartment to anyone"
30970607,419948616122303942,2021-08-02,20502920,Sophia,Incredible place to stay and great location . The hosts were extremely accommodating and helpful. Highly recommend staying at Stella and Nikos wonderful apartment .
30970607,426558282896174539,2021-08-11,165617760,Anthony,"This apartment was amazing! It was very spacious and modern. The kitchen was absolutely beautiful, the living room was big and comfortable. It’s location was also 10/10. It is right across from the acropolis metro station. We were able to go anywhere from here, no problem! Inside was very well-kept and clean, the hosts were very helpful and respond within minutes. I would recommend this stay to anyone. 11/10!! Will definitely be coming back."
30970607,440262353222723021,2021-08-30,27168137,Angela,"The location is fabulous, especially when you're in a big group with small children, it is helpful to be close to everything! If you do need to venture outside Plaka, you have the train station directly across the street.  The station is accessible via a pair of escalators, you won't see a huge sign or anything though.  Be aware the elevator is very tiny, if you have a lot of luggage (which I assume could be the case since the apartment is for many people) you'll need a couple of trips up and down.  Stella is a great host!! If you need anything she makes herself available! Even if it's not with this property, I would recommend her as a host any day."
30970607,443195826222493256,2021-09-03,22384333,Alon,"Stella is an amazing host, took care for everythingwe needed, and supported our pleasant stay.<br/>The apartment is in great location, clean spacious and comfortable. <br/>A great start for our Greek vacation. <br/>Thank you Stella !!!"

Super clean and better quality than most Athens Airbnbs! <br/>Stella and Nikos are great hosts with excellent communication and super easy check in!"
30970607,449739314743470873,2021-09-12,11140161,Arnaud,"The best host ever ! La meilleure hôte que l’on puisse rêver d’avoir ! Gentillesse absolue, communication parfaite, accompagnement tout au long du séjour et gentilles attentions ! L’appartement bénéficie d’un emplacement exceptionnel ! Au pied de l’acropole et face aux musses de l’acropole. Commerces et restos à 1mn à pied ! Plaka est un quartier sympa mais surtout collé aux autres quartiers très cool vers la cathédral. L’appartement est aussi très spacieux, lumineux, bien équipé et parfait pour les apéros balcon.  Rien à dire ! Allez y les yeux fermés ! Cerise sur le gâteau Stella vous propos le un taxi aéroport / appartement avec restitution des clefs et donc arrivée autonome. Mille merci Stella et à très vite !"
30970607,450466064033970295,2021-09-13,65128252,Laura,"Fantastic place - very clean and welcoming, and Stella and Nikos were great communicators and very helpful. Their home is lovely and in a great location. It's right across from the Acropolis Museum and above lots of restaurants - the neighborhood is great. Stella and Nikos were not there when we arrived, but welcomed us with snacks and a drink anyway despite our last minute reservation. <br/><br/>Very comfortable and a great value. It is on the 4th floor, but there's an elevator for easy access. Check-in also could have been confusing since we arrived after they had already left, but Stella sent detailed instructions that even included pictures for reference that helped tremendously. She answered all messages in less than ten minutes and arranged taxis for us to and from the airport, as well as researched covid testing sites for us as this was a requirement for our flight home. I cannot say enough good things about this place or these hosts - we will definitely be returning next time we are in Athens!!"

30971578,449234336,2019-05-06,156839628,Ross,"We were booked to stay in Phaedra’s apartment for 6 days and booked for a further 8. <br/><br/>Highly recommend Phaedra’s apartment in Athens. <br/><br/>This apartment has everything. <br/>Large, bright and airy;  one of the best equipped kitchens we have stayed in;  nicely furnished;  central and within walking distance to city and historical sights and Plaka and Monasteriki markets. <br/><br/>The balcony is huge and the view of the Acropolis from the balcony is as depicted. Amazing at night."
30971578,453260444,2019-05-15,156839628,Ross,"Further to review for stay 1st May to 5th May 2019, I would like to add the following:<br/><br/>We extended our booking from 6th May to 15th May so we could use Phaedra’s apartment to visit areas outside Athens.  This worked really well.  We only had to take a small bag with us, knowing our possessions were secure. On our return to the Athens apartment, the apartment had been cleaned, with fresh linen.<br/><br/>As mentioned in earlier review, would highly recommend this apartment."
30971578,455770699,2019-05-20,11386962,Michał,"The apartment is well situated in the city - all the main attraction can be reached on foot. If you want to go to some distant places you can use metro which is only a few minutes from the apartment.  Phaedra's place is very clean, comfortable and decorated with taste. All appliance in the kitchen are new and well maintained. The apartment has a great large terrace from which you can  admire the wonderful view of the Parthenon, especially in the evening."
30971578,461676244,2019-06-01,11964297,Erin,"We (4 adults) had a fantastic time at Phaedra's apartment in Athens. She is a wonderful host - accommodated our late check in and helped immediately when we had a question about the air conditioning. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. The location is perfect - less than 5 minute walk to Metro stop, Acropolis Museum and the wonderful shopping/dining area of Plaka. It is very quiet at night and the large balcony has wonderful views. We would definitely recommend staying at Phaedra's apartment, and if we are ever back in Athens, we will stay there again. Thanks Phaedra for a wonderful vacation! Erin"
30971578,464245381,2019-06-05,33298250,Katherine,"The place is beyond words. The host Phaedra was super nice when greeting us, her apartment decoration and style was a lovely homey feel.  The view is spectacular,  we loved grabbing some food and sitting on the porch. Everything was super comfortable. Very close to Plaka and central to most everything . We never wanted to leave, definitely would love to stay here on my next trip back to Athens."
30971578,472750183,2019-06-20,5264686,Gregory,"Phaedra’s apartment is a calm and cool refuge with an amazing view of the Acropolis and a pretty Greek church. It is very well appointed with everything you need in the kitchen, good air con, and nice layout. Easy access to the metro and great neighborhood.

We had purchased a 5 day pass for the metro that we only used a couple of times since everting we wanted to see was within walking distance.  The apartment also has a nice view of the Acrópolis.  Phaedra was very communicative and responsive.
30971578,502790382,2019-08-05,45399570,Natalie,"The location is amazing - right by a metro stop with easy connections to the airport line and walking distance to the main neighbourhoods.

30971578,536260991,2019-09-26,19169183,Mj,"You will like this even better than you think. I did and I was sure I would love it. The location is unbeatable, you can walk to everything and there are two close Metro stops plus several trolley lines. There are several really great restaurants within a couple of blocks and several more good ones, plus several cafes on a pedestrian mall, a great bakery, and a terrific ice cream shops - all within 2-3 blocks - oh and a good supermarket plus a couple of small markets.  Really an ideal location. The apartment is lovely and the terrace makes it so spacious and gracious. The bedrooms are on either side of the living room, so there's nice privacy if traveling in a group. Nice large kitchen, well appointed. Really a lovely space! I would stay there again."

The only downside for us were the bells from the curch across the street - they start singing at 7-7.30 in the morning. All in all, a great accomodation!"

Il est très bien placé  (moins de 10 min à pieds de l'entrée de l'acropole), nous avons donc  pu y retourner dans l'après-midi midi pour se reposer au frais, profiter de l'immense terrasse et de sa vue sur l'acropole avant de reprendre nos visites.

30971578,425102250128952290,2021-08-09,121244549,Janice,Phaedra’s place was fantastic. She has thought of every little detail her guests might need while they are away and was always available for questions. The apartment is located in a nice and vibrant neighborhood and walking distance to most of the places we wanted to see. One of the highlights of our trip was having dinner at the terrace overlooking the Acropolis.  We are looking forward to our next visit! Efkharisto!
30971578,428026450325561055,2021-08-13,187826961,Joanna,"Such a lovely place to stay and great value for money... although there where a few issues with water at the start, it was sorted pretty quickly... it wasn’t Phaedra’s fault as there was a small issue in the neighbourhood. Walking distance from every thing but also a nice and quite place to stay... neighbour across the street where a-bit strange as they kept shouting at us for sitting in the balcony but they where fairly easy to ignore. Definitely a lovely place to stay"

It’s a decent area too - with bars, restaurants & shops all in walking distance. It’s spacious & well appointed. Best of all is the huge outdoor space (balcony) with its breathtaking view of the Acropolis.  Highly recommended."
30971578,446087362151613510,2021-09-07,169903364,Nayan,"Phaedra's apartment located at a perfect place. Two minutes walk to a sightseeing bus stop and close to Acropolis.

The balcony and with the view as seen on the picture was a perfect place for morning breakfast or evening family get together."

30971578,464218456184276799,2021-10-02,28759401,Jessica,"Wow!  We (a family of two adults and one toddler) had a perfect stay at Phaedra’s place. <br/><br/>The apartment is spacious, sunny, homey, immaculately clean, and well equipped with cooking items, comfortable beds, and plenty of towels.  Also, though I’m usually indifferent to this issue, the shower temperature and water pressure were the best I’ve ever experienced while traveling!  The bathroom has a somewhat low ceiling but this will only bother you if you have an unusually tall traveler in tow (my husband is 2 meters tall). <br/><br/>The veranda and view are unreal - you can even hear concerts when they are happening at the Acropolis!!  The location is great - in a neighborhood where real people live, but with all amenities (coffee, groceries, cafes) and the touristy areas within a few minutes’ walk. <br/><br/>From a family/kids perspective, we were happy with the dark curtains and low bed for naps and nighttime, the safe feeling of the balcony (there is a small lip beyond the railing), the drinkable tap water, the convenient elevator, and the washing machine.  Our daughter also delighted in the “fairy lights” in her bedroom. <br/><br/>Phaedra was a welcoming, responsive, and helpful host. <br/><br/>Stop your search here and book this amazing home!"
30971578,470763648384156816,2021-10-11,261165925,David,"Clean, bright, perfect location.  Phaedra is very responsive and the check in could not have been better. <br/>There is a wonderful burger place right next door and the apartment is near everything you would want to see in Athens."

The kitchen had everything and the nieghborhood full of life, bars and restaurants. Supermarket was in the next building and minimarket by the entrance. This is definitely my place the next time I visit Athens. Not to mention the spacious veranda to enjoy a drink or two."

The apartment was beautiful, especially the balcony - nice and cool after a full day out. The hosts were amazing and offered so many tips, including how to get from the airport to the apartment with step-by-step instructions. They were super quick to respond whenever we needed them. Our stay in Athens was absolutely amazing thanks to these guys! I would recommend to anyone!"
