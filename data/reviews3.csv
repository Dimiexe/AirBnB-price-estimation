21742593,336982785,2018-10-15,74668469,Marios,"Anna 's house was like the photographs and in reality very cozy and comfortable. The communication was prompt and polite. Highly recommend the house. The neighborhood is a bit scary at night and not really for families. The house is very close to museums, the city's center and public transportation."
21742593,360071944,2018-12-19,3038604,Shmuel,"After ten minutes in Anna's charming apartment in the Exarchia, I decided to extend my stay to 9 days, and make it  my home when I arrive in Athens. The apartment  is bright and shining clean , tastefully decorated, equipped with the guest's comfort in mind. The bed is comfortable, the air conditioning is quiet and efficient and I am in love with the neighborhood with its cafés , restaurants , street art and  galleries.Thanks to Anna's recommendation we had one of our best meal ever in a nearby restaurant . Check in was swift and easy  , immediate communication  and generous attitude towards our needs.      Anna is a painter and her wonderful paintings  hanging on the walls make the whole experience feel great   . Hope to come back soon."
21742593,362396466,2018-12-26,230178781,Anna,"Anna is very friendly, polite and hospitable host. The apartment is very comfortable,  well-equipped and quiet.  I sincerely recommend it. An excellent choice to discover and taste real Greece."
21742593,368022498,2019-01-06,24852674,Georgia,"Anna's apartment is located in the heart of Exarcheia, one of the most vibrant neighbourhoods in Athens. You walk out of Anna's flat and you have a wide choice of bars, cosy coffee places and restaurants to explore and enjoy. Every Saturday you profit from an amazing open market (the most well-known in Athens) that is literally located one street above the flat! What is more, once there you find yourself within walking distance from all the main attractions that Athens has to offer--20 mins. walk to Syntagma Sq., Plaka, Psirri e.t.c. <br/>Anna has been a great, and very discreet, host. Although we didn't get the chance to meet her in person, the communication with her has been excellent throughout our stay. Five stars indeed! The flat is like it is shown in the photos and, I would dare say, even a bit better. It is decorated with a touch of ""gusto"" that is rare to be found in other Athenian flats. It is very spacious for a couple and spotlessly clean. It has all the necessary amenities to make one's stay comfortable and one could also cook there.  <br/>We've enjoyed our stay so much that we will definitely rebook there when in Athens! <br/>We strongly recommend Anna's place and we thank her for her hospitality!"
21742593,407176170,2019-02-01,2470139,Ofer,"Anna is a great host and the apartment is superb. This is my second visit here. It is located in the heart of Exarcheia, the most cool neighborhood in Athens. The apartment is excellent for a single or a couple. I will be back!"

21742593,438641961,2019-04-17,28716947,George,"While the apartment is not near the metro,  the taxi to the airport was just €38 during the day.  The apartment is very recently renovated and decorated nicely.  The older plumbing pipes could not be replaced so you have to pay attention to not sending toilet paper or anything else down the pipes.  The neighbors were all very nice, but you will at times hear them through the walls and you have to be careful not to make noises that might disturb them.  I like having access to a washing machine, the apartment had a very nice one.  The Wifi and other amenities all worked fine.  You should research Exarcheia and view images before you go so as to avoid any surprises. <br/><br/> (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
21742593,443998291,2019-04-27,73814828,Amna,"A seriously PERFECT stay with excellent value.

No shortcomings at all, I recommend this place 100%!"
21742593,449690426,2019-05-07,161722647,Rene,"Thank you Anna, for your great hospitality. The apartment is nicely and thoughtfully decorated and well equipped, very clean, with friendly neighbors in the house. A very neat and comfortable home in the heart of Athens, I can definitely recommend (with some caution for single female visitors)."

21751148,246748840,2018-03-26,167460920,Carol,Demi is a great host. He welcomed us and made us feel very comfortable. He gave us recommendations for places to eat around the area. His place is very clean and comfortable. The only thing I really didn't care for is having to turn off the water heater when we left for the day and remembering to turn it back on when we wanted to shower. The hot water wasn't consistant. Other then that it is a great place to stay.
21751148,254533459,2018-04-17,13449017,Tim,"Great place in great location, very helpful host"
21751148,262477705,2018-05-09,181965492,Carolina,"Primero quisiera recomendarlos de entrada y agradecer a Dimi y a su equipo porque son muy atentos, amables y detallistas, sobre todo porque al viajar con una bebé de un año necesitas anticiparte a los peores escenarios y lo demás solo te queda rezar para que todo salga bien. Nuestra llegada fue un poco accidentada en cuanto a que estaba lloviendo y el alojamiento queda a 5 cuadras grandes de la estación de metro Evangelismos, así que llegamos más tarde de lo que habíamos señalado a Dimi y tuvimos que conseguirnos cómo llamarlo. En todo caso él está siempre disponible por (Hidden by Airbnb) y dispuesto a ayudar. Entre paréntesis, es recomendable aprovechar el internet del aeropuerto para avisarle que ya llegaste. Después de eso, Luca nos recibió muy amable y atento a lo que necesitáramos, sin embargo, estaba muy mojado el piso al parecer la lluvia se había colado a través del aire acondicionado por lo que no lo pudimos prender en nuestra estancia. Es importante señalar que el mismo día que nos fuimos llegó el técnico a repararlo por lo que no creo que vuelvan a tener problemas. Ah! Y el citofono no suena dentro del departamento. Fuera de estos percances, está muy bien ubicado cerca de las principales atracciones turísticas, bien equipado para tener todo lo que uno tiene en casa, rica la ducha que para nosotros fue muy importante y muy limpio. <br/>Así que muchas gracias por todo, sigan mejorando!"
21751148,266548537,2018-05-20,12281575,Luminita,"Thank you very much Dimi!!! It was really nice to stay at your studio. With the first occasion  , we'll definitely repeat this experience!!"

21751148,269211431,2018-05-27,20749713,Milena,"Dimi is a wonderful host! He responds to any question really quickly. The apartment was very stylish and comfortable. Since we had a gala dinner close by, we were very happy that there was an iron available, as well as sufficient storage to store our gala clothes. The apartment itself was clean and well taken care of. We could definitely recommend this place!"
21751148,271017219,2018-05-31,30471628,Pei Chi,Dimi's apartment have a strategic location. You can reach the metro within walking distance and it is just 1 station away from the Syntagma Square where most of the tourist attractions are just nearby. You can also find a lot of nice restaurant near Dimi's place. Dimi is very helpful and friendly. Things are well arranged before we started our trip. He is also informative and responsive.
21751148,274371263,2018-06-09,96294862,Wendy,"Great place, clean, has everything you need. Located behind the Hilton, near restaurants and 25 walking distance from the city centre. Dimi is a wonderful host, kind, provides good advice and is punctual on arrival."
21751148,296557924,2018-07-26,70548639,Lenny,"Je recommande sans hésiter ! La décoration est super, le studio est immaculé et assez spacieux, très bien agencé et situé (à 10 min du métro, 1 arrêt de la place Syntagma et 2 arrêts de l’Acropole...), restos et supermarchés dans les environs. La clim est la bienvenue en été, sans compter le RdC pour les bagages."
21751148,349386086,2018-11-17,126283344,Remco,"Mooi appartement, zoals op de foto's. Goede locatie voor congresbezoekers in het Divani hotel. Helaas duurde het een half uur voordat iemand kwam om in te checken, ondanks mijn berichten vooraf."

Her hosting was lovely and she made me feel at home and welcomed me with warmth"
21752881,214510787,2017-11-26,159474036,Kyungmin,위치도 주요 관광지들과 가깝고 주변은 매우 안전했습니다. 근처에 슈퍼마켓이 있어서 장을 보고 요리도 가능합니다. 오모니아 등 비슷한 가격대지만 위험하다고 소문난 동네에 숙소보단 여기를 강력히 추천드립니다!
21752881,215666226,2017-12-01,69404585,Celal,The home of Tamara is very close to Acropolis and metro station. Tamara is very kind and helpful. The room is little bit small but ideal for sleeping only.

21752881,225008241,2018-01-05,30039935,Arletta,"Tamara was a perfect host, very communicative from the first moment I wrote to her before the booking. She was always available when I had questions and gave some really useful tips about restaurants and places to go etc. Her place was really small, as the room I stayed at, but she informed about it in the apartment description and in the private conversation. The location was perfect, in a very cool neighbourhood, with many nice coffee places, bars and restaurants, literally 5 minutes from Acropoli. I needed a place basically just for sleeping, as I was out sightseeing over the day and eating out mostly and Tamara's place was perfect for that!"
21752881,225616100,2018-01-07,22206264,Alejandra,gracias!! perfecto!

<br/>Tamara gave me a lot of help with my trip and did her best to help me.
<br/>The room is all you need, it's very comfortable and cosy!
<br/>The location is great.. a couple of minutes walk  from the metro station ""Syngrou Fix""<br/>Also, there is a supermarket down the street. <br/>Tamara was very flexible with with me..

21752881,231257497,2018-01-31,139779655,Eddy,"I stayed at Tamara's place for a week and I was very pleased with the overall experience. The location is at walking distance from Acropolis, Athens Museum, Metro station, restaurants, bars, clothing stores, and a supermarket. Tamara was very hospitable and informative. I highly recommend this BNB! "
21752881,232209154,2018-02-04,170761898,Elia,Tamara is a nice and very helpful person. The house is very central to metro station and you can easily reach the center in a few minutes. The room was small but perfectly clean. Grazie!
21752881,234283679,2018-02-12,96463753,Hope,"Tamara's place is near the metro and all the main points of interest. Easily a 10 min walk to Akropolis and 15 min walk to most tour pick ups like the Athens Free Tour. She is friendly with great local suggestions and gives you plenty of space to do your thing. Just like having a roommate, you share the kitchen and bathroom. Noise is very minimal and allowed me to work in the evenings. If you want an inexpensive place in a great location, this is a wonderful value. I'd stay here again for sure."
21752881,235261373,2018-02-16,22926815,Petrica,"My 3 nights stay at Tamara was a delight! <br/>She is such a chill, laid-back, nice and easy-going host, that I felt like I was living at one of my friends' place. <br/>She's replied to all of my messages, she's been very welcoming, showing me her place, stating her few common sense rules and telling me a few key things I should know about Athens, which places to go, what to try, directions and so on. Very thoughtful. <br/>Rather small, the room was clean and more than enough for a 3 days city break: double bed, clean sheets, a window to get some fresh air, a mirror and central heating. The same goes for the rest of the place, bath kitchen etc: all clean and functional, nothing to worry about. <br/>The location is great as well, one of the good areas of the city, a 4 min walk to the metro&bus, 12 mins walk to the Acropoles and 15 min walk to the main square of the city, Syntagma. Just great. Plus there's always Uber. <br/>I will definitely come back at her place next time I'm in Athens and I need a place to stay, as she knows how to make you feel welcomed and to have a pleasant stay.<br/>Thanks Tamara!"
21752881,237230758,2018-02-22,171793788,Irmina,"Tamara’s room is small but very cosy! We mustn’t forget about perfect location of her flat - only 10-15 min walk to Acropolis. You have the opportunity to use the kitchen and prepare breakfasts if you want :) What’s more, Tamara is really helpful! Don’t hesitate if you want to ask about pubs, clubs and other tourist’s attractions - she’ll help you with everything to make your stay unforgettable! :) I really recommend her flat! :) Have a nice stay!"

L appartamento è diverso dalle foto dove sembra molto grande e luminoso. Consigliabile solo per soggiorni molto brevi e per persone molto adattabili."

21752881,242031058,2018-03-11,155925556,Samantha,"I travelled to Athens solo and Tamara was very helpful in letting me know how to get into contact with other Canadians. Also, she let me know of some cool places around me and gave me a heads up on some of the monument closing hours (off-season). I loved staying there as it was close to the Acropolis and some really good food options. Thanks again Tamara, I will definitely be coming back to Athens!"

Das Schlafzimmer ist neu eingerichtet, aber leider ohne direktes Tageslicht, es gibt nur ein Fenster zum Lichtschacht, Aber dafür ist das Zimmer unschlagbar günstig. Sehr gute Lage: Akropolis, Altstadt und Innenstadt sind zu Fuß erreichbar. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis ist super! Unbedingt auf den Berg hinter dem Haus gehen, die Aussicht ist toll. Die Vermieterin ist sehr nett, sie ist Reiseleiterin und kann daher sehr gute Tipps geben."
21752881,247911266,2018-03-30,165420960,Brianna,"This room was so nice and close to the center of the city. We never took the metro, everything was within walking distance. Perfect room for 1 or 2 people who want to explore the city. Tamara was extremely friendly and quick with communication. I would definitely stay there again, my boyfriend and I had a lovely time in Athens, and the value of this room can’t be beat."

Everything is within walking distance, I didn’t need to take any transportation during my stay here at Tamara’s house. There are many restaurants near the metro station, there are also lots of cafeteria, bakery and grocery stores around the neighborhood. Tamara is very kind and respects your own space. If you need help, Tamara is more than welcome to give you a lots of great tips/info about Athens. I enjoyed my stay at Tamara’s place."
21752881,257165288,2018-04-25,28562950,Alessio,"Dall'annuncio, la casa sembrava un ottimo compromesso qualità/prezzo, per essere un po' più tranquillo dell'ostello per le ultime due notti ad Atene. <br/>La posizione è buona, sia per il quartiere tranquillo che per i trasporti, è a due passi dalla metro e  dal centro se si vuole camminare. <br/>Tamara sembra molto disponibile e cortese ci accordiamo per il check-in alle 13.00 e per lasciare qualche ora la mia valigia in casa dopo il check-out, giusto fino alle 3 del pomeriggio. <br/><br/>Purtroppo le cose non sono come sembrano; mi contatta poco prima del checkin chiedendomi di arrivare dopo le 13.30 perché era in ritardo con la sistemazione della casa; dovevo soltanto da lasciare la valigia quindi rimaniamo per le ore 13:00. Lei molto gentile mi fa vedere la casa e la camera. <br/>Noto che dalla cucina arriva uno strano odore ed e in bagno c'è una grossa muffa causata da una perdita del tubo di scarico del bagno. <br/><br/>Al mio rientro la sera, trovo qualche goccia di pipi sulla tazza del bagno e l'acqua non tirata. Noto anche che non c'è niente per attaccare la doccia, bisogna tenerla in mano.<br/>La sera successiva intorno alle 22.00 vedo che qualcuno aveva finito la carta igenica (che la mattina era presente), scrivo a Tamara che mi risponde che si era dimenticata di comprarla e che dovevo fare senza, magari facendomi una doccia.... Credendo in uno scherzo le chiedo di dirmi dove era perché ne avevo veramente bisogno; non soltanto non si scusa, ma si arrabbia ed in modo molto scortese mi dice che ne stavo facendo una tragedia gigantesca aggiungendo che non potevo più lasciare la mia valigia in casa fino alle 3 del pomeriggio e che dovevo andarmene entro le 12.00, con la scusa che non aveva le doppie chiavi, nonostante in precedenza non avesse fatto problemi.<br/><br/>La nota positiva è che l'host risponde molto velocemente ai messaggi. <br/><br/>La casa è economica ok, ma la tavoletta sporca con l'acqua non tirata, la muffa in bagno, lo strano odore in cucina,  l'assenza anche dello stretto necessario e soprattutto dei modi di fare nel momento del bisogno ne fanno una casa in cui bisogna adattarsi. <br/>Se volevo continuare ad adattarmi, potevo rimanere in Ostello molto più economico dove avevo passato le notti precedenti."
21752881,258350002,2018-04-29,120432115,Sujeong,The apartment is located in a safe residential area very close to Acropolis and Plaka. It was easy to get to and from the airport by Metro. Grocery store is 1 min away and there are nice local restaurants close by. The room's got a big comfy bed and Tamara was nice and friendly :)

21752881,261788175,2018-05-07,175360520,Sarah,"Tamara’s place was in a perfect location, about a 5-10 minute walk from popular tourist attractions. She was quick to reply, good with helping us find the place, and was okay with late check in which were all great things. She recommended a good walking tour for us to take. She was rarely there so the room was quick and felt like we had the place to ourselves. The only downsides of the place were that the neighbours were loud, and the kitchen wasn’t stocked with many dishes to use. The ones that were there were dirty so we had to clean them when we wanted to use them. Overall the experience was good and we would recommend Tamara as a host."
21752881,262818253,2018-05-10,27985175,Zafirah,"Tamara's space is wonderful and she herself is friendly, funny and very helpful! Staying at her apartment was like staying at a friend's place because it's so warm and inviting. Communication was easy and Tamara was very personable. <br/>It's close to everything and the location is convenient, especially with the supermarket that's just downstairs. My only regret is that I only spent 2 days there. I was travelling alone and staying at her place did not make me feel stressed at all."
21752881,265137119,2018-05-16,26302272,Grit,Tamara was very welcoming and super friendly. Wish we would've stayed longer to enjoy Athens and followed more of her tips. We had a very good time in her appartment that offered everything needed. Would come again for sure :)

21752881,271402597,2018-06-01,90387549,Adi,"I had a very nice stay.<br/>The room is very small so it’s basically suitable only for sleeping.<br/>There is no window towards outside so the air wasn’t so fresh, but it didn’t disturb me that much.<br/>The bed is super comfortable, the room was clean and the location of the apartment is perfect.<br/>Better for short stays or for people who plan to be outside most of their stay."
21752881,272274879,2018-06-03,35298025,Amanda,Tamara was extremely accommodating when I checked in late due to a flight delay and her apartment is really clean and cosy! Not to mention really near Acropolis area and several supermarkets so getting around was really convenient

En revanche, il y a des choses à améliorer: comme avoir un vrai linge de lit, avoir le savon et shampoing disponible.<br/>Et j'aurais aimé un peu plus de convivialité de la part de l'hôte, c'est tout de même ce qu'on attend quand on fait du airbnb partagé.<br/>"

21752881,284759577,2018-07-02,84889705,Ana Paula,"Our stay at Tamara's was ok. I travelled with my boyfriend and even though we found the room a little bit small for two people, we were ok and the room was very pretty. The location is amazing, 10 minutes walk from the Acropolis, very close to a variety of restaurants and close tp other services like a laundry, pharmacy, tourism offices and supermarkets. Busses and a metro station were also very close by. We didn't meet Tamara in person but she answered very fast all of our texts and her boyfriend Theo received us and had a great disposition to help with any issue.  WE LOVED THE LOCATION"

I contacted Tamara and she told me how to fix it. It was just very inconvenient and I wish we knew beforehand. Also the bed is not very comfortable, we didn't get a good nights sleep. But for the price I think its a good place to stay."

Easy communication, great hosting and if you don’t mind walking it’s walking distance to all main attactions (Acropolis, Plakas, Monastiraki, Panathinaikos stadium, Lycabettus Hill). Otherwise it’s an easy 2 minutes walk to closest metro and bus.<br/><br/>Strongly recommended!"

21752881,335103440,2018-10-11,119725166,Jan,"We think, that the absence of the window in the room should be mentioned expressively in the description, not at the photo only. It is quite dark and small room without any possibility to ventilate.<br/>Communication with Tamara was excellent and there was no problem with very late check in (1:30a.m.).<br/>The flat Is great located, but it is quite noisy house, because of very thin walls."

As a solo female traveler I felt safe to walk around the area. <br/>Nice hosts. Tamara responded immediately to the messages. Teo left work to come and check me in and came in an extremely short time to fix the bed when I told Tamara that it seemed to be broken. <br/>The room is small and has almost no natural light, which makes it easy to sleep at any time of the day. I only wish it had a lock for a bit of extra privacy. <br/>The wifi connection was stable and fast. <br/>The place is a great option for those who look for a very basic and decent place to crush for a couple of nights in a great location."

21752881,543178510,2019-10-07,99263506,Anita,"NOT a good airbnb experience.  Bed was soft and saggy and I could feel in the springs in the mattress.  Kitchen and bathroom were dirty and were not cleaned during the three days I stayed there.  (I found another place to stay for the fourth night.)  <br/>Even the light switches in the hallway were dirty.  It doesn't take much time to keep a place clean and to invest in a table, extra set of sheets.  (I didn't have a top sheet the first night so had to just use a blanket that God knows how many guests had used.  Tamara's answer when I asked about a sheet was that it had been washed and was drying outside and got rained on.  GET ANOTHER SET OF SHEETS so the host can change between guests and not continually recyle the same set.  On the second night the top sheet was there but was damp.  I would NOT recommend!!!"

Even for a gluten intolerant like me I could find a  Green Shop in my street, also dry cleaning and laundry services as well a supermarket."
21752881,579622724,2019-12-21,57660601,Melissa,"O apartamento é bem localizado, é no primeiro andar e tem elevador. Dá pra fazer tudo à pé e tem um ponto de ônibus na porta pros dias de preguiça. Tamara foi super atenciosa com o check in e me deixou bem a vontade. O apartamento não é super limpo, mas nada absurdo. A cama é realmente bem desconfortável, infelizmente não consegui dormir muito bem. Se isso não for um problema pra vc, recomendo!"
21752881,589577152,2020-01-06,68101483,Yaniv,"Tamara went out of her way to help us, several times and in several ways. She's laid back and fun and made us feel at home. Great location and a nice room made this a great experience for us."
21752881,591945330,2020-01-12,325126358,Mathis,It was a nice place and right in the center of Athen. The room got no windows but for a few days it was perfekt

21752881,605656839,2020-02-15,176809140,Bárbara,"Good: the location is really good, walk distance to a lot of archeological places and 6 minute walk to metro.<br/>In general the house was clean and you can use the kitchen if you want to cook.<br/>Heat works good, i went in winter and I wasn’t cold.<br/>Room has space for your luggage and your clothes, and a mirror.<br/>Wifi works great.<br/>She gives you the keys so you can get to the apartment when you want and is really independent.<br/><br/>Alright: bed was normal<br/>She was nice for most part but the last day when i check out (11am) she was super rude because i woke her up to say goodbye.<br/><br/>Bad: the bathroom wasn’t so clean but more than that is that it was so messy, like her stuff was literally everywhere, dirty clothes in the floor, razor on the shower etc..<br/><br/>I give the place a 8/10 for price/quality and the host it’s alright."
21752881,608302732,2020-02-20,56295026,Nick,Tamara is helpful giving information and always available for any concern. Location is great

21752881,619383251,2020-03-17,339309826,Silvina,"Tamara and Theo are really dedicated hosts, they made our time here nice and easy. They helped us in everything we needed. We recommend them and will come back for sure!"
21752881,631769698,2020-06-24,18211005,Fredy,"Great value for money. My request was really short-termed and Tamara was super kind to let me stay at her home. I loved the surrounding area, especially the nearby walks in the Philopappou forest. Also the metro station and many nice restaurants are just a short walk from the house. I had a great time, thank you Tamara."

21752881,647156394,2020-08-06,142494801,Maé,"Nous avons passé 2 nuits dans cet appartement. Il faut dire que nous étions heureux de trouver un logement bien placé et peu coûteux. Toutefois il ne convient pas si vous souhaitez passer du temps à l’intérieur. Il n’est (quasiment) pas équipée (presque pas de vaisselle, couverts, poubelle non fermée, pas de table à manger), et il n’y a pas de lumière naturelle dans cette chambre ni dans la sdb ni dans la cuisine. <br/>Tamara est très sympathique, donc pour avoir un lit c’est pratique, mais ça ne fait pas tout à fait le travail d’une maison."
21752881,650355336,2020-08-13,48635142,Umair,"Tamara is a very helpful host and super easy to communicate with. The place is inexpensive, in a great location and perfect for a short stay for a solo traveller. Many thanks, Tamara!"
21752881,650928864,2020-08-14,10614077,Fernando,"The flat its in a really good location ! How over the room i reserved its really small and hot , although you have a fan I think won't be enough! Unfortunately I couldn't stay here because when I arrived the bed was broken, when I told the host she assumed I broked wich made me really angry because its when I realized the flat its more a little hostel with people coming and going and she doesn't leave there. The entrance its with a code for keys in locker wich is fine how ever the small room doesn't have key so you leave your things hopping for the best. Finally my host made me a full refound and I could find another place, she also give me advices before arrival and tell me to look up my stuff at the subway."

21752881,664523190,2020-09-15,352500657,Benjamin,Merci pour le séjour
21752881,667991004,2020-09-26,180202966,Angelo,"PROS<br/>Although devoid of charm, Sygrou Fix is a central major transport hub<br/>Relatively inexpensive<br/>Street noise not audible from the room<br/><br/>CONS<br/>And I mean con. Contrary to the description, guests do not share the place with Tamara but with each other in a lock box place. The room has a very noisy sliding door which cannot be locked. To be fair, I was offered a full refund since Tamara would not accept responsibility for theft, but if the descripion was not deceptive, I would never have booked it.<br/>The rubbish bins in both bathroom and kitchen were full on arrival and guests were obliged to pile up the rubbish next to the bins. Highly unsanitary in steamy Athens"
21752881,702010379,2020-10-19,115289666,Hira,"Tamara’s super sweet and the location of the apartment is great! There is also a lock on the door as I read that was a concern in a previous review. The bed was a bit broken & unstable which she warned me about but it was a bit stressful to sleep on because of it & the bedsheet had holes in it. Everything else was nice, definitely decent value for money."
21752881,706373515,2020-11-03,187451541,Nicole,"Tamara fue súper servicial, me ayudó muchísimo para ubicarme en la ciudad y saber que bus y metro tomarme para llegar al alojamiento y moverme por la ciudad. También me aconsejó sobre lugares para ir a comer, estuvo siempre atenta. Gracias."

We hang out together one evening, where she showed me a little around. Although some things didn't work out as planned, I still liked it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there comes no sunlight in the room and it got a little hot in the night, but with the fan and especially for this price, it is more than enough.<br/>Also, it was clean and I definitely recommend it!"

Otherwise, I found the room not very clean, and too small for two persons, though, very good location and very good price."
21752881,450470572075142308,2021-09-13,5143370,Juan,Small but sufficient place right in the hip area of Athens! Tamara was helpful and accommodating.

Nous avons eu du mal à dormir malgré la fatigue. Je pense que le logement est idéal pour un court séjour et si vous arrivez à dormir peu importe le bruit.

21757507,221631567,2017-12-27,23872497,Marios,"The perfect place for 2, either for short or a longer stay in Athens!<br/>The apartment is exactly as it appears in the pictures: space is just right for 2 people; minimal decor with nice touches to make a difference; fully equipped with everything one needs (there’s even a medical kit!); nice terrace with beautiful Acropolis view<br/>The location is perfect: 2-3 min walk from Syntagma square (for those coming from the airport by metro or bus X95); right across from a spacious private parking for those coming by car; walking distance to pretty much everything in central Athens. <br/>Communication with the hosts was also perfect: Instructions for check-in and check-out very clear and to the point; almost instant responses to questions.<br/>Overall: A wonderful stay!"

Die Wohnung war genau wie beschrieben und hat unsere Erwartungen voll erfüllt. Die Wohnung ist sehr gut ausgestattet und ansprechend möbliert. Das Bett war super bequem, das kleine Badezimmer hat unseren Ansprüchen mehr als genügt und auch die Küche war mit allem nötigen ausgestattet und mehr. Die Wohnung war makellos sauber, Handtücher waren ausreichend vorhanden und schön flauschig. Besonders gut gefallen haben uns die perfekte Lage des Appartements & der große Balkon mit Blick auf die Akropolis. Wir waren mit dem Preis-/ Leistungsverhältnis sehr zufrieden und würden die Wohnung jedem empfehlen, der Athen erkunden möchte."
21757507,240590049,2018-03-05,7247847,Marc,"Very central, clean and cosy apartment in the heart of Athens. Everything you need around the corner and within walking distance. View to the Acropolis - just spectacular. Big patio on the top floor. Very quite at night (not the case in most central apartments in the city)."

It’s the perfect place for a nice weekend or longer for 1 or 2 pax. The apartment is super stylish, very cozy, handy and clean. <br/>Nice restaurants, bars & cafes are literally just around the corner or even in the same building.  Love it! <br/>Ps: The bedding is great, 5star hotel style!"
21757507,246317698,2018-03-25,549008,Aaron,"My wife and I stayed for a week at the end of March, great place and great location. You can actually see the Acropolis from the bed! It's a great view to wake up to every morning. The upstreet team was very responsive, and answered all my questions quickly. I'm a fairly light sleeper, but it was quiet at night. About 9 am people start coming to work at the apartment/office next door, but there's another sliding door that divides the bedroom from the entrance door, so that keeps things quiet. The street it's on is a small one-way street, so there's minimal noise/honking from the street. The wifi was good enough for my work conference calls without a problem. The terrace is great for getting some sun, and I ended up working on my laptop a lot outside. There's retractable sun/rain cover. There are many excellent restaurants within short walking distance, and the metro is also not far away. The bed was comfortable. We'd stay there again!"
21757507,247903928,2018-03-30,71975760,Anja,Ein wunderbares kleines Appartement in ausgezeichneter Lage. Die Aussicht ist phantastisch und die Terrasse ein Ruhepol mitten in der Stadt. Super nette kleine Lokale in unmittelbarer Umgebung.

21757507,252840898,2018-04-12,36431411,Bassma,"The apartment was great value for money. The location was the best thing about it. It is within walking distance to all the attractions.  It is also in a quiet street, so it was nice to go back and rest after a long day. It is big enough for a couple , or a maximum of a couple with a baby. <br/><br/>We really enjoyed the very large terrace that had a view of the Acropolis. The apartment was well equipped . We were very impressed with the check in and check out procedures.  Voula was very helpful and communicated often with us. <br/>I would highly recommend this place."

21757507,266514908,2018-05-20,26231880,Tony,"I very much enjoyed the week I spent in Athens staying in this terrific apartment.  The apartment is only a short distance and easy walk from Syntagma station, and check-in was easy with the instructions provided.<br/>It is located on the top floor of the block, and has a wonderful view over central Athens and, of course, the Acropolis.  Fortunately, there is a small lift to assist getting your bags up on arrival.<br/>The apartment was sparkling clean on arrival, with thoughtful touches such as cold water in the fridge and coffee pods for a charge up to get you ready to explore the wonderful nearby area.  There was also a nicely equipped kitchen and bathroom, which also came with a washing machine.<br/>The bed was comfortable, but the highlight was a large balcony which was perfect for a cold beer looking at the view after a hard day of sightseeing!<br/>The apartment is well located, in a reasonably quiet street, but only a short walk to the tourist areas of Plaka and the Acropolis, as well as the Metro and National Gardens, with a number of nice cafes and restaurants nearby.<br/>The hosts were readily available for any assistance, as well as advice on good local restaurants and things to do.<br/>I'd have no hesitation to stay here again if I am lucky enough to come back to Athens."
21757507,269949773,2018-05-28,171494406,Graham,"The apartment is clean, light and airy.  It’s position is perfect for restaurants, shops, archeological sites, museums and public transport; all within walking distance. <br/><br/>The view of the Acropolis from the bedroom is stunning.

21757507,274050270,2018-06-08,158328467,Javi,Muy difícil de mejorar. El apartamento es tal como sale en las fotografías y estaba impecable. Las vistas a la Acrópolis desde la terraza son un recuerdo para toda la vida. 
21757507,275879549,2018-06-12,71531185,Audrey And Nadeem,Great location and great view of the Acropolis. Morning coffee on the terrace is a must!

21757507,277751927,2018-06-17,12705084,Blair,Lovely but small apartment. Amazing to lie in bed a look at the Acropolis. The washing machine is welcome after long travels.
21757507,280333240,2018-06-23,130977883,Dianna,This apartment was beautifully decorated with an awesome balcony that we took advantage of to watch the sunset over the Acropolis.

21757507,285585277,2018-07-04,1310233,Stefanie,We loved this apartment. The place is clean and stylish and the spacious deck with that view of the Parthenon is just a magic spot for a sundowner. The location is ideal and you can easily walk everywhere. There are many bars and restaurants on the doorstep yet the place is still quiet and private. I would highly recommend it. We used the welcome taxi service too and that was also great.

The Apartment was of high standard & dealing with the property management  were FABULOUS, extended our stay for a small fee but if apartment was not available they were able to store our luggage also which was helpful - as our flight was late at night.

21757507,302741295,2018-08-06,16633128,Seine,"L'appartement était très fonctionnel, décoration minimale, mais raffiné et cosi, on s'y sent bien. Il y a une grande terrasse équipée de sièges et bedsits avec vue sur l'Acropole. <br/>L'amplacement est idéal car super central mais dans une rue calme. Les hôtes sont très prévoyants, toute la losistique est anticipée, raison pour laquelle je n'ai pas eu à les contacter durant le séjour.<br/>Je conseille vivement cet appartement. "
21757507,305888666,2018-08-12,6798530,Derya,"Great apartment, cozy, fantastic view to Acropolis. Lovely terrace to chill at night amd watch sunset over Acropolis. Perfect location; nice and quiet home, not straight in the middle of the shops and restaurants but only 5min walk away from the crowd. Hospitality was amazing, quick responses and very friendly team, with local recommendations and airport pick-up etc. Self check-in  was super easy and therefore very flexible. Thank you all!"

21757507,318064294,2018-09-03,34205605,Kozue,"Konstantino's team did a great job with communicating with me before and during the stay. The apartment is conveniently located for sightseeing and dining/drinking. The apartment is small but well-equipped and comes with the spacious deck with an amazing Acropolis view. AC was oddly weak but it was better than nothing. Self-check-in/out was smooth and Konstantino's team sent me a link for the details before my arrival. Only negative note I must mention is that when I checked in in the middle of the night, the kitchen was extremely hot. I found out that one of the electrical range tops was turned on. It was scary and I reported it. Other than that, everything else was great and I would consider his apartment when I visit Athens again. Thanks."
21757507,319361510,2018-09-06,8034605,Ryan,"Excellent, functional apartment in a great location.  Very safe and quiet.  The apartment is very close to multiple Metro stations, numerous restaurants, bars, shops and the main historical sites.  Athens is at your fingertips from this location.  The flat isn't gigantic but very functional and has all that you'd need (including a washing machine).  The large terrace provides great views and a great spot to relax (and even get some sun) after hours hiking around the city - a true plus that you won't find at most places.  Host is incredibly communicative and check in/check out is very simple."
21757507,320733646,2018-09-09,13732404,Carolyn,A wonderful flat in a great location.
21757507,323918216,2018-09-16,145624154,Alice,Best area to stay when visiting Athens. Apartment is very clean and comfortable for a couple. Pillows were very hard though.
21757507,325247313,2018-09-19,21696682,Kevin,"Konstantinos’ apartment was lovely.  Voula was our primary contact and she responded very quickly. The apartment is stylish and clean with a large and lovely patio. The location was excellent, easy walking to everything we wanted to do and see."

21757507,339864847,2018-10-22,2768633,Noa,"Wonderful location! We walked around only by foot to many places, and to the Acropolis as well.

21757507,345859838,2018-11-06,40452818,Thomas,"We had an excellent time in this tastefully decorated, modern, well-equipped and well-maintained studio apartment in the centre of Athens. The place was well equipped for a short stay. The location is brilliant, in close proximity to Syntagma Square. As a result there may be the occasional issue with normal urban noise (including noise from construction work), but in our case it was minor. There are plenty of good-quality shops, supermarkets and restaurants in the vicinity. The communication with the hosts was super professional. Considering the quality of the apartment, its location and the professionalism of the hosts, this was one of the best AirBnB experiences I ever had. I can definitely recommend this place."
21757507,348257671,2018-11-13,15936876,Sarah,Great central location within walking distance of everything. Was ideal for Athens marathon. Nicely furnished with everything you need and of course a great view!
21757507,348785065,2018-11-15,24562923,Clarissa,This space was very comfortable. The view of the Acropolis was stunning. The washer was a God send once I figured out that you needed to latch the drum before it would start. The touch of a drying rack was very much appreciated. <br/><br/>The location could not be beat. Near to everything.  It was very quiet which we definitely would prefer to a party running every night from apartment next door. <br/><br/>Konstantinos was the consummate host.
21757507,351037828,2018-11-21,51237959,Stephen,Place was stunning. Super clean and the view was breathtaking!
21757507,353266999,2018-11-27,151735663,Irina,"This studio apartment is in excellent location and it has stunning views of Acropolis. It is is walking distance to almost everything and it is in a very charming neighborhood. The terrace is really, really nice. Communication with Konstantinos and his team was quick, clear and enjoyable. They are all ready to help and provide necessary information even in the week-end, which is amazing considering that all businesses are closed in Greece on Sunday. A big thank you for having us!"
21757507,360069051,2018-12-19,29790466,Danny,"The appartment is great! The view on Acropolis, right from the bed, is giving a great added value. Very clean. Everything needed is inside and in perfect condition. The host respond immediately. The only thing bothered us was the noise coming from the road construction just beneath the appartment. We were not prepared for a very early wakeup... The location is unbeatable. Thanks to the host, we will definately come back."

21757507,409284945,2019-02-07,18271544,Natasha,We stayed for 4 days here and would stay here again. Everything is clean and well kept & fast communication with Upstreet. Plaka is also a great place to stay & explore the city. We could not enjoy the balcony as much as the building opposite is a building site & a bit noisy in the morning but thats just part of the big & beautiful city of athens!

21757507,420638388,2019-03-07,69332584,Adam,Fantastic apartment in great location with an epic view. Waking up the view of the parthenon was incredible and the balcony area was nearly as big as the apartment.
21757507,423113443,2019-03-13,130355176,Derek & Riah,"Excellent location!  Near metro and walking distance to all the major sights.  Great restaurants nearby and a spectacular view of the Acropolis.  To wake up and go to sleep so close with such a great view is a genuinely unique experience.  Quiet building with a convenient elevator.  We really enjoyed spending time on the balcony.  Very comfortable bed and all the amenities made for a wonderful experience.  Kostas and Konstantino's communication was excellent, checking in with us regularly to make sure we had everything we needed.  Highly recommend this place!  We would definitely stay here again!"

21757507,450039987,2019-05-08,34949177,Jacki,"We loved our stay at this little apartment. The view was amazing and it was the perfect location for exploring Athens on foot or on the metro. Konstantinos and his team were lovely to work with, and we would definitely stay in one of their places in the future!"
21757507,451675186,2019-05-12,73768560,Jaleena,"The balcony... wow! Loved the view. The apartment was perfect for the two of us - super clean and super comfy bed. Communication was very clear and quick - I particularly loved how detailed their check-in instructions were, complete with photos and handy informationfor getting around the city. Would definitely recommend to others."
21757507,453165871,2019-05-15,62536764,Arlen,"This is a great place in awesome location - the patio and view of the Acropolis are what sets this rental apart!  The kitchen and bathroom are very small and might not be ideal for longer stays. The apartment is very compact and efficient - but very clean and well maintained and can’t beat location - steps away from cafes, restaurants and bars. We easily walked to the acropolis from the apartment.  The communication and assistance in check-in, taxis etc was excellent.  Would absolutely stay here again."
21757507,455836467,2019-05-20,64445139,Chance,"Great location, clean, beautiful view, rest check in. Would stay there again!"

21757507,460406926,2019-05-29,2111971,Alex,"An amazingly located spot right in the Plaka, with a fantastic view of the Acropolis. Took the Metro (train) from the airport to Syntegma Square and then only a5 minute walk to the apartment -super convenient.  So close to the best of all the great historical sites in the city, best shopping, and great restaurants but quiet at night.  Very small kitchen and bathroom but decent size bedroom and very comfortable bed.  Excellent communication and local tips were spot on. Would stay there again."
21757507,461184200,2019-05-31,61087651,Landan,"This clean, beautiful space has an amazing view of the Acropolis. The hosts were extremely communicative and helpful. I would definitely recommend this place."
21757507,465086589,2019-06-07,40663906,Tessa,"This apartment is thoughtfully furnished with a spectacular view in a great location for exploring Athens. Kostas who manages the property communicated regularly leading up to our stay and was very prompt responding to my queries, checking in during the stay as well. While it was a little on the small side given we also had a cot for our 9 month baby it would better suit a couple or a single person and I would highly recommend this place. Sitting on the generous sized balcony and watching the sunset on the acropolis was a highlight for us."
21757507,469239683,2019-06-14,236835632,Andrew,"This is the perfect location as a base to explore Athens. It is conveniently located in  walking distance of some of the main sights as well as bars and restaurants and public transport. The view of the Acropolis from the balcony is special and a picture cannot do it justice. Checking in and out is easy and the hosts provide a detailed booklet with a lot of helpful information. The apartment itself has everything you need for the stay and has modern furniture and decor. Overall, I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Athens."
21757507,473251258,2019-06-21,4148514,Gert,"We spent three days in the apartment of Konstantinos which is very central (only 5 minutes to Syntagma),  very stylish furnished, clean and comfortable. The communication and the check-in was more than perfect. The right place to discover Athens and to return in a quiet place with the panoramic terrace. I would choose this apartment the next time in Athens without any doubt."
21757507,474619306,2019-06-23,74867054,Donal,"Really enjoyed our stay. Our apartment was in easy walking distance of the Acropolis,  the Acropolis Museum,  Plaka (restaurants, tavernas), Ermou Street (shopping) and the Parliament Buildings for the changing of the guard. The apartment isn't that big, but had everything we needed for a couple of days in Athens.  It is very well decorated, very clean and the balcony with a clear view of the Acropolis was a bonus. <br/>Konstantinos was a great host. Easy to contact and very prompt with useful information and advice.<br/>Would recommend."
21757507,475980076,2019-06-25,37490533,Abbey,"Lovely apartment in a great location in Athens.

Good AC and WiFi, really nice terrace with great views. Would highly recommend"

21757507,480150210,2019-07-02,266366787,Samara,We loved our stay at Konstantinos' apartment.  The view from the balcony is magnificent.<br/>The apartment was as described and had everything and more that we needed.  The lockbox check-in was fantastic and the location can't be beat!! Thank you Konstantinos for a great stay
21757507,483199312,2019-07-07,38384031,Maggie,"This apartment perfect for a quick stay in Athens! It is in a great location which made it easy to walk to dinner and attractions. The apartment is small, but clean and organized with a nice sized patio looking out at Acropolis."
21757507,485092298,2019-07-10,164301463,Andrea,"This apartment is very clean and stylish.  The balcony, which has a magnificent view of the acropolis is large, with more than enough room for  the table and chairs, and the two chaise lounges.  The bed and pillows are very comfortable.  The location is central, but being on the 6th floor is is above any street noise (although it is not a busy street). The air conditioning works well, even during a heat wave.  The communication is immediate and helpful.  Unlike some places, this apartment is as good as, if not better than the pictures.  I highly recommend it and will stay there again next time we go to Athens."
21757507,486129956,2019-07-12,47878028,Annie,"This one bedroom apartment has everything you need for a short stay in Athens. Styled with a modern touch and an easy walk to Plaka and other local spots of interest. Simple check in process and timely responses from the host. The view from the unexpectedly large balcony is excellent, overlooking the Acropolis hill. Would definitely stay again for convenience and location."
21757507,487416053,2019-07-14,9373592,Karin,Nice apartment with balcony and Wiev of acropolis. In the Middle of everything.
21757507,490683492,2019-07-19,49718806,Nicole,"The apartment is in a perfect location. Everywhere we wanted to go included directions that said to take the metro to Syntagma Square, but we were already there! It could not have been a more central spot to all the sites. The balcony was my favorite. It was cute, had plenty of space for us to dry our cleaned clothes, and had a picturesque view of the Parthenon. The apartment was clean and check in and out were easy."
21757507,493815880,2019-07-23,106314968,Bill,"Good stay, hosts were very responsive, the suggestions were amazing, and the place was spotless. Great location, very central. Though you can see the Acropolis from the patio and parts of the rest of the city, it is unfortunate that one building/unit across the street makes that view discontinuous. I also somehow expected the place to be a little bigger for the nightly price that was charged."
21757507,495547572,2019-07-26,101262377,Allison,Very clean apartment with a great view and close to everything.

21757507,505941959,2019-08-10,14991474,Mumfi,"This place truly exceeded my expectations. The host was responsive and left us some restaurant recommendations which we took and boy are we glad we did. The location, view and cleanliness of this apartment is all 5 stars. Thank you upstreet for a great end to our holiday. We will be back!"
21757507,508565552,2019-08-13,98891996,Whitsunday,We enjoy our stay immensely. The view as promised was spectacular and the apartment is located <br/>In a  very central spot in Plaka. Very handy for bars restaurants and museums.<br/>Check in and out was very easy and bag storage available if you need it in the next street.
21757507,513792052,2019-08-20,10555458,Benjamin,"The apartment was perfect for the weekend in Athens. Centrally located, easy to walk to everything we wanted to see. Just a few minutes from beautiful Anafiotica with its little white houses and tavernas, but set a little away from the most touristy parts. The balcony has a good view of the acropolis and gets the afternoon sun, so you can enjoy a drink and sunbathe after a long day walking. The cafe at the end of the road (Warehouse) does good coffee, and we had a great meal at 2Mazi opposite too.!Definitely recommend."
21757507,517286090,2019-08-25,38098230,Laurie,"Conveniently located, impeccably clean, compact apt in the center of Athens. Partial view of Parthenon from balcony and, even better, while laying in bed. Decor is clean and simple (IKEA style) as shown in photographs. Great balcony, elevator works well, as did kitchen appliances. Hosts were friendly and responded quickly to our questions. Would stay here again."
21757507,519656336,2019-08-29,34792532,Annie,"Sparkling clean, modern and compact apartment which perfectly met our requirements. The extra large balcony was an absolute bonus! The listing details for this apartment is 100% accurate & communication with the hosts is outstanding!"

21757507,523629848,2019-09-04,44703145,Nathalie,Appartement idéalement situé et très bien éclairé. Terrasse avec vue extraordinaire pour prendre l’apéro. La vue de l’Acropole à partir du lit très romantique. J’y retournerai lors de notre prochain passage à Athènes sans aucune hésitation. L’appartement ne pourrait pas être mieux situé. Merci d’avoir fait de notre séjour des moments inoubliables!!!
21757507,524644109,2019-09-06,225007327,Paul,Great Location ! Love minimalist decorarion very chic and trendy. The host was very responsive as well. The place is well organize and clean.

21757507,527094923,2019-09-10,50403028,Nicole,"Amazing place right in the heart of Plaka Athens! Walking distance to everything you need, Acropolis, transit, great restaurants.

21757507,532234852,2019-09-19,257143900,Margaret,"This place is everything  you need and nothing you don’t. It’s compact, clean, and efficient. The location relative to the Plaka district, restaurants, shops, Syntagma Square and the Acropolis cannot be beat. All for an incredible price. It was perfect for our needs. And the stunning view of the Acropolis from the apartment and it’s large outdoor deck is the icing on the cake. Stay here!"
21757507,533745156,2019-09-22,6985215,Rob,Amazing location and beautiful view of the acropolis from the balcony. <br/><br/>The apartment was well furnished and really comfortable- nice touches like a Netflix enabled tv and kitchen basics including good quality olive oil.<br/><br/>It’s definitely a studio apartment but perfect for a couple and the big balcony is like an extra room too
21757507,534751194,2019-09-23,118526877,Fiona,Brilliant location and a great outdoor roof space
21757507,536574934,2019-09-27,108128822,Anupriya,"The place is amazing to say the least... it's very  centrally located to all the major places to see in Athens ..  There are amazing restaurants close by...it has a beautiful view of the Acropolis and a sunset... <br/><br/>About the room and the facilities... Very clean and nice... A lot of thoughtful touches including the first aid kit with sun burn treatment cream...I had to use it as I suffered sun burns ..and it was luckily in.the kit or I would have known what to go and ask the pharmacy for...<br/><br/>It's very well equipped.. they give you adequate directions to the shops , restaurants etc...<br/><br/>They regularly checked in to see if I need any support... The check in process was a breeze...and so was everything else..<br/><br/><br/>Absolutely recommend to anyone visiting Athens...a great place and a great team managing the property...cheers guys"
21757507,537706974,2019-09-29,9124639,Elena,Amazing location! The apt itself is also lovely and the view from the balcony cannot be better.

21757507,542311676,2019-10-06,2550232,Gary,"Great location near the main tourist spots. Felt safe and secure. Easy walk to Acropolis, wide variety of cafes and the main shopping areas. Great communication and advice. Nice views of the Acropolis from the large balcony where you can lie in the sun in the afternoons. Good noise protection from the busy streets below. Compact apartment great for a short stay for a couple. Not far from Syntagma square makes access from airport easy."
21757507,543622254,2019-10-08,75584150,Tim,"Stay here! Full stop. The views are breathtaking, the location is perfectly situated around restaurants, bars, and shopping and it’s so close to amazing history and sights to see. Additionally, the space is perfect for two - well designed and curated, clean and comfortable. Can’t say enough about this place."
21757507,544808251,2019-10-11,1804382,Amy,"This apartment exceeded expectations! The view of the Acropolis from the balcony (and the bed) are so much more impressive in person. The balcony is a beautiful space for lounging and enjoying a cup of coffee. The building is located in the heart of Plaka with easy access to Syntagma Square, the Panathenaic Stadium, and the Acropolis (and all the rental car agencies on Andrea Syngrou Avenue). There were no shortage of nearby restaurants/cafes. (We loved Avocado that was just a few steps from the apartment.) The most pleasant surprise about the unit: the washing machine! Having packed super light, we took advantage of the washer a couple times. Upstreet was also a fantastic host. Their team checked in with us regularly, and were always on hand if we needed them. Overall, we would stay again in a heartbeat!"
21757507,547447728,2019-10-15,46128379,Vinko,Lovely accommodation! Clean and tidy. Great location next to a lot of cafes and restaurants + the main tourist sites. Great view of the acropolis from the very spacious balcony! Highly recommend!

21757507,562604530,2019-11-11,79367326,Robert,A great starting point for exploring Athens!  The apartment is well put together with places to put luggage and clothing as well as a large mirror for getting ready.  This is a very usable space with classic style that really made our stay pleasant and convenient.  Upstreet's staff were also helpful and responsive.  The location is great for those who prefer to walk the city and we could not be more pleased!
21757507,569317171,2019-11-26,45530321,Jennifer,We had a wonderful stay! Great location with many sights and restaurants close by. Cool view of the acropolis from the very large balcony. All the amenities. We’d love to stay again!

21757507,585723417,2020-01-01,3117687,Louise,Great views and great location for exploring central Athens. Simple but stylish decor in the bedroom. Great communication and check in process.
21757507,593201631,2020-01-15,189163329,Antonino,"Simply lovely!!!<br/>3 min walking from Syntagma Square. Easy to reach and perfect situated!!!<br/>To do not to miss, is the Sunset on the terrace with the view to Acropolis! Simply enchanted.<br/>Really clean and familiar!<br/>To recommend!"
21757507,596255334,2020-01-22,2125414,Mathilde,"Excellent location in a great neighborhood, close to Plaka and Syntagma. The appartment has fantastic view on the Acropolis and a big terrace. <br/>The appartment is convenient and clean, and our host has been 100% available and took care of everything we need."
21757507,607015945,2020-02-17,14594225,Figue,"Perfect location, perfect view, perfect terrace and good communication."
21757507,611843569,2020-02-28,8060725,Iver,"Perfect location and love the terrace! Bed is very comfortable. <br/>Pretty obvious from the listing, but this is a professionally run location, one of many they run in Athens. No downside to that, if you don't mind the more sterile feel of such listings. Bonus: overall well maintained, very clean, and check in/out is super easy.<br/>One small note: During our stay (Feb '20) there was a pretty distinct moldy smell in the bathroom, with visible spots in the ceiling. Will need to be sorted out at some point, but of course they could not get anything permanently fixed while we were staying there. Window in the bathroom for ventilation made it manageable for us, but if you're sensitive to such factors, you may want to double check that this has been fixed prior to booking. <br/>Still, we would recommend this flat, and would like to stay again!"
21757507,616655634,2020-03-10,45210344,Nathan,The place is lovely with an amazing view of the Parthenon - even from bed! There are lots of restaurants in the area - if you get the chance Feedέλ Urban Gastronomy is unbelievably good.<br/><br/>The hosts are informative and friendly and they’ve put together a great guide book. Highly recommend this apartment.
21757507,635832475,2020-07-08,4257281,Daniel,"This is an apartment in one of the best locations in Athens. It is right next to many restaurants, walkable to important attractions, and the balcony was amazing. Check-in process was super smooth and the team was very attentive. It is on the top floor of the building.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is actually bit older and much smaller than it looks in the photos unfortunately. The wifi is reliable but speeds could be faster. It's only 8mb/s down and 0.8mb/s up which makes it hard to get work done remotely especially via video conferencing."
21757507,639394914,2020-07-18,351386141,Clelia,"Η διαμονή μου ήταν εξαιρετική σε αυτό το κουκλιστικο ρετιρέ με θέα την Ακρόπολη. Δεν έλειπε τίποτα από εξοπλισμό στην κουζίνα ,στο μπάνιο και  στη βεράντα.  Το μόνο που έχω να παρατηρήσω είναι ότι ο βραχίονας της τέντας έκοβε την θέα στην Ακρόπολη και έκανε λίγο θόρυβο το τεντοπανο  λόγω του ότι δεν τεντωνε όταν μαζευόταν. Και ίσως μέσα στο χωλ θα χρειαζόταν ένα μικρό ακόμα πολυθρονακι η μικρός καναπές. Κατά τα άλλα το συστήνω ανεπιφύλακτα!!!!"
21757507,650059145,2020-08-12,351827667,Diana,"I had a wonderful stay and thoroughly enjoyed watching the sun set and rise from the terrace. The flat is located in a lovely neighbourhood, within easy walking distance to many museums and nice cafes, restaurants, bars and shops. The host-team provides you with very clear instructions on how to get to the place, helpful notes for once you arrived, and is overall very quick in answering all of your questions. I am looking forward to staying here again!"
21757507,656322787,2020-08-25,72345632,Ben,"The Apartment was awesome! Pretty clean, perfect view, wonderful interior & all you need for a wonderful time in Athens. They gave us towels, shampoo and 24/7 service if we needed help!<br/>All in all the perfect stay for a beautiful week in Greece.<br/>Definitely can recommend UPStreet!"

21757507,671794921,2020-10-06,3452362,Charlotte,"This apartment was great: very centrally located, big balcony with a great view of the Acropolis, the bed was comfortable and the flat was very clean. The team were super communicative and check in/check out were easy. The only downside is that the place is a bit small, it felt more like a studio than an apartment. Not at all a problem if you are planning to be out sightseeing and only there for a few days."

21757507,393148048321662312,2021-06-26,14272532,Sam,Super responsive and proactive communication and a handy guide in the apartment. The best thing about this apartment is the very spacious balcony and it's central location. Room would be great for a two or three night stay but it's very small for longer stays.
21757507,402625725210587868,2021-07-09,269302436,Junko,"Great location, super clean and the best view!  We took out dinner and ate at the balcony with the great view."

Very clean, modern, and chic one bedroom with a huge balcony facing the Acropolis! Many restaurants surround the building of which my favourite was Aneton owned and managed by my dear friend Dimitri! The staff at Upstreet were there to welcome me and they were extremely friendly and very helpful. On my return from the Greek islands I wanted to rebook but alas the 6th floor unit is booked! <br/><br/>I highly recommend this spot! <br/><br/>All my best,<br/><br/>Peter"

21757507,427248846200518943,2021-08-12,69191186,Maria-Anna,The experience of renting this apartment was great! Self-check-in was easy and convenient. And the location is perfect for Athens to explore the hear of the city or travel anywhere you like being close to Syntagma. The apartment looks a bit smaller in reality than it is on the photos and the bathroom is especially tiny but all is comfortable and nice in terms of the design. And the view of the Acropolis is top notch!

It was very clean, carefully and thoughtfully furnished. The bed and linens are super comfortable. There's a view of the Acropolis while lying in bed! The location is excellent because it's central and easily walkable to all the main sights yet not in a super touristy area. Yes there are city noises, however they did not bother us at all. The terrace is very large and comfortable."

21759303,274784767,2018-06-10,59384741,Erik & Rita,"This is a very nice place in an excellent location. With a pleasantly clean neighbourhood and the blue line tram stops no more than two minutes from the front door, you can catch it Syntagma Metro where you can change to all the other lines. There is a great supermarket just 100 metres past the tram stop and the apartment is well equiped if you wish to make your own meals.<br/>The apartment was comfortably spacious though the bedroom was a little small as was the shower, but everything works well and Konstantinos is a great host, making you feel very welcome. <br/>Yes you have to catch the tram to visit places but a 24 hour unlimited tram, bus & metro ticket is only €4.50 per person but remember this does not include the airport which is a separate ticket at €10 per person each way. Thank you for a wonderful stay."
21759303,275878730,2018-06-12,171345708,José Luis,Todo estuvo bien
21759303,276248945,2018-06-13,3219190,Viktoria,The apartment is nice and cozy. It was clean. Unfortunately the air con was not working when we stayed there. So it was really hard to sleep over there. The street is a bit noisy. So keeping up the balcony door was not a good idea. On the other side it was really too hot. At least after me asking Konstantinos brought a fan. That was really helpful. But still we were happy to have just a short stay there. The bed was comfortable . The bed sofa not tho. This apartment is good for two people. The neighborhood is fine. But not one of the good ones. He metro station neos kosmos is not far. About 5 min walk. And so it’s fast to get to the city. Still I would prefer a more central located flat. All in all it was fine and Konstantinos was really nice and helpful when I asked for something. For the inconvenience with the air con he gave us a refund and was really sorry . I can tell. Hope it works now :)

The kitchen is nice you can easily cook at home if needed. The apartment offers a nice view from he balcony and the AC is really a plus during the summer! The shower was tiny, no problem for us but if you dress in XXL this migt be an issue. The communication with Konstantinos was a breeze he was reachable at any time even uppon our late arrival."
21759303,290197268,2018-07-14,188192367,Emmanuel,"Appartement très simple et très bien situé  dans Athènes, le tram juste en bas vous amène à la plage et le métro à 5min vous emmène à l'acropole et les coins qu'il faut en un rien de temps !

Also you can find small shops, cafes and even a gym called “Shape”. The apartments are very clean and comfy. The shower cabin is really small but it’s ok, not a big problem:)"

21759303,346624931,2018-11-09,197559286,Ashley,"Konstantinos is an incredible host. I was traveling by myself for the first time before meeting up with my brother, and Konstantinos helped make my adjustment to Greece much smoother. Any time I messaged him he was very kind and quick to respond. The apartment was a comfortable place to return to after adventuring, which was easy because of how close the metro is. I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Athens!"

21759303,358986133,2018-12-16,45078863,Justin,"Good online communication, easy self check-in. We never actually meet Konstantinos. <br/>The mattress is hard and it was cold at night. Couldn’t figure out how the heating works. The apartment is small but functional. A good base to sleep when exploring the city but not necessarily very inviting to spend more time in during the day. You see the Acropolis when you lean over the balcony and look to the side."

La rue Davari est très calme. La station de tram est à 300m et permet de rejoindre le métro en un arrêt, station Neos Kosmos. De là, on se trouve à 3 arrêts de la place Syntagma, au coeur du centre ville. La chambre est climatisée, le logement est simple et propre, bien adapté pour un séjour découverte d'Athènes."
21759303,473172261,2019-06-21,141232853,Jasmine,"Konstatinos place was really clean, cosy and 2 metro stations from the Acropolis, an 8 minute walk from the Neos Kosmos station. The apartment was perfect for 2 people, and included a small kitchen as well as a nice balcony to relax on, although the Acropolis can only be seen in the distance from the corner of the balcony. All in all a great place to stay at in Athens!"

21759303,604105268,2020-02-10,160434284,Victoria,"Convenient apartment for max 2 people. Cutely furnished but very uncomfortable pillows and sofa, and a faulty washing machine. (I'm sure that's something that can get easily fixed)<br/>Overall the experience was very good, the communication with Konstantinos was fast and he was thoughtful to buy a new hair drier immediately when the one he had there didn't work."

If we ever return to Athens we will with no doubt, return to this apartment. Thank you Konstantinos for an incredible stay. We will most definitely  recommend your place in fact, we already have."
21759471,270423938,2018-05-29,3989029,Brandon,We had a very fine stay in the apartment. The space is quite large and clean and very conveniently located. The team was very easy to communicate with and we had no issues.
21759471,271043791,2018-05-31,23824684,Michelle,I’m in love with this place. The setup and decor cater perfectly to guests! It’s walking distance from everything! We even opened up the patio doors and had a glass of wine outside while taking in the Greek city life street scene. We have to go back to Athens in a few weeks and will 100% stay there again.
21759471,271795288,2018-06-02,5963886,Hannah,"The apartment could not have been in a better location for us first-time visitors to experience the highlights of Athens! We walked to the Acropolis, Odeon of Herodes, several museums and were closeby countless shops and restaurants. The Plaka is such a fun and lively neighbourhood. It was so convenient to be able to take the train from the airport to Syntagma and walk a few minutes to the apartment. <br/><br/>The apartment itself was spotless and so spacious. It was such a nice space to come home to after a long day exploring. Would definitely stay here next time we are in Athens!"

21759471,283642553,2018-06-30,69333689,Erin,"Very spacious and the perfect location. We walked everywhere we wanted to visit and there were so many options to eat nearby. Lovely and quiet inside, making it easy to sleep. Beds are very comfortable. <br/><br/>Only negatives: There is a lift, but a few steps to get up to it and it’s a small lift (wouldn’t fit a double stroller). One of the keys doesn’t fit the building entrance very well and needs a good jiggle to get working. <br/><br/>Other than that, everything was perfect. We would definitely stay here again next time we’re in Athens."

The surrounding area has many shops, restaurants, cafes and is a short walk to Syntagma for transport and Ermou for shopping. There is a mini market/convenience store across the road. The self check in and check out process, whilst a little impersonal, is simple and convenient. We were a family of four staying in this apartment and our only complaint was that the wifi did not work for most of our stay which was inconvenient and frustrating. We appreciated the efforts to resolve the problem and after three attempts we finally had reliable wifi on our last day. Hopefully it’s in working order for future guests. "

The space is super clean, and there are all the kitchen supplies you need.  Additionally, happy to have Netflix and Amazon Prime available.

21759471,455773225,2019-05-20,20289373,Vanessa,"This place is amazing. Super clean, super comfy, great location. <br/>We really enjoyed our stay in this apartment.  Communication was so easy and fast. <br/>Thanks!"
21759471,457444796,2019-05-24,6418112,Yoni,"An excellent apartment roomy, well-lit, immaculately clean and fully equipped, located right at the edge of the Plaka and really near the central Syntagma square and train-station, surrounded by numerous restaurants and bars (there's a draft-beer watering-hole right beneath the apartment!) - the advantages of this apartment are numerous. The beds are really comfortable. the kitchen is fully equipped with anything you'll need and more. Whatever you are missing is available from shops and stores which are minutes walking-distance from the apartment. The host's responsiveness was amazing: Immediately addressing any question or request we had and going beyond and out of his way to meet our needs. The host allowed for independent check-in (we arrived really really late at night) and also for late checkout (allowing us to leave after the designated checkout time - for additional cost of course). The apartment overlooks a narrow pedestrian street and the terraces allow for fresh air and light throughout the apartment. To summarise - this is an excellent place to stay right in the middle of lovely Athens attractions. Highly recommended."
21759471,460785173,2019-05-30,20289373,Vanessa,"This was my second time in this incredible apartment. My family and I enjoyed it very much. The location is great and the apartment is beautiful, very comfortable and practical.  The communication with Konstantinos was very easy. They respond very fast and very kind.<br/>Thank you for a great stay in Athens!"
21759471,469695837,2019-06-15,145358621,Vicki,"A modern, stylish place with more space than we even needed in a perfectly central location where everything we wanted was within walking distance. The hosts were not only attentive and helpful but genuinely caring. Highly recommend."

21759471,477298504,2019-06-28,196056688,Christian,"This is a great apartment.  It is spacious, clean, quiet and very comfortable.  On top of that, it's in a great location with the Acropolis literally down the street.  The narrow balcony overlooks a nice walking street which becomes a really beautiful walking street as you get closer to the Acropolis and Anafiotika. <br/>We had very hot weather and the apartment stayed cool.  The welcome book the Upstreet team has put together should be a model for how to do these things.  Accessing the apartment for the first time was smooth, even after travelling many hours.  I only wish we could have met Konstantinos, but communication was always great.  Highly Recommended!"

It’s right in Plaka so finding a restaurant was super easy.  It is also within walking distance to all of the main sights in Athens.  After a day of sightseeing it was the perfect place to relax.

21759471,654152594,2020-08-21,13496128,Anne Maike,"We really enjoyed our stay in this apartment. The location is just perfect, so close to nice restaurants, the shopping street, walking distance to the akropolis and so on. The apartment was super tidy and the check-in was very easy. Also the host responded super quick to our messages and in a helpful and friendly way. A tiny sidenote (but obviously this is something the host cannot help) is that they're doing renovations in the apartment across. We are early risers so we didn't mind that much but if you come here to sleep in, maybe check with the hosts if the renovations are finished. Apart from that, we loved everything about our stay and will definitely come back in the future, or rent a different place from this host. Thanks again and hopefully we'll meet again!"
21759471,660483111,2020-09-05,92862229,Gordie,"If you want a huge place in the heart of Plaka and the action be sure to stay here. A great location. <br/><br/>There isn’t any street noise, but the family above occasionally made noise. You most likely will be our exploring, so this won’t matter. <br/><br/>Such a spacious place and great for a long term stay. I had a great experience. <br/><br/>Be sure to have the Cremino ice cream below as it is the best ice ever had in the world. The lady is super nice as well. <br/><br/>Also check out Victory Cafe 100 meters away. Mina is wonderful and the price/portions amazing. <br/><br/>You’ll enjoy this place. Be sure to stay here."
21759471,667025451,2020-09-22,77041076,Alon,"Beautiful place, central yet quite, very spacious, perfect for two couples or a family, fast response from the host."

The apartment was bright and big which suited us as my husband was working at odd hours some days and we cherished the space. I would really recommend this place and Upstreet were extremely easy to reach and communicate with if we required anything."
21759471,706696057,2020-11-05,4984673,Talya,"I booked a last minute trip to Athens and splurged on this place which was a bit above my price range and needs--and it was worth every penny! Beautiful, spotless place - exactly as it appears in the photos - in the perfect location to explore both the main tourist attractions and the beautiful neighborhoods by foot. Communication was smooth and the hosts helped me resolve some logistical challenges during my stay. Bottled water in the fridge and hotel-level toiletries just added to the experience. The only tiny downside was that the balconies weren't equipped for sitting outside as many in the area seemed to be--but honestly it  barely mattered since inside was full of natural light and fresh air with the balcony doors open. Highly recommend this property and have already told many of my friends that once travel returns to normal we are going back to Athens and staying in ""my"" Airbnb :)"
21759471,715137848,2020-12-13,66607409,Marijke,Loved staying here especially as Athens was in lockdown due to Covid and I was stuck in the apartment all day. The space and light in the rooms made it feel so nice and comfortable.

The location is amazing, right in the city centre but still on a calm pedestrian street that isn’t too loud. You can walk all of central Athens easily from the house and get to metro stations if you want to travel out further.<br/><br/>Also, my partner and I had to work during our stay and we had more than enough space to work without bothering each other."

I have taken a lot of working vacations staying in AirBnB apartments and I found this one of the best set-up for both working & relaxing.

Located close to the Metro, so easy access to the airport. The Plaka area is very busy yet this location proved fairly quiet. The hosts were very prompt in responding to any issues. We had everything we needed and would return again without reservation."

Well where could I possibly start. Vasiliki’s apartment could not be possibly positioned more centrally. It is located adjacent to the Athens National Archaelogical Museum in an area known as Exarchia. Is located between “Victoria” train station and “Omonia” and there is no limit to every other public transport and taxi available in Athens. <br/>The apartment itself was just gorgeous. Very spacious, very clean, very comfortable with all kitchen amenities to accommodate a small snack to a full cooked meal if that’s your preference. It’s a home away from home, fully furnished apartment with everything that you possibly need at your finger tips. The quality of the bed mattress are just superb for an ultra comfortable and relaxing night sleep. The apartment is huge, giving a sense of comfort.<br/>Now the hosts where just brilliant. We arrived a bit earlier than expected so we communicated and were assisted and welcomed personally by Dimitri and his wife Vasiliki. They were very caring and ready to assist us. Dimitri will call us during our stay just to make sure we were safe and to ask if we were in need of anything. They were great hosts and at arrival they welcomed us with a local bottle of red wine. They even offered to store some of our stuff/excess baggage whilst travelling the island. It was a great gesture. We highly recommend the apartment for couples or families and we certainly stay there again. "
21778294,244981581,2018-03-20,32817208,Doreen,"Wonderful apartment and super nice view of the Acropolis. Very friendly hosts, with optimal communication. Thank you."

Location is perfect - walking distance to the Acropolis, museums, gardens, shops and restaurants. The beds are very comfortable and the multiple baths are great when traveling with a group. Also very helpful in providing our transport to and from the airport as well."
21778294,258071987,2018-04-28,26263908,Katherine,"Stunning view, excellent beds, Super showers, huge balcony to dine out on, almost instant communication with host, steps away from the Plaka and the entrance to the Acropolis. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was a little noisy for us.  It's right on the main artery through Athens. However, I totally recommend this property!"
21778294,261789711,2018-05-07,60508033,Meghann,"This apartment has a fantastic view of the Acropolis and is centrally located to the Plaka and other areas of interest. The elevator is a little strange and the location looks a little scary from the outside until you get to the 6th floor where the apartment is located. The water flow was a little weak and the showers drained a bit slow but maybe normal for a large city in Greece. The property manager was very kind and met our needs. All in all, we had a great stay."

We do appreciate the host’s facilitation of our transfers to and from the airport, it made our trip much easier and the drivers were perfectly punctual.  This is a spectacular property so well located and beautifully appointed.  It is a 5-20 minute walk to everything we wanted to see. We will recommend this host and property to anyone we know headed to Athens"

You can lay in bed in 2 of the 3 bedrooms with perfect full view of the Acropolis. Amazing. Location is perfect for easy access to Plaka. Couldn't have asked for more. We'd definitely stay here again.  Outstanding!

They met us at the apartment, made sure we were set up for all our activities and arranged transportation to the airport for our flight home. We loved the location, the views, and the amenities. Thank you so much!"

21778294,527147604,2019-09-10,46084011,Gayle,"This has the most spectacular view.   Worth it just for that, but the apt itself was lovely, perfect location, had everything  you needed.  Hosts were helpful with any issues although not that helpful with suggestions.... but no matter. I highly recommend you skip eating out and have dinner on the balcony because as darkness falls and the lights come on the acropolis.... you’ll have the best seat in the city"

21778294,635641906,2020-07-07,64282536,Maja,"My honest opinion is <br/>The view was nice as expected the beds were very comfortable, but I must add that the quality of the apartment is not good in the bathroom I had the fell  Everything breaks down.<br/>A tip from me to the owner is, with such a great apartment you should not save on the wrong places. A property must always be looked after.!! Thank you <br/>Lovely wishes !!"
21778294,646197195,2020-08-03,13151061,Pat,"Very nicely presented space.  Extraordinary views from almost every room.  Clean, minimalist.  Location is close to everything, BUT it’s on a busy and “edgy” road with no charm, and the building is mostly commercial space.  So you don’t get that warm fuzzy feeling until you walk into the apartment."
21778294,648557706,2020-08-09,15691794,Liam,"Stunning views, excellent communication,  and a lovely experience all around. Konstantino is a professional and I would highly recommend staying with him."

21778294,408359506508707704,2021-07-17,67511959,Delisa,The communication for trip was great. We had to change Airbnb from last year and then changed for this year. They were  very helpful.<br/><br/>We did have issues checking in. No fault of company as previous renter did not return key properly. We had to call and housekeeping was able to let us in.<br/><br/>We traveled as 3 couples and this Airbnb worked great. The view is great and super close to metro. The neighborhood is OK but I felt safe.  There is a wonderful and friendly coffee shop to the left around the corner- Coffee Joint. They were wonderful.<br/>The elevator is small but at least it has an elevator. With our luggage took a couple of trips. Unfortunately we were there during a heat wave. AC had issues keeping up. This is compounded by sunset. There is an awning but it does have wind sensor and will retract. If they added some fans would be helpful.<br/>Overall wonderful place.
21778294,409128290342293952,2021-07-18,38380795,Kimon,"It is an amazing space, with an atypical and incredible view of the Acropolis, great base for exploring the city."

The pictures do jot do it justice.  <br/>It was a perfect location for us to recover from jet lag and just gaze at the Acropolis.  Very close to the Plaka and many shops and restaurants. (Of Course the Plaka).  <br/><br/>The communication was also fantastic.  Check in. was seamless.  We cannot recommend this place enough! <br/><br/>If in need of a great pastry and coffee head to the Coffee Joint two blocks away. The staff are amazing and the prices and service are wonderful.

21778294,422852289082863458,2021-08-06,36726307,Alireza,"Great location, amazing views. Soft and comfortable bed and air conditioning that was much needed during the heat wave and Athens fires."
21778294,423574736002221070,2021-08-07,48386121,Laurence,"Really excellent. Lovely view of the Acropolis from the sitting room, two of the bedrooms & the terrace (where we ate breakfast), beautifully presented and well-equipped apartment. We loved it.<br/>As was flagged, the ground floor entrance is on a busy street and nothing special, but perhaps because of that, when you go up to the apartment, it's even more stunning. <br/>Also really near the temple of Olympian Zeus and a useful supermarket around the corner."
21778294,425050196094361059,2021-08-09,132167263,Grace,"This is a lovely property in the heart of Athens- the nicest district in my opinion.  It is a short walk to fine dining, shops and the Acropolis.  It is a comfortable and clean place to stay.  Giolena was most helpful and timely I. Her response.<br/>Grace"

21778294,429377195515061474,2021-08-15,132167263,Grace,"We stayed at this property for two nights upon arrival to Athens from New York and one night upon return from the islands staging our return to the US.  The location is excellent.  We walked to fantastic bakeries, restaurants and shooed nearby.  It is a very safe area as well.<br/><br/>The view of The Acropolis from the living room and two of the bedrooms is fantastic.  The deck is lovely, the property was clean and beds were comfortable.<br/><br/>Giolena went out of her way to arrange for transportation to and from the airport and ferry terminals.  That was greatly appreciated and helpful.<br/><br/>Athens is a fantastic city and we love Mykonos and Santorini.  I would love to return sometime and also see Rhodes and Corfu.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Grace."
21778294,430138627126264180,2021-08-16,86104223,Mimi,The view of the acropolis was absolutely remarkable. My friends and I spent the entire night drinking wine on the balcony and taking in the breathtaking view. That alone was worth it. Highly recommend - don’t think twice about booking. We lucked out with an available date.
21778294,431563942597332536,2021-08-18,5679892,John,Unbeatable location. Pictures of the apartment and the proximity to the Acropolis are accurate. Highly recommend this apartment!

21778294,436706194789781372,2021-08-25,403543530,Hagop,"Magical View from your 2 bedrooms. You fall asleep watching the Acropolis from your bed and you wake up the first thing you see the Acropolis, that says it ALL. Very clean and Covid cautious. Giolena (the person I was communicating with) was very attentive to your our requests.  Giolena even arranged a Van to transport us 3 people with 4 luggages. Bottom line you have to try it . Would I stay again? Definitely YES"
21778294,437346206969932214,2021-08-26,7386692,Lawrence,Phenomenal Airbnb with an amazing view of the acropolis (it looks significantly better in person)! Would recommend to anyone staying in Athens

21778294,448231554457641818,2021-09-10,57046784,Eric,"Tremendous view as advertised and perfect location. Walking distance to all major attractions in under 20 minutes as well as any major shopping or restaurant you could desire. Only stayed for 2 nights and would have done one more before heading to islands because I felt like i could sit on the balcony forever. Just as good as any of the high end rooftop restaurant/bars but right out your door. Hosts were great with coordinating transportation and overall friendly, responsive, and accommodating. Will stay again on our next trip for sure. Great sunset on balcony and sunrise through kitchen windows on other side. Stunning wall to wall."

Não conheci o anfitrião, mas era como se estivessem ali por nós a cada momento, saímos um pouquinho depois do horário, nosso anfitrião foi totalmente compreensível.  O apartamento tem uma vista espetacular que enche a casa de energia. Gratidão…. Se voltarmos a Atenas não terei dúvidas em voltar<br/>Obrigada"

They were great hosts, very friendly and they made sure that we got everything we need in a very short time! <br/>The house is very close to the train station and various buses so it has great connection with the city centre. It was spotless clean, comfortable and spacious! They let us use the garage too! We had clean towels and sheets, shampoo, coffee, tea, jam, EVERYTHING! We highly recommend it!<br/>Τα παιδιά ανταποκρίθηκαν άμεσα στην κράτηση μας, η συνεννόηση ήταν γρήγορη και άψογη, και η φιλοξενία εξαιρετική!

The house is extremely close to the train station and also you can go to the city center with various buses. Apart from the location it was also very clean, comfortable and spacious enough for more than two people, as we were… Also, clean towels and sheets, shampoos, coffee, tea and jam, everything was available and given to us!

Ideal to rest and have a glass of wine after a day of walking is the balcony. Above all, the hosts really make the difference: quick responses, useful tips. Highly recommend"
21785201,274010693,2018-06-08,174971531,Robert,Polecam. Wszystko ok i tak jak potrzeba do pobytu na zwiedzanie Aten
21785201,282695856,2018-06-28,6367646,Irma,"Demi and Spiros's place was a great option to enjoy Athens in two ways: few stations away from the hot spots of the city, but next to real life in Athens. My second day I enjoyed a neighborhood restaurant in which locals were singing traditional songs. It was a very unique experience that you will miss if you stay in the extremely tourist circuit. <br/><br/>The place was ultra clean, spotless. Space was big, really big, but I'd recommend it for solo travelers or couples because bathroom is small. Not a problem unless you are in a big group. <br/><br/>Kitchen has everything you need and more. <br/><br/>And Demi and Spiros were extra nice with details: bottle of delicious wine, hygiene amenities, tourist info. Also very fast communication as well which is very important for solo travelers. <br/><br/>It is located in the first floor which is a plus after a long day walking. <br/><br/>Also, price wise is very competitive. <br/><br/>Enjoy Athens at Demi and Spiros' s place. You won't regret it."
21785201,285646339,2018-07-04,11322069,Seth,"Great place to stay, very close to metro to get into the city. Parking place and place to sit outside included. Very friendly. Only minor thing is that the shower is the toilet, so there's not a real bathroom, just a toilet with an additional tap on the wall. However you can still manage to have a shower."
21785201,289366873,2018-07-12,140239982,Sim,"This place is a steal. Quick subway ride to downtown, sparkling clean and very spacious. Communication was super easy and quick. Highly recommend!!!"

Highly recommended. <br/>No doubt to book with them again next time we will visit Athens. <br/>Super five stars hosts. <br/>Juan and Silvia"
21785201,460831298,2019-05-30,29639094,Sara,"Although we never got to meet Demi and Spiros, we had a good time at their apartment. Easily accessible via metro(one change while coming from airport) the metro close by(3 minutes walk) has elevators to access the bridge to cross over.We were not aware of this, and wasted 15m trying to contact host and find a solution. Spiros was constantly in touch via abnbmessenger, which helped.<br/>We were received well by their cousin Rania, who showed us around explained everything. The house is as per description, no doubt about it except for one thing... I will come to that later, clean with all amenities. Good for a couple! Check out was a breeze. One the whole a good experience.<br/>The only negative aspect for us was the shower. I spent the first 5minutes searching for it, after which we realized that it's the same space as the WC. I 've been to many places in Greece, and know it's common practice to have limited shower space(just a square area delimited by a glass partition or shower curtain(that stick to you, floods the bathroom floor etc) BUT .. here there was no space even to stand up straight, or shower without banging into something or hitting your head on toilet seat while soaping you feet! The two nights we stayed we did not dare to shower.<br/>Sorry mate... but people need to know this. Not everybody is ok to sit on the closed WC  & take a shower, and use the wet WC again in an hour.<br/>As I said everything else was great! I recommend!"
21785201,463302353,2019-06-03,263726512,Lena,"Geweldige locatie! Makkelijk te bereiken met de auto. Met veilige priveparking.  Je kan meteen op de metro stappen richting het centrum en is tegelijk rustig gelegen. Heel vlot contact. Antwoorden snel op al je vragen. Zeer hartelijke ontvangst en check-out. Alles is aanwezig wat je nodig hebt. De badkamer is aan de kleine kant, maar functioneel. Wij zouden terugkomen!"

The garden was great as well, you can sit out there and enjoy your coffee. Quiet-peaceful neighborhood, while the subway is like 100 meters away from the apartment. Next time I visit Athens I am going to stay in Demi and Spiro's house if it is available. ---- Πεντακάθαρο το διαμερισμα και βρήκαμε όλα όσα χρειαζόμασταν κατόπιν αφίξεως. Το σπίτι έχει και κήπο επομένως μπορείς να αραξεις έξω και να απολαύσεις τον καφέ σου και την παρέα κλπ. Ήσυχη και ήρεμη γειτονιά, η στάση του μετρό απέχει λιγότερο από 100 μέτρα κάτι που είναι πάρα μα πάρα πολύ βολικό. Την επόμενη φορά που θα κατέβω Αθήνα θα  ήθελα να μείνω στο συγκεκριμένο σπίτι ξανά, εάν φυσικά είναι διαθέσιμο."

We had ample suggestions for things to do and was a great apartment that felt like a cozy haven in what normally feels like a cramped city. Will definitely look to book again in the future.
21785201,515190851,2019-08-22,8006322,C.T.,"This is a great space to stay for a visit to Athens. It has everything you need and it’s very conveniently located in what appears to be a good neighborhood. The hosts were friendly, helpful, and accommodating. A couple things to know before you book: 1. The bathroom is very small, and seems like it was an afterthought in the design, but it’s functional.  2. The bed is quite hard, but others might prefer a harder bed."

L'appartement est spacieux, très propre, avec tout le nécessaire pour un bon séjour.  A l'arrivée les petites attentions comme confitures, miel, biscotte, café,  thé. ... sont très appréciées et nous remercions Demi and Spiro pour cela. Ainsi que piur les bonnes adresses . Ce n'est pas le cas dans toutes les locations.  Il y a une place pour stationner un vehicule c'est un vrai plus à  Athènes.  L'appartement est à  5 mn d'une station de métro qui  ou conduit en 20 minutes au centre d'Athènes.  Je recommande cette location pour la qualité de l'accueil,  du service et sa position.

For example the new washing machine wasn't operating yet, so Polina found a local laundromat for me and sent me address and phone information, which was very helpful! The benefit of being a new refurb place is that everything is sparkly and new which made the stay very comfortable and we felt right at home. Thanks to Polina for the stay!"
21794188,224798004,2018-01-04,35090419,Georgios,"The place is in a very convenient location very close to the Acropolis. By the moment you get out of the front door, you get an amazing view of the Acropolis, while being in a quiet, but very central area, only minutes away from Fix metro station.  Everything in the apartment is brand new and the actual place is even better than what you get from the pictures."

The location is great, especially because of the nearby metro stop. Polina was extremely helpful and friendly. I felt welcomed and definitely recommend the place. I stayed for about a month, and the studio (one room plus a bathroom) was good for me. I think it might be too small for two people for that long."

Polina's apartment was only a 10 minute walk to the Acropolis, with easy access to the metro. There were a lot of great restaurants in walking distance as well. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The check-in and check-out process was really easy. We had a few problems with the internet during our stay, but Polina was quick to respond to try and sort out the issue for us with the internet service provider."

21794188,589559641,2020-01-06,245587364,Andrii,"The apartment is situated in a quiet area not far from main sights of the city, so you can reach them by foot. But if you need to use metro, you can walk 3 minutes to Sigrou Fix station. There is everything you need in the apartment and the host Polina will give you all the necessary information in advance."

21794188,617215004,2020-03-12,137639847,Ida,"This spot was in a perfect location, seeing as everything was in walking distance! When we arrived in Greece it was late. Polina was so helpful by sending us a picture of what the door looked like! Let me tell you, it help hugely, seeing as there were so many doors that looked just like this and the buildings aren’t marked clearly. She made checking in so easy after a long and tiring flight. When we got inside everything was so clean and she left a detailed message of places to eat at and how to work the hot water. Now when she says it takes 30 minutes for it to heat up after you run out she’s not kidding, but it lasted us for our whole stay. I absolutely loved it and would definitely keep this as a place to stay should I return back and I Greece!!"

21794188,645121840,2020-08-01,253804329,Lauri,The apartment is in a quiet street but still central enough to explore the city easily. There are many nice restaurants and bars nearby.
21794188,670052608,2020-10-02,25281452,Joel,Polina's apartment is beautifully decorated and very comfortable.  The bed is one of the nicest that I've slept in and the bathroom is really nicely decorated.  Polina herself is a lovely person and made the stay very easy and convenient and was always available immediately if I needed assistance with anything.  Couldn't recommend this apartment more highly.. excellent stay.

21794188,441017710644733762,2021-08-31,31629076,Chanida,"Good deal for the location, away from crowds in a quiet neighborhood. Space is clean and bed is comfy! It was our first time in Athens. Easy (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) mins walk to acropolis and major sites. Some minor things were forgotten in the space but Polina was very quick and communicative to get what we needed. Things to note: Walls are very light, neighbors and dogs were loud into the late evening, so if you’re an early and light sleeper like me, it can be challenging some ngints. Some navigation tips: make sure to have your phone up / flashlight for the dark hallway on the floor and if you have physical disabilities or heavy luggage, coming through the park side of the street is easiest ( (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps makes you go through main street which leads up a long set of stairs). What was handy for us: the Welcome app for airport transfers, Uber for far trips, and the corner mini market across the street."

21794256,214188831,2017-11-25,17071251,Sethuraman,"booking because we had changed our plans from Mykonos and arrived a day earlier in Athens. But the hospitality and the resourcefulness offered by Jim who co-owns the property with George was just awesome. Not only did he offer to pick us up from Rafina for a reasonable price he also very resourceful in guiding us to the places of our choice. He was also kind enough to offer us a ride back to the airport again for a reasonable price. We were 4 of us and the apartment was just right sized for us. Extremely clean and we could still smell fresh paint as the whole place is remodeled and everything looks brand new. Loved the fact that we were the first to stay in their apartment. They also treated us with goodies like beer, champagne and water bottles which was nice....though not sure if it was because we were the first guests to their apartment. Overall we were thoroughly satisfied with our stay and would definitely stay here should I visit Athens again."
21794256,216098088,2017-12-03,10281395,HollyRabit,Thank you for the lovely apartment.

21794256,221908916,2017-12-28,72688622,Rhena,The host was great.  He answered my questions and arranged to have his cousin Jim pick us up from the airport and he even took as back.  35 euros one way but well worth it as he told us about Athens and described buildings as we drove by them.  He gave us tips on good restaurants and places to go.  Jim checked us in and gave us all the information needed for the apartment.  The apartment was clean with a small view of the Acropolis on the main balcony.  There is a good grocery store a few blocks away.  The Hop-on-Hop off bus goes close to the apartment.  Restaurants can be located as you walk towards the Acropolis.  Main sites are about 10 minutes walking which we walked everywhere.  Trams are a block away and trains are close also.  Enjoyed our stay.  
21794256,224091676,2018-01-02,60368743,Maria,"Very nice decorated and warm house, very close to the city center, to metro station and to the  Bus stations.<br/>The hosts Sofoklis and George was truely willing to help us, whenever we needed to ask for someting.We were amezed by their honest hospitality!<br/>I strongly reccomend Georgre's house for a pleasant and comfort stay at Athens!<br/>"
21794256,226549109,2018-01-11,4354522,Ivan,"I may be not an expert in Athens apartments, 'cause this was my first rental in Greece. However, this seems to be an excellent rental from various points of view.<br/>1. The apartment itself is big for a 2-bedroom flat, as it has an enormous living room combined with kitchen with 2 sofas available. The most important thing about it is that it's really very functional. The kitchen is well equipped. There are 2 balconies, and the entrance to each of them is possible both from the living room & from one of the bedrooms. The second shower is not in the bathroom, but in one of the bedrooms. There is automated central heating that works during several evening hours - but one may use air conditioners for heating if needed. <br/>2. The hosts are friendly, and the communication is easy & efficient. After the 1st day I sent a message to Jim, asking about the electric kettle (Greece seem to be a 'coffee country', not a tea one - so there are 2 coffee machines of dufferent kinds in the apartment, but there were no kettle). He was there with a new one next afternoon. Amazing! Now you know there's even more that really a long list stated in the apartment description...<br/>3. The location is very special. It turned out to be so, as we walked around several central areas of Athens, we saw a plenty of historical & picturesque buildings in Plaka or around Monastiraki, but the areas pitifully seemed not that safe and free of beggars & street traders, as we could wish. But this was true about the area the apartment is in! This doesn't look like a residential one with plemty of people around, nor like a tourist trap. It's a mixed-use functional area where the locals are active. So, there's a big supermarket in 500 m and a small OK-market open every day until 11 p.m. in 600 m. The metro station Acropolis is in 500 m also, the Zeus temple is even closer. One enters Plaka on foot after 600 m walking. We've walked to Monastiraki several times, both through Plaka & around the Acropolis hill along the pedestrian road, though my younger child is not yet 4 years old. It's 1.5-2 km one way with a plenty of sights as you go. It's a good starting point if you go to the sea coast, as there's a tram stop in 200 m from the apartment. <br/>So, this is surely a good deal & the excellent choice, great value for money; central but quiet, comfortable & functional. If we happen to be again in Athens, we'll never search for anything else."
21794256,227507737,2018-01-15,153640738,Raúl Armando,"El departamento de George es lo mejor que puedes encontrar en Atenas junto con la atención de Jim su primo, 10 puntos para ambos en ubicación , hospitalidad y el cuidado de los mínimos detalles , regresaría muchas veces.<br/>Gracias George y Jim de parte de toda mi familia."

21794256,231248847,2018-01-31,100049536,Aneta,"I definitely recommend the apartment with George !!!<br/>Very nicely decorated, clean and spacious. Features: elevator, second shower in one bedroom, all rooms TVs, hair dryer, large mirror, security system. Very well cared for. Beds are large and comfortable. Large soft towels. Blankets if necessary, they are. Cooling-warming air conditioners in every room. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need. There is even a dishwasher. The balconies in every room are particularly cozy next to the living room with a heating lamp. There are free accessories like oranges for juice, coffee, sugar, slippers. The interior climate was taken. Photos show exactly what is in fact. Of course, it's important that everything is close: Acropolis, Museum, Plaka Street, Agora, Parthenon.<br/>It gives 11 points out of 10 :)"

The security of the apartment is also very high. The room is very comfortable. Our family likes this very much. Come back to Greece next time,We will also choose to live here. George is very nice. Arrange his cousin to come to the airport to meet us."
21794256,235996694,2018-02-18,116607731,Steven,"George’s apt, like many have mentioned in their reviews prior, is in a good location, tastefully decorated and full of everything you need to have a fulfilling stay. Most impressively for us was George’s and his nephews willingness to accommodate even our smallest requests. We asked about drying clothes (washing machine available, but no dryer), as it turns out most Greeks hang dry. The apt didn’t have a hanging line, but a hanging rack was immediately purchased and delivered to the apt. We noticed the lack of an iron, again, immediately purchased and delivered. There was a small plumbing issue which was again, immediately resolved. But George felt really bad about it and offered to treat us to pizzas from his restaurant. You will not find better AirBnBs hosts."
21794256,239111018,2018-02-28,113081612,Shahriar,"I stayed here with my family for 4 nights during spring holidays of schools. I have to say that George is really a great host. before traveling to Athens I was in contact with him and each time he responded in few minutes. he sent his cousins to pick up us ( two families) from the airport and on the way we were given wonderful practical information about the city and our stay.<br/>The condition of the apartment was beyond our expectation specially the cleanness. it is a modern apartment with fantastic design and decoration.<br/>there is a massive LCD TV in the living room connected to internet with all medic applications, my kids enjoyed watching football on you tube. wifi is fast and in the kitchen you have everything. all historical places and attractions are in walking distance. try it and you will like it!"

George's cousin Jim, who provided transportation to and from the airport, was above and beyond the definition of an amiable host. Jim readily gave us several helpful recommendations for sightseeing, where to eat, what to do, in addition to his profuse knowledge of the city and its history. Our Airbnb experience was a real bonus to our trip in Athens!"

The living room was spacious and the bathrooms were very clean. We arrived to Athens at 10am and George coordinated to have his cousin pick up with at the airport and he offered to store our bags all day until our check-in time. Our only issue was his cousin was late to meet us for check-in; however, there was a strike/protest going on in Athens so it wasn't his fault and they were both extremely apologetic. George responded within 5 minutes to any questions we had and was a great host!"

Znajdziecie tu mnóstwo szafek i luster, dodatkowo gospodarz zapewnia ręczniki, szlafroki i takie miłe drobiazgi jak suszarka do włosów, czy żelazko. Jedyne, czego nam naprawdę mocno brakowało to porządny nóż i nożyczki, których nie mogliśmy przecież przewieźć samolotem :P. <br/>Bez problemu dojdziecie stąd na piechotę do wszystkich głównych ateńskich atrakcji."

The inside is modern, clean, and comfortable. We appreciated the water in the refrigerator, and the considerations for our special needs. We would definitely stay here again.

Who does all of that? The apartment was beautiful - newly renovated with thoughtful details. Truly a great value for an amazing price.<br/><br/>Oh and I remember seeing someone saying the beds were too hard... well, we slept for 12 hours straight our first night and woke up feeling amazing.

Our trip started on a good note with George’s cousin waiting for us at the airport (he also brought us back). As for the apartment, it was very clean and stocked with everything you would get in a hotel (soap, hair dryer, iron, etc.) and more (espresso machine, washing machine, etc.). <br/><br/>The location was perfect - we walked easily to all the major sites and the nights were quiet with no noise from the street (the windows and balcony doors are new and well-insulated). While the building isn’t much to look at from the outside, once inside the apartment it was beautiful-the pictures are entirely accurate, even the view from the balcony. <br/><br/>All the furniture appears new and the layout was very spacious, which was a huge plus to keep our family sane over four nights. The kids split between the queen size bed in the second bedroom and the twin sofa beds in the living room; we took the queen size bed in the first bedroom. The beds were all very comfortable! <br/><br/>We highly recommend staying at George’s apartment. It was PHENOMENAL."

George’s cousin met us at the apartment and was very helpful in making suggestions for our trip.  The place was perfect for us.  The washer was great, but be prepared to hang dry your clothing.

21794256,489655330,2019-07-17,17315171,Daniel,"We expected 1.5 bathrooms as listed to mean there would be two toilets from our travel experiences. However, it's more like a shower in the space of a closet in the second bedroom at George's place. The water heater must be turned on for at least 20 minutes before anyone showers and the hot water lasts about as long as one person showers. This can become problematic when four guests are staying at the apartment as we experienced. The toilet leaked which wasn't a huge deal, but I'm guessing this didn't just happen during our stay. We found some great restaurants and bars in the area, but would have appreciated some recommendations from our host(s). The apartment location really is great and shouldn't keep you from staying at George's place if you know these details in advance. We really appreciated being able to do some laundry and the spaciousness of the flat in such an ideal location."

Check in was super easy. I can’t rave about this apartment enough!!

All the equipments are quite good but the hot water needs time to be heated, so we need to wait one by one. It costs some time but the hot water is good. The hosts are really really nice. They are friendly and helpful. They helped us order cars for flights picking. Nice experience."
21794256,589560545,2020-01-06,314554056,Emily,George went well beyond in making us happy as his guests. The apartment is on a one way street and if you’re not used to Athens a little hard to find but we made it. It was clean and he was well accommodating.
21794256,591876423,2020-01-12,313393980,Grigoriy,"Great apartment and great host!<br/>We had two great days in Athens thanks to George. We were with friends with a kid and the host was so good to check in early, also allowing us to leave late. The apartment has all the amenities, it is warm and beautifully furnished. It even has a stove on the terrace, very comfortable for smokers on cold days. I recommended it to all my friends. Thank you again George and Sofoklis!"

21794256,607906804,2020-02-19,174532407,Sophie,"We stayed in this apartment for 2 nights as a family of 4 adults. It was perfect. Beautifully decorated, decent sized bedrooms, good facilities, comfy beds and all in a perfect location. We felt safe and secure and we were welcomed by Sofoklis who was so nice and gave us several recommendations for cafes/restaurants that were all great. All the main tourist hotspots were walkable and George offered to book us a taxi from the airport (which we didn’t use but wish we had) and one back to the airport (which we did use and was excellent!)<br/><br/>You won’t find a nicer, better located 2 bed flat in Athens - and it was such good value too! <br/><br/>Would recommend to anyone."
21794256,612306853,2020-02-29,1378042,Andrea,This was a wonderful Athens experience - our hosts were kind and welcoming and answered any questions quickly and thoughtfully.

Appartment is newly refurbished, clean and super well equiped (new equipement). Exactly as it's in the description. TV with Netflix was a nice surprise.<br/><br/>HOSPITALITY<br/>We had a problem with taxi driver that we took at the airport (he charged us more than it was in pricelist) and George's cousin helped in solving the issue. He called the police and helped in explaining our situation. Way back he organized taxi for us."

Ну і нам не видали повноцінного другого комплекту ключів, бо  в брелок не вставили свіжу батарейку, а це трохи напружувало, оскільки компанія мала різні інтереси в місті і не завжди ходила разом (брелок ставить/знімає квартиру з сигналізації, тож якщо одні пішли і поставили, то інші не зможуть прийти і зняти без брелка)."

21795666,299615175,2018-07-31,172912283,Catherine,"This 3 bedroom apt was perfect for our family trip of 5 adults and 2 children. The location was fantastic for the Acropolis and surrounding monuments and plaka area, all within easy walking distance. There were also lots of restaurants, bakeries, fruit stands and small bars nearby. Despite all the businesses nearby, the building was quiet and a family friendly area. The apt was clean and comfortable, with typically small bathrooms for Europe. Konstantinos arranged airport transportation at an affordable price that was very timely and courteous, we hired them for a day trip to Cape Sounion (temple of Poseidon) and we had a great tour, an excellent dinner and wonderful conversation with Panos and his son. We were only in Athens for 2 days but felt like a longer trip since we packed lots of sightseeing even with our 6 and 11 year olds and their grandparents. <br/>Thank you for a wonderful stay , highly recommend it and hiring the driver company for sightseeing and airport transport."

Wir haben alle Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß erreicht und auch in der Nähe zum Beispiel eine tolle Tapasbar nur wenige Meter entfernt gefunden, die nur wenige Schritte entfernt lag und für wenig Geld sehr gutes Essen anbot. Die Küchenausstattung läuft nicht zum Selberkochen ein, fürs Frühstück reicht es aber allemal. Die Betten sind sehr bequem und es gibt reichlich Kissen für den individuellen Komfort. Tolle Decken und am Bett Licht für jeden. Das Design der Wohnung ist wie auf den Bildern. Der Fahrstuhl eine Hilfe beim Gepäcktransport. Die Organisation der Ankunft per Fahrer war super und auch die Ankunft in der Wohnung perfekt organisiert. Eine sehr empfehlenswerte Unterkunft, um Athen zu erkunden, reicht locker für 6 Personen, wir kommen gerne wieder."

We had five guests and the flat was very spacious and roomy, and the balconies in the morning were the perfect stay to a Greek holiday. The location can't be beat either -- just a few minutes' walk from the Acropolis and only about 20 minutes from Monistarika Sq shopping district. The nieghborhood is lively and friendly. A great Athens bargain!"

21795666,460392655,2019-05-29,239430188,Howard,"Great locale.  Quiet.  Comfortable beds.   Very clean and amply sized apartment for our family of five.  Cute balcony overlooks street.   Hosts were friendly and hospitable.  <br/>Though advertised as a two bath unit,  unit would be more accurately described as a 1.5 bath as there is really only one useable shower —— which is not well suited for individuals taller than about 5’6” in height.  Please note that unit is 6 floors up and elevator is only suitable for two individuals at most —- without luggage.   While not convenient, we preferred to walk up and down the stairwell rather than using the incredibly small elevator that made all members of my family feel claustrophobic.  Also be prepared to walk about about 10-12 stairs to get to building lobby.<br/>We took advantage of host’s coordinated transportation services to and from airport.  They were timely and extremely friendly.  The vehicles used were clean and drivers were professional."

I didn’t stay there and she still kept the housing fees.<br/><br/>Don’t stay here!  You could be at risk!  This location is also far from the center of Athens. My aunt clarified; she is Greek.

We were able to walk to everything in the city center and only had to use the metro for the airport and Piraeus. The host was very accommodating and communicative. Would definitely recommend this apartment when you're in Athens.

Convenient place for a family with a little child, we were provided with a baby cot as well. Very warm despite the cold weather. The kitchen has everything needed and there are supermarkets, grocery stores and restaurants nearby."
21808182,702469950,2020-10-21,291906813,Jan,"The apartment itself was nice, modern and in a great location however my stay was far from ideal.<br/><br/>I asked the host if I could use the washing machine in the bathroom since it wasn't added to the listing's amenities and that seemed strange. They said I can go ahead and didn't give any further instructions. I used it as normal however it malfunctioned and the timer got stuck. The drum was jammed and my clothes got stuck inside. I tried moving the drum and got electrocuted. I contacted the host and they said they're gonna send a colleague. Then they sent some repairmen who were able to get it working again and said it's fine to use now and started another washing cycle.<br/>So I tried to get my clothes out again and this time I got electrocuted pretty bad. I could feel it running from my fingertips up all the way to my neck and it moved my chest muscles. It was painful and kept hurting for about an hour after. This was a very scary experience. I of course contacted the host again, assuming this was a grounding issue and shouldn't ever happen unless something is very wrong. They sent a colleague again, who instead of taking this incident seriously just jokingly said ""if it wasn't grounded, you would have died"". That's what drove me over the edge and I decided to ask for a refund. The host then tried to blame everything on me, insisted that there's nothing wrong with the washing machine despite not sending any licensed professional to check it out, then added the washer back to their listing despite knowing very well that's it's extremely dangerous and could hurt future guests. To this day they don't seem to care about this health hazard, so anyone wanting to stay here should take this review as a warning. Stay away from the washer unless you want to risk death by electrocution. In the end I opened a refund request and got a partial refund, which the host sent willingly.<br/>Other than the washer, there were some other minor issues, such as the lights in the bedroom flickering sometimes, the hub beeping every few hours for no reason and you have to turn on hot water prior to showering for at least half and hour, which sometimes did not generate enough for a shower and a hair wash. Overall I don't think I would say that I recommend staying here, seeing how the host just doesn't care what happened and even went ahead and listed a dangerous amenity back."
21808182,705047826,2020-10-30,349114367,Dimitris,Very nice a cozy place to stay grate communication  the  missing  5th star is because we where informed 30 min before the arrival that the  washing machine was not functional and the morning of the departure the power of the TV and window shutter was off.

21808182,467888993813097934,2021-10-07,48221408,Sophia,"Das Apartment ist sehr gut gelegen. Die Kommunikation mit den Mitarbeitern war gut, der Check-in klappte sehr gut und die Einrichtung entspricht zum Teil den Bildern.<br/>Leider enden damit aber auch schon die positiven Aspekte meiner Bewertung.<br/>Denn gab es auch einige sehr unerfreuliche Aspekte die ich nicht unerwähnt lassen möchte.<br/>Am wichtigsten zu erwähnen ist der Schimmel der sich bereits deutlich an der Decke im Bad ausgebreitet hat. Da es keinerlei Belüftungsmöglichkeit in Bad gab riecht es dementsprechend schon wirklich sehr unangenehm und man will eigentlichen schon gar nicht in dieses Bad gehen müssen. Auch der Boden und das Waschbecken waren dreckig und überall waren noch Haare von den Gästen davor. Auf die Bitte hin, erneut das Bad zu reinigen, wurde uns zwar freundlich geantwortet, das dies im Laufe des Tages erfolgen wird. Jedoch als wir abends heim kamen, sag das Bad genauso schmutzig aus wie davor<br/>Auf unsere Bitte hin eine neue Klobürste zu bekommen, da die vorhandene so wiederlich war, dass man Sie nicht benutzen möchte, haben wir eine Bürste bekommen die wir selber zusammen bauen mussten.<br/>Auch hatten wir um zwei Bettdecken gebeten, da es Nachts schon recht kühl wurde. Die Bettdecken wurden uns im Laufe des Tages auf dem Boden in Schlafzimmer gelegt, jedoch ohne irgendwelche Bettbezüge, so dass diese eigentlich nicht benutzbar waren. Die Küche war leider auch sehr dreckig, Flecken auf der Mirkowelle und auf der Arbeitsplatte, die wir selber entfernt haben.<br/>Es fehlte auch ein Geschirrhandtuch um das abgewaschene Geschirr ab zu troknen  oder Papierhandtuch für die Hände. Auch darun haben wir die Mitarbeiterin gebeten. Doch leider bis zum Ende unserer Reise haben wir keine bekommen.<br/> Am Ende kann man sagen, zusammenfassend sagen, das Apartment ist zwar funktional okay, aber wohlgefühlt haben wir uns leider nicht."

Inoltre vicino alla casa sono presenti innumerevoli negozi per qualsiasi necessità. Molto pulito e ben attrezzato di tutti i confort
21808182,472967743891343108,2021-10-14,324334772,Matthew,About a 10 min walk to the acropolis! Super fun apartment and the hostess was amazing :)
21808182,475131270057460514,2021-10-17,101328532,Fantine,"The flat is well located, and the checkin and communication went smoothly. However, it is very dark and the bathroom is too humid (there is mold on the ceiling). There was a constant smell of sewer in the flat as well. The biggest issue was that the toilet flush was not working so we had to use a bucket of water."

21809520,247342057,2018-03-28,77335997,Lydia,"It is the absolute dream house, located in one of the most precious corners of the earth, right under the Acropolis rock. Staying there is just a priceless experience- and Laskarina is the sweetest! <3"
21809520,248744133,2018-04-01,139133763,Ria,"Wir haben drei Nächte in Laskarinas Haus in Athen verbracht und wünschten wir hätten Zeit gehabt länger zu bleiben. Sollten wir wieder nach Athen kommen werden wir diese Unterkunft auf jeden Fall wieder buchen. Die Unterkunft ist nicht nur sehr sauber, sie ist sehr geschmackvoll mit vielen schönen Details und Liebe eingerichtet. Einfach wunderschön, sehr modern und ästhetisch und doch authentisch. Wir wurden von Laskarinas Mann von der U Bahn abgeholt. Er hat sich durchweg nett um uns gekümmert, war für alle Fragen offen und extrem hilfsbereit. Die Lage ist sensationell: in den verwinkelten Gassen des Dorfes direkt unter der Akropolis mit einem phantastischen Blick auf die Stadt wo wir nicht genug davon bekommen konnten. Auf der Terrasse mit diesem Ausblick haben wir die Flasche Wein genossen die für uns bereit gestellt war. Auch andere Erfrischungen waren vorhanden wie Kaffee, Tee, Früchte. <br/>Alles in allem können wir diese Unterkunft nur wärmstens jedem der nach Athen reist empfehlen. <br/>Vielen Dank für alles!"
21809520,251106573,2018-04-07,6087588,Helen,"Beautiful home. Close to all sights. <br/>You are actually under the Acropolis slope looking at Athens view.<br/><br/>Bed is comfortable and that was important to us & clean amenities.<br/>Checkin is spot on & a friend of Laskarina showed us important tips on how to get around anafiotika.<br/>Acropolis south slope entry is 5 min walk , Acropolis museum is across from that. Syntagma sq is 1 stop away or walk 20 min.<br/>I would stay again"
21809520,253029114,2018-04-13,66564316,Aris,"This amazing listing is a rare gem underneath Acropolis,  ideal for a very exclusive stay in Athens. Anafiotika is the neighborhood with island-like feeling right in the city center. The house is fully equipped and the view of the city from its balcony and terrace is stunning. Laskarina is always available and very friendly. I definitely recommend it to every guest who appreciates good taste and wants to experience this unique city by living right in its heart."
21809520,253315150,2018-04-14,3925691,Joanna,"A beautifully calm and chic hideaway under the rock of the Acropolis.

Pluto, guy who helped us with check-in was really helpful in showing us around and giving us tip of what to do around. Laskarina met all our needs and was very quick with her repsonse. In love with the pastels interiors and how everything is designed. Plus the room service was cherry on top. We enjoyed our time very much and would love to come again. Totally recommend it to other fellow travellers."
21809520,259575798,2018-05-01,24580143,Jasmin,"Wonderful place with a great view over Athens. Laskarina was always contactable and provided us with useful tips to explore our neighborhood. The place was very nicely renovated and decorated with a great eye for detail. Everything was so clean, that we thought we must have been the first guests, but there was even a ""room service"" that came three times during our stay (we didn't know that that was included!). We enjoyed our time very much and would love to come again."
21809520,260881373,2018-05-05,178926445,Veronique,A beautiful place in a charming location next to the Acropole and sheltered from the crowd roaming in the  Plaka district. <br/>The view from the two terrasses  is great. The deco is stylish. <br/>Looking forward to come back to Laskarina when in Athens
21809520,262477789,2018-05-09,28993720,Helen,"This is a stunningly renovated home in a gorgeous location, beautiful taste and peaceful and very unique. Laskarina and her husband were such friendly and kind hosts! I only wish I could have stayed longer!"
21809520,264049519,2018-05-13,15814041,Valeria,the apartment is a romantic jewel between the acropolis and plaka. It’s very close to many restaurants and points of interest.
21809520,267027219,2018-05-21,38102648,Simon,"This place was great! Really is a perfect place to stay for a couple! Laskarina was easily contactable and gave us a nice list of restaurants to try out. The place was very clean and there was house service everyday. Location is ideal and has a nice view on the city from the terasse! We had a great stay, thank you very much!"
21809520,267934226,2018-05-23,55783768,John,"Laskarina’s place is an excellent home base for a few days in Athens. The apartment itself is situated in one of the most unique neighborhoods in the city. The apartment is stylish, clean, and quite spacious. If we have the opportunity to come back to Athens, we will do our best to stay here again!"
21809520,268792061,2018-05-26,6550133,Mabel,"Laskarina’s place is located really near the main entrance of the Acropolis ! The apartment is gorgeously designed and even despite it being in the busy Acropolis district, is embedded amongst small residential houses. The route to get to the house is through some really small alleyways so I recommend getting in while it’s still daylight."
21809520,271065988,2018-05-31,52661452,Camille,"I could not say enough good things about this place! The House was so cute, very modern and clean. I will never go to Athens and not stay here. The hosts are beyond helpful with their tips and fast responses to questions. They even left a bottle of wine for my friend and I to enjoy on the porch overlooking the city. When we first booked the house looked too good to be true haha. But it’s definitely as nice as the pictures, if not better. The central location to the Plaka and montastraki is also a nice touch! I’m recommending this place to all my friends and family that plan to visit Athens :)"
21809520,271429957,2018-06-01,17292484,Daniel,"Probably the best place to stay in Athens!! Laskarina apartment is one of those unique apartment that is a gem in the big city. the location is brilliant, just below the Acropolis and inside the beautiful and magic alleys of Athens. the location is so beautiful that you see tourist walk around the area and just envy that you are staying at the most beautiful place around. the house it self was amazing, chic and clean and you can see that a professional did the decor. we got everything thing you need for a vacation in Athens and we will definitely come back! thank you Laskarina and Yannis it was amazing."
21809520,272095956,2018-06-03,24701998,Megan,"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Perfect location right next to Acropolis and all of the best parts of Plaka. The house is also very private, with 2 beautiful balconies and amazing views of the city. Laskarina gave us great recommendations for places to eat, drink and visit that we wouldn’t have found on our own. She also arranged a pick up and drop off to the airport. Thank you so much for a great first tome in Athens. We’ll be recommending it to everyone we know."
21809520,275549594,2018-06-11,14070358,Katie,"This is the ideal apartment for a couple looking to explore Athens. It really is as stunning as the pictures, and the location in the charming Anafiotika is just a short walk away from all the key sites, as well as a plethora of bars and restaurants (follow Laskarina’s recommendations and in our experience you cannot go wrong). We can’t think of a better place to spend a few days in Athens. The terrace provides amazing views and an oasis of calm from the busy city too."
21809520,276265298,2018-06-13,2885249,Ines,"Incredible location, amazing host, beautiful apartment! We just loved this place and wished we had more days to fully enjoy it! The apartment is just beautiful, relaxing, with an amazing view (nothing like a coffee in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening with a view!). There were bath robes and slippers in addition to the towels, a Nespresso machine, with coffee pods, cream and sugar, fruits and granola bars. Laskarina was very accomodating and provided a baby crib, baby high chair and even toys for our son. She also arranged airport pick up and drop off for us very last minute. She sent us a message when we arrived with helpful tips about places to eat and shop. What more can you ask? Thank you for everything Laskarina, for replying so quickly to our messages, for being so accomodating, and for providing a great stay for us!"
21809520,276963232,2018-06-15,66121131,Ellie,"Perfectly located, close to the acropolis and heaps of great restaurants. Walking distance from<br/>Shops and the central train station. Would definitely stay here again!"
21809520,277282152,2018-06-16,122406298,Kristin,This is the most beautiful and tranquil Place I have ever stayed. He was so very helpful and helped with our luggage because I had a broken arm and also arranged a cab for us to the airport the next day. I would absolutely recommend staying here – also the location is fantastic!

Με το που φτάσαμε δε θέλαμε να φύγουμε ούτε στιγμή για να το χαρούμε όσο το δυνατόν περισσότερο! Από την καθαριότητα, το design, τη θέα από το ταρατσάκι έως την κάθε λεπτομέρεια, όλα ήταν σε πολύ υψηλό επίπεδο. Ευχαριστούμε για τη φιλοξενία!"

21809520,286891709,2018-07-07,38470506,Matt,"Book immediately if available on your date in Athens<br/><br/>1) perfect location - walkable to monuments and amazing local neighborhood full of quality restaurants / bars / music / shopping<br/>2) beautiful unit. Amazing views and balconies, quality fixtures and decor. Can’t say enough about how comfortable we were. Sparkling clean. <br/>3) incredibly thoughtful hosts, arranged transportation both ways (which is difficult in Athens as the airport is a ways from the central city), made getting back and forth to the airport extremely easy.. provided all basic amenities in unit.<br/><br/>Thank you for an amazing stay! I’ve recommended the unit to multiple friends and we’ve only just left. We will be back."
21809520,288189274,2018-07-09,19573749,Lucy,"Wonderful little home on the hill just beneath the acropolis.  The location is fantastic, walkable to many wonderful restaurants, sights, museums, shops, etc.  The apartment offers you a tranquil interior with all the amenities you could desire (coffee, fruit, wine).  The construction itself is beautiful and the quality of the materials lend to relaxing nature of the environment.  Two balconies provide magnificent views of the city that pair very well with the aforementioned coffee and wine.  Enjoy this magical spot!"
21809520,289718586,2018-07-13,6912511,Sébastien,Ideal location (but be ready to climb the Acropolis slopes) et wonderful place.

21809520,296634427,2018-07-26,5316289,Deborah,What a gorgeous apartment- everything is marble and modern. It is in a fantastic historical neighborhood and everything is close by. Laskarina was easy to communicate with and it was great to stay here the night before our departure.
21809520,298146517,2018-07-29,8538700,Bilge,The flat is located in a historical district of Athens and very central. Everything was super clean and very pretty decorated. We also enjoyed the terasse a lot. I would 100% recommend this place to others!
21809520,300502998,2018-08-02,16156911,Charlotte,"Appartement de luxe, décoré avec beaucoup de goût. Petites attentions très appréciables telles que la bouteille de vin blanc au frais, les thés et cafés à disposition et les fruits. Tous les équipements sont là jusqu’à la prise anti-moustiques! Localisation parfaite, au pied de l’acropole, dans un quartier très animé et sympathique et pourtant au calme! A saisir!"
21809520,301391806,2018-08-04,23821595,Kelly,"Beautiful, cozy, well-designed space that was quiet and clean and had everything we needed. The terrace also has great views. We could not have asked for a better spot in Athens. We look forward to coming back again!"
21809520,302899167,2018-08-06,188401949,Brenda,"Walking in to Laskarina’s place I was so amazed by the stylish decor and charming atmosphere. It is very evident that Laskarina is an architect and interior designer. All amenities were above our expectations and we felt like we were at a very welcoming home. Most highly recommend anyone looking to stay in Athens to stay at Laskarina’s place. The location is perfect for walking to Acropolis, Plaka and Monistiraki."
21809520,304186632,2018-08-09,169210109,Janet,"I had an amazing time at this apartment, if you want to stay in Plaka then this is the place, the location is perfect you can’t get any better. Just a couple of streets away you have the hustle and bustle of all the restaurants and shops but then the apartment is set back and under Acropolis and here you get the peace and tranquility that you would want after hours of sightseeing. Transport to and from the airport can be organised through Laskarina and a nice surprise was the bottle of wine in the fridge, that went down well sitting on the porch in the evening. The apartment is stylish and well appointed, there is an air conditioner in the lounge area as well as the bedroom but the apartment is surprisingly cool for the middle of summer and the windows open to a beautiful breeze. Definitely consider this apartment if you want the right location in Athens  for food, shops and sightseeing as everything is so close by."
21809520,305214224,2018-08-11,26461767,Ansul,This is got to be one of the nicest places to stay in Athens. Everything about it is charming and I feel lucky to have stumbled upon it. Thank you for making this experience possible

21809520,309975230,2018-08-19,10506267,Gaston,"Staying at Laskarina's place was a unique and inspiring experience. There is no better place in Athens to stay in. We have to say that the pictures on its profile are not fair enough. This place is MUCH BETTER than we expected.<br/><br/>The location is amazing. You will be 2 minutes walking from the center of Plaka, but in a really picturesque, little, quiet and hidden neighborhood which story is the History of Athens itself (Anafiotika, made by the workers that built Athens in the XIX century). You will feel in a country house with the best views over Licabeto's hill.<br/><br/>Secondly, the apartment itself. We were traveling with our 9 months baby and we felt as home. The place is restored with such a good taste, very modern but keeping the atmosphere and the fine materials of the old times. Very clean and tidy, lightful and fresh with brand new household appliances. Laskarina took care of every little detail in his house. She even let us a box with toys for the baby!<br/><br/>And last but not least, Laskarina was very looking out for us. She helped us finding a nice taxi driver to the airport and giving advice on the places to go in Athens. <br/><br/>Do not look further. This is the best airbnb around Athens. We go every year to this beautiful city and we know now where to stay. Thank you Laskarina!!<br/>"
21809520,312206853,2018-08-23,64530455,Olivia,"I couldn’t even believe an AirBnb like this existed - and neither could the locals who we told about this rental. No exaggeration, this is one of the best spots in all of Athens. The unobstructed view of Lykavittos from the balconies is breathtaking. The house is immaculately clean and well styled - there are marble slabs throughout, a skylight over the bed controlled by a wall switch, a steam shower, etc etc etc. The heart of Plaka is literally a two minute walk away - you are in the middle of everything, but have absolute peace and quiet in the home. Book now. "
21809520,312665889,2018-08-24,200119320,Carly,This location is perfect for travellers hoping to experience Athens. So central and walking distance to everything. The interior is so stylish and has everything you need for the stay. I wish I could have stayed for many more days! Very comfortable. The balcony has the best views. If I could rate this 6 stars I would! <br/><br/>The host was lovely and ensured our stay was perfect. Easy to get in contact with. Thankyou!
21809520,315205039,2018-08-28,22741437,Sally,Gorgeously decorated apartment nestled away in a private and relaxed location. We have no idea we were still in Athens. Definitely recommend!
21809520,316862572,2018-09-01,7258581,Georgia,"My favorite air bnb to date. Was the highlight of my Athens trip waking up and having breakfast on the terrace with the amazing view of Athens. So many special little touches with the decor, has everything you need to cook for yourself there, clean and close to the main station. Location was ideal, in the center but in the pack streets so it’s nice and private and quiet at night. Highly recommended that you book it immediately as it was just perfect!"
21809520,319010021,2018-09-05,139588149,Marcello,Absolutely loved staying here. Location and view are outstanding and the apartment is beautifully appointed and very serene. The perfect tonic for long days exploring the streets of Athens. <br/>Recommend highly!

21809520,320573826,2018-09-09,71799031,Joost,"Perfect location! Beyond perfect.<br/>Stylish apartment! Beyond stylish, it was perfectly designed.<br/><br/>What a city. You need a nice place to operate from in the middle of the city but still tucked away for some quiet. This is it.<br/><br/>Host was friendly, helpful and responsive."
21809520,322143379,2018-09-12,23285456,Paul,"Fantastic, clean, modern apartment. The location is superb and within a short walking distance of anything you could need. Very private and secure with perfect views over the city. Everything we could need was supplied and the host was very helpful in arranging transportation and recommendations for locals eateries. Having the second seating area is a great touch and provides a sun trap for a mid day relax! 10/10 we’d stay here again if we return to Athens."
21809520,323306940,2018-09-15,94830,Morgan,Place was so well designed!! GREAT location. Literally under the Acropolis. She gave us great suggestions and called a taxi for us both ways. Even had a really late check out! Thank you! FYI - it seems very safe but at night the way into town is a dark graffiti alley. Little intimidating but doable! Truly a GREAT experience.
21809520,324575919,2018-09-17,139588149,Marcello,Highly Recommended!
21809520,326452404,2018-09-22,80831792,Jing,"Laskarina’s place is an all rounder! Amazing location, just under the Acropolis, restaurants just below in Plaka area and walkable to everywhere we wanted to go and went to in Athens! We did not even have to use the metro at all! The house itself is really beautiful, it has a modern feeling but really homey as well. And Laskarina is an amazing host too, very thoughtful and helpful. Would stay here again 100% and recommend to my friends and family!"
21809520,327589392,2018-09-24,9925940,Stefani,"Laskarina’s place was exactly what was described. We loved our stay! It was clean and modern. She obviously had put a lot of thought into her apartment. The location was fabulous - 6 minute walk to metro station, 5 min walk to Acropolis, and very central. The area felt safe, although the alarm system was an extra touch that we greatly appreciated. We were very happy with our stay and will surely stay again when back in Athens next!"
21809520,330013376,2018-09-30,53817558,Alexander,"Everything was perfect, I can definitely recommend this place!"

There's cafes and bars and restaurants nearby, as well as many historical sites worth visiting. The view from the balcony is very good and the space in the apartment is plenty for 2. There's great amenities provided and the owner is super helpful and responds quickly to anything you need.<br/><br/>Like I said, don't hesitate.... just book it. This apartment is a gem."
21809520,335822552,2018-10-13,6914785,Erin,"Laskarina's apartment is a magical hideaway in a historic, pedestrian-only neighborhood on the north slope of the Acropolis, called Anofiotika. Incredible views of north Athens from the apartment windows and the two porches. It's a short walk (warning: many stairs) from charming restaurants in Plaka, but the apartment itself was quiet and secluded. The space was modern, clean and stylish. Bed was firm and comfortable. Shower got a lot of water on the floor, but this was not enough of an issue to subtract a star. Laskarina was an excellent host (virtually -- we never met her in person) and helped us arrange rides to/from the airport, which worked seamlessly. We were met by the housekeeper to get the key. We would definitely stay here again."
21809520,338638571,2018-10-20,1885056,Kate,"What a hidden gem, literally! This apartment is tucked away in a small neighborhood called Anafiotika, comprised of small houses built into the side of the Acropolis hill, similar to the way houses are built into the hill in Greek islands like Santorini. There is a walking path but no cars can fit through the streets. You are literally under the acropolis and above the city, this little area is part of the neighborhood Plaka which is equally charming and historical and quiet. The views from the apartment are amazing and the space itself is beautiful and modern with nice touches like soundproof windows and a well appointed kitchen. We were really pleased with both the location and the space itself and highly recommend it- it is the perfect way to experience the charms and culture of Athens and also have a quiet place to call home for a few nights!"
21809520,340790474,2018-10-25,78183790,Sarah,"This is easily the best airbnb I've ever stayed in. The place is beautiful and stylish, the neighborhood is quaint and peaceful, and it's close to everything. Laskarina arranged for us to drop off our bags early in the morning and even had a housekeeper do our laundry when we had trouble accessing the machines.<br/><br/>Laskarina also provided fresh fruit, coffee, and toiletries. Everything was very clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to everyone!"
21809520,341938478,2018-10-28,29320486,Fiona,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Laskarina’s place. Amazing location, right next to Acropolis, but super quiet. Design of place very minimal but cosy. Highly recommend staying here!"
21809520,344668822,2018-11-04,11914562,Sidney,"Great location, amazing decor and really quick communication! Definitely one of the best airbnbs i've stayed in!"
21809520,349394006,2018-11-17,21593070,Taya,"Everything was excellent and much more. The location is in a central, beautiful and authentic neighborhood. The apparent is stylish and had all the things that makes U fell like home. Communication with Laskarina was easy and she answered quickly. To sum it was the best AIRBNB that we stayed in. Highly recommended."
21809520,351833841,2018-11-24,54355376,Aaron,"Just book it. Not only is the place beautiful, you have an awesome view, are located in close proximity to great food and sites, and Laskarina is very helpful and reachable. She accommodated our late check out, and arranged taxi pickup from the airport which was helpful. The views are incredible. Definitely booking if I come back to Athens."
21809520,356094585,2018-12-07,1167423,Kimberley,Really nicely designed simple place. Probably the best airbnb I’ve stayed in. Best neighbourhood in Athens too!
21809520,356920241,2018-12-09,3514465,Joanna,"Laskarina was an amazing host. She went way above and beyond the call of duty. <br/><br/>My holiday got off to a terrible start. I left my wallet in the taxi on the way to the airport. With no cash or bank cards on me, travelling solo, and with no contacts whatsoever in Athens, I was panicked as to what to do. I contacted Laskarina and she really saved the day. She notified the taxi driver who was collecting me from Athens airport of the situation and arranged for cash to be waiting for me upon arrival at the Airbnb. All of this was done while I was in the air. By the time I had landed a very stressful situation had been completely taken care of.<br/><br/>The apartment and location are absolutely flawless and Laskarina’s food and drink recommendations are really excellent. But it was the way in which Laskarina handled these unusual circumstances that made the experience extra special.<br/><br/>Thank you Laskarina! It really is much appreciated!"
21809520,360578799,2018-12-21,3588204,Alex,ultra slick apartment in an amazing location. I would recommend it without any hesitation.
21809520,361728530,2018-12-24,22526730,Diane,"Place was amazing!!!! Location was very very near the acropolis and easy to walk to everywhere! <br/><br/>what was most beautiful was the view from the UPPER patio. I emphasise this because from the patio right outside the house you have to walk up to a different patio for even more beautiful views of Athens! <br/><br/>Would highly recommend this beautiful place!!!! it was warm and cosy, really enjoyed the stay."
21809520,362751867,2018-12-27,208567,Ambera,"This is a gorgeous apartment located right next to The acropolis, with a small patio and a beautiful view of the city from the hill. Very lovely apartment, cozy, great light, chique decor!<br/>Visitors with luggage should know that a lot of cab drivers or Uber’s won’t pickup or drop off there, it’s difficult to access with a vehicle but a short walk up the hill from the main streets below. <br/>Absolutely lovely place, spotless, great host. Highly recommended!"
21809520,401590306,2019-01-15,9825999,Pap,"The location was absolutely unique, the discovery of an island situated just besides the great Acropolis. The decoration is minimal and very stylish! Greek marble is dominant and so beautiful! Laskarina is very precise and thoughtful:-) our kids loved the toys :-) thank you Laskarina for this unique experience!"
21809520,402669927,2019-01-19,36295919,Pam,"Great place, so clean and excellent location!  We really enjoyed this space. The location is perfect, right down from the acropolis and walking distance to everything.  We never needed public transport, everything was within 5-20 min walk.  The house is open and comfortable,  all linens were good quality.  Shower nice and hot,  floor gets wet after use but rugs are provided so not really a problem. Good heat/ac in the space and lovely patio space.  Highly recommend!!!"
21809520,404208373,2019-01-23,82177906,Shayla,"Loved the decor in this space - so clean and modern, located so close to all the key sites, and Laskarina provided a guide to some great food/shopping! Great view of the city! Would definitely stay again :)"

21809520,408333206,2019-02-04,15464025,Anne,"Laskarina's place is more than juste well located ! This small house is awesome and the decoration too. The geographic situation is perfect and near from everything. So close from the Acropolis, it is a mystical area ! All the furnitures are design and modern and the coco mat bed was very very confortable ! Laskarina is a very kind and serious host and we recommend her at 100%. Thank you again ! We look forward to come back."
21809520,411005914,2019-02-11,9949004,Maria,"Very beautiful place with a breathtaking view of Athen's city. Leaving there feels like leaving in a Greek island. It is located in the most nicest neighborhood in central Athens and it is just a few steps from the commercialized pedestrian streets with cafes, restaurants and touristic shops. <br/>Laskarina is very helpful and always responsive to our requests.<br/>I highly recommend this place to everyone who wants to visit Athens city."
21809520,413221927,2019-02-17,19325409,George,"Very stylish, perfect location and a great balcony with a view."
21809520,415676044,2019-02-23,53212183,Deborah,Laskarina’s place was exactly as shown!  She arranged for pick up from the airport which was a great extra!  The location is great!  It was clean and she even had wonderful robes and slippers for you!  We enjoyed staying there and hated to leave!  Will definitely stay there again...for longer next time!
21809520,417685552,2019-02-28,120657070,Helen,"Laskarina place is awesome. It is centrally located in the city, all the spots are by walking distance. Such convenient place is quiet and relaxed, just like you are staying in a Greek island. Plus it’s modern and well furnished, I can’t get a better place other than Laskarina one. <br/>Laskarina is also a very good host, very responsive and patient to help everything I need. Highly recommend!!"
21809520,419550477,2019-03-04,232850733,Paul,"Our stay in Laskarina’s place was beyond our wildest dreams.  The apartment was immaculate, well designed and as close to perfect as you can get.  We didn’t realize that we would be right under the Acropolis which was an added bonus!  Stop looking around and book this apartment already it’s epic, and worth every penny!"
21809520,421307894,2019-03-09,28347853,Maureen,"Like a 5 star hotel suite, in characteristic anafiotika neighbourhood on the Acropolis mountain. A beautifully decorated tiny house. Loved it."
21809520,422494485,2019-03-11,10898709,Amanda,"I enjoyed my stay very much! Perfect location. If you are hesitant of price, just know it is so worth it. Stunning view, privacy, central location, quiet. It's just gorgeous."
21809520,426814361,2019-03-22,28929028,Anna,"Amazing place, cant think of a better place to stay at! Charmig, clean, beautiful, stylish, comfterble! 5 star!<br/>Thank you!"
21809520,429235360,2019-03-27,18894018,Thomas,Great location in one of the most charming areas of Athens. It’s walking distance to the Acropolis entrance and many other of the city’s important sights. We stayed with two small children and it couldn’t have been more perfect as a family home. 10/10 would stay here again.
21809520,429870569,2019-03-29,111945106,Rachel,"The best part about Laskarina’s place is the location. If you’re coming to Athens for the history, staying at the base of the acropolis is really all you could ask for. Her apartment is steps from the acropolis and the acropolis museum. The surrounding neighborhoods felt like the nicer part of Athens. If you walk a mere several minutes, you’ll find the food and shopping in Plaka. Some of the beautiful historic Byzantine churches are close by as well. The furthest walk we had was about 25 minutes to the National Archaeological Museum. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. I highly recommend Laskarina’s place."
21809520,431964894,2019-04-02,73781157,Sara,"Laskarina’s place was a highlight of our trip to Athens! It is perfectly located - just minutes from the hustle and bustle of Plaka, yet tucked away in a quiet neighborhood literally on the side of the Acropolis. The place is clean, comfortable, and full of stylish touches. We especially enjoyed the view of Lycabettus Hill from the front patio. Communication with Laskarina was easy and she was very flexible in arranging a later check-out, storing our luggage, and arranging our transport to the airport. I couldn’t recommend her place more highly!!"
21809520,437793173,2019-04-15,1494621,Becca,"This home is INCREDIBLE! It’s right next to Acropolis, and has views of the entire city. It’s clean and well styled, complete with homely touches like bathrobes and slippers, and the hospitality was exceptional. If you’re staying in Athens, it doesn’t get better than this!!!!"
21809520,438576621,2019-04-17,3540636,Rajee,This is a great place with a lovely balcony in the heart of the neighborhood near the Acropolis.
21809520,439553221,2019-04-19,18372238,Liam,"Great house, great host!"
21809520,444005792,2019-04-27,253221044,Sabine,Super schöne Wohnung mit Blick über die Stadt. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten in nächster Nähe und gut zu Fuß zu erreichen. Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt.
21809520,445857556,2019-04-30,105229241,Julia,"This spot is absolutely fantastic and I’m so glad we stayed here vs. a hotel. The location couldn’t be better and the place was spotless and beautifully designed. Located where it was with the balcony it had gave us a perspective of Athens no hotel could provide. Also, Laskarina’s guidebook of recommendations in Oia as well as Athens was amazing. Thank you Laskarina!"
21809520,450063304,2019-05-08,83141325,Nikki,This place was perfect! Tucked away at the end of a street (walking only) with an amazing view of Lycabettus Hill and the city of Athens! So close to the restaurants on the steps too which are so dreamy. Highly recommend this place!
21809520,450663861,2019-05-10,2051723,Britt,This place is magic. We loved it and was perfect for our stay in Athens. It’s tucked away on a small street and walkable to anything in the city. The bed is so comfortable and sitting on the porch looking over the city was magic. Would love to go back! She also arraigned car pick up for us from the ferry and we were an hour late and it was not a problem. Was so gracious and helpful!
21809520,453509483,2019-05-16,2871863,Neil,"We had a wonderful stay at Laskarina’s place. The apartment really could not be better located, a uniquely intimate and characterful neighborhood more like a Greek island than the center of a busy city, literally on the slopes of the Acropolis. As a visitor to the city almost all the major sites and nightlife are walkable. Laskarina arranged a cab for us from the airport and had a housekeeper guide us the very brief walk through the historic alleyways to the apartment. In the morning we sat at a small terrace area up some stairs at the side of the apartment to watch the sunset as we nursed our jet lag with coffee from the espresso machine. Laskarina was responsive throughout our stay. Highly recommended."
21809520,457982408,2019-05-25,142189181,Michael,"Very nice historic house in great neighbourhood, just a few steps from the Acropolis and Museum, bars, restaurants. <br/><br/>Would come again any nime."

21809520,460435819,2019-05-29,20896013,Camille,"Perfect location in the heart of the alternative Athens, small house wonderful and very well decorated, Laskarina and her husband are very nice and patient, including when we were lost a bit before arriving a little before midnight!  Be careful, we recommend to accept the proposal from Laskarina to send her driver to drive you home: we preferred the subway and we were lost in the last 500 meters, the very small street to go home is impossible to find alone and the phone's GPS can not find it either, it was really hard to get to the house on foot from the metro. The electrical switches are a little complicated, and maybe a shade is missing to have enough darkness in the room but otherwise it was really, really top!"
21809520,461820207,2019-06-01,235245354,Savannah,"I cannot recommend this place enough, it is so stylish and in the most beautiful neighborhood."

21809520,469813583,2019-06-15,680499,Sarah,"A little diamond buried in the charming back alleys of a wonderful neighborhood in the heart of Athens. The location is perfect for sightseeing the major attractions. It’s basically under the acropolis. Everything is walking distance. The house is exactly as advertised, clean, stylish, and with great attention to detail. It’s possibly the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Highly recommend it!"
21809520,471252758,2019-06-17,21714446,Daniel,Laskarina’s home is so beautiful that I felt as though I was living in an interior magazine dream! <br/><br/>The apartment was spotless with the most well thought out touches and amenities and I could not have asked for a more perfect location.
21809520,471736992,2019-06-18,13544030,Elizabeth,"Our stay was really lovely. The location is perfect, right in the heart of everything but also semi-private. The house was beautifully styled and very comfortable."
21809520,472292917,2019-06-19,49337947,Benjamin,"Laskarina was very nice and accommodative, we wish we stayed in Athens for a longer time. Locate in convenient location, place was very clean and well decorated. Felt like a home away from home. Recommend to anyone looking to stay in Athens!"

Σε ένα πολύ ήσυχο σημείο, ότι πρέπει για μια ρομαντική διαμονή... Το σπίτι έχει πολύ μεγάλη ασφάλεια αφού υπάρχει και συναγερμός.... Εύκολο chek in με σαφείς οδηγίες όλα πολύ ωραία.... Το προτείνω ανεπιφύλακτα...."
21809520,475971181,2019-06-25,6242362,Antonio,"As everybody mentioned before: This place is amazing! The house, the interior, the terrasse, the view, the neighbourhood... Also Laskarina is a great and fast responding host, organized all we needed for our short but unforgettable stay. Highly recommend!"
21809520,476381001,2019-06-26,30273552,Mallory,Great place!! Would love to stay again.
21809520,479519575,2019-07-01,7799368,Katie,"Amazing apt at the foot of the acropolis. Located on a cute little walking street, you can get to all of the main tourist spots on foot within ten minutes. The apt is clean and BEAUTIFUL. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
21809520,481665336,2019-07-05,36483257,Anne-Claude,"I had a feeling this place would not disappoint. What a great place to come back to after hours of walking around ebullient Athens! Small, but stylish and clean, with its two terraces offering spectacular views on the city. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely. Still can't believe we stayed on the Acropolis... Plus, its owner is responsive and caring. Many thanks Laskarina! You did a fantastic job with your place."
21809520,482960964,2019-07-07,77041524,Caroline,"This is one of the loveliest homes that I have stayed in. It is in a wonderful part of Athens, quirky and arty and right under the Parthenon. The property itself is like a five star hotel. Could not recommend it more highly."
21809520,483973250,2019-07-08,2944944,Matthew,Thoughtfully designed and perfectly located. We had a short stay but Laskarina arranged our car to/from the airport and ensured that we are able to easily get into the apartment. A short walk to the Acropolis meant we were able to get there first thing in the morning with ease. A huge plus given our schedule and the summer heat. A perfect stay for a couple.
21809520,484683787,2019-07-09,14637,Daniel,One of the most stylish Airbnbs I have ever stayed in. Great place in Athens.
21809520,487565097,2019-07-14,1035673,Stephanie,"We are a wonderful stay! The apartment is beautifully designed and really comfortable. It is located in a very quaint area of Athens and well located to access pretty much everything.  It was incredibly quiet, especially in the evenings. <br/><br/>One thing to note is that the area appears to have been recommended in a few guide books, both due to its quaintness as well as the graffiti. So you often get tourists walking past in the day, taking pictures etc. The apartment is very private and well hidden from any tourists.<br/> <br/>Laksarina was available on the phone and her recommendations in her guide are excellent. Anywhere we tried, was great!"
21809520,488497521,2019-07-15,124488818,Claudia,This is the best place I have ever stayed in in Athens and an absolute dream home.  Right in the heart of the beautiful Anafiotika area it is picture perfect and in an excellent location.  Laskarina was a great host and her communication was excellent.  I hope I can stay again one day!
21809520,489067715,2019-07-16,5160737,Anna,Laskarina’s place was even nicer than the beautiful photographs on AirBnB. She was the perfect host and organised taxis from the airport and to the port.<br/>The flat is wonderful and perfectly placed - close to all the best eating and drinking spots and 5 minutes front the acropolis. Highly recommended.
21809520,494441444,2019-07-24,234290551,Sabine,"Laskarina’s house is an oasis. It feels like a home away from home, it’s exceptionally beautiful and tastefully designed, the location is outstanding. Communication with Laskarina was very welcoming. I would love to come back."
21809520,496172736,2019-07-27,88583628,Lockett,This was one of the best Airbnb’s I have ever stayed in! Beautifully decorated and well-located.

Such a great find, we would definitely stay again if we are back in Athens!"
21809520,516414799,2019-08-24,9629242,Ely,Amazing place! Highly recommend! Atmosphere of village in the center of Athens in a trendy stylish house!!!❤️

Lasakarina was very helpful and provided help with transportation. Would recommend :). The only difficulty was understanding how to operate certain parts of the house - blinds/hob. Aside from that, it was flawless"
21809520,519766042,2019-08-29,12937198,Kiki,We absolutely loved our at Laskarina's. The design is STUNNING and the location is perfect. Check-in/out was a breeze and Laskarina was so kind to arrange our travel to the airport. 100% suggest staying here! A true gem.
21809520,520986012,2019-08-31,70582196,Sondra,"We loved staying at the cozy hideaway. The location in Athens could not have been better. It was walking distance to the Acropolis and so many great restaurants, very comfortable and looked as great as the photos. Watching the sunrise from the outdoor area was amazing! We wish we could have stayed longer and would definitely come back again."
21809520,521637865,2019-09-01,277861977,Brie,"Laskarina was very helpful and provided everything we needed. She helped us arrange transfers to and from the airport and recommended some great restaurants nearby. The Airbnb was in a great location within walking distance from the Acropolis and all of the other major sights, as well as the Plaka neighbourhood (lots of interesting shops and great restaurants). Laskarina’s house keeper was there to help us when we arrived and showed us all of the amenities of the Airbnb. The bed was very comfortable and they had all of the amenities we needed (large fridge, air conditioning, hair dryer, towels, shampoo and body wash, wifi, and even Netflix). The views from the Airbnb were very nice as well!! We would highly recommend this Airbnb to any couple visiting Athens."

21809520,525039434,2019-09-07,8439578,Athan,Centrally-located in Monasteraki and beneath Acropolis.  Laskerina’s food recommendations were excellent.  Nice spot.
21809520,527639303,2019-09-11,50938267,Myhra,"This apartment  was beautiful and felt like it was out of a magazine. We were provided robes and slippers to make us feel extra comfortable and it was nice the house keeper met us at the street so that we could locate the apartment. The views from our decks were amazing and it felt like a place we wished we lived in. <br/><br/>The location was also conveniently located around the back of the acropolis and a quick walk to the metro. Just be aware that is situated on the hill and there isn’t car access directly to the property, so if for some reason you have issues walking, you could find returning home more of a challenge. We however loved the location!"
21809520,527983183,2019-09-12,216151924,Lauren,We loved staying here. We fell in love with the style of it in the pictures but it was even neater in person. We sat out on the chairs and watched the sunrise and heard the church bells ring over the city and it was so neat. The bed was super comfortable. <br/><br/>The location was INCREDIBLE! We were in town for less than 24 hours and it was right next to the acropolis and great restaurants. <br/><br/>The list of restaurant recommendations was phenomenal. We had some of the best food we ate on our whole trip thank you to the recommendations.
21809520,532681577,2019-09-20,41164533,Josie,We loved our stay in the most scenic location in Athens. The host was super helpful and the home was impeccable!
21809520,536188371,2019-09-26,25696167,Josh,Laskarina’s place is perfect. It’s so close to everything and has great views. The apartment is styled perfectly and was located in a great spot. I highly recommend her place for anyone coming to Athens! Her housekeeper greeted us with our early check in and showed us the place. The house is located down small alleyways that have beautiful artwork on them. You’ll see what I mean! We had a wonderful time. You won’t regret your stay!
21809520,536568975,2019-09-27,57608723,Nathan,"If you are looking for a stay in Athen’s, you will find no better location to stay in the city. Rich history and a thoughtful space placed in the best spot in town. You will not regret staying here."
21809520,538731943,2019-09-30,174236701,John,"This was an absolutely fantastic location, easy walk to the sites you must see, easy access to restaurants and shopping. This unique area is popular with tourists, so you don’t have to visit, you can live it. It is about 100 metres from the parking lot you are dropped at, wind your way through the walking path, homes beside, above and below, you end up at a well secured apartment with a front deck and upper deck for those sunrise pictures. Laskarina’s housekeeper was there to greet us and show us the way after being dropped off, gave us the tour, quick rundown on the details, everything was as pictured or described. Laskarina was one of the best hosts I have come across, responsive, helpful, with great suggestions, she is able to give you a comfort level that is important traveling foreign destinations. I would highly recommend this spot and Laskarina as a host."
21809520,540269929,2019-10-03,25694240,Nan,"This is a beautiful place to stay and a really cool location just beneath the Acropolis.  We loved the twisting and winding neighborhood paths to get to the house and admired the artful graffiti along the way. Everything was clean, tidy, and modern and the bed is comfortable. Restaurants and coffee are a short 3-5 min walk from the house so we had everything we needed.<br/>Laskarina arranged our transportation from the ferry terminal to Athens with a taxi driver named Spiros. Spiros was great and he also took us to the airport at 6am a day later.  Before and after going to the islands we stayed at two different airbnbs in Athens and also did 1 extra and unexpected night at a fancy hotel due to strikes happening with the ferry workers. Hotels are sort of the same everywhere one goes, and it was more memorable and interesting to stay in a historic neighborhood and to live like a local for a couple of days. Definitely stay at Laskarina's place and plan for a fun adventure in Athens."
21809520,540812063,2019-10-04,3003718,Megan,"Wow. This place was perfect. Sleeping behind the acropolis in the sweet Athina neighborhood was the best 24 hours in Athens I could have asked for, in a beautifully thought out stone home with all the details just right. I was so beyond happy and surprised by every perfect little detail Laskarina thought through - from the skylights to the bathroom floors to the robe to the coffee to the help coordinating transportation to and from. I don't even usually like pink but it was so perfectly thought out. What a special place! Hope you get to stay here."
21809520,546860868,2019-10-14,43605370,Laurie,"This is a beautiful unique apartment in Anafiotika, walking distance to the Acropolis and many shops and restaurants. The decor was beautiful and there were many extra touches, house coats, slippers, Nespresso machine, everything you could need.<br/>The outdoor spaces were lovely.<br/>Laskarina’s housekeeper let us in and gave us a quick tour. <br/>Let Laskarina arrange a taxi for you as the driver she uses knows exactly where to drop you off and pick you up. He also came to the apartment early for our ride to the airport as he knew there were some protests going on and the traffic could be slow. He was friendly and very helpful . <br/>We would not hesitate to book here again."
21809520,548304743,2019-10-17,111065003,Roberto,This apartment is absolutely perfect. Laskarina was great to deal with and very responsive.

It is also very well and thoughtfully equipped for the guests comfort, down to the smallest detail. There are bathrobes, slippers, first rate toiletries, espresso machine. The flat has a beautiful balcony overlooking the city and is situated very close to the Acropolis and the Acroplis museum. I hope I will be able to come back. Ideal for a couple but can also sleep three. Very romantic!"

Location is fantastic especially for exploring Acropolis area & Plaka, but not far even to other areas - we walked easily to the Psiri area with  luggage.  Laskarina has been a wonderful host - warm, welcoming and always available & helpful.  Thanks for a very lovely stay!"

21809520,570764007,2019-11-30,1708810,Abigail,"Beautifully appointed apartment tucked off the beaten path at the foot of the Acropolis.

I felt ""home"" like I had never felt in any hotel I have stayed in before. Laskarina was available and made every effort to help when needed.

Laskarina’s apartment is beautifully decorated and in a perfect location, right in the heart of the Plaka. There’s a stunning view of the city from the balcony - the perfect spot to enjoy a drink and watch the sunset. Laskarina included thoughtful touches such as quality Korres cosmetics, fabulous local tips and a highchair, for and toys for our baby making our stay extra comfortable. Thanks so much, we had a wonderful time! :)"
21809520,598451245,2020-01-27,3330554,Ramona,"A beautiful gem both in the centre of everything and hidden away. Laskarina‘s very special mini house in the foothills of the Acropolis is a great base, quiet, comfortable and stylish."

I even enjoyed reading Laskarina’s books inside the apartment.<br/>The only disadvantage of the apartment was some curious passengers who were staring at the place and us (inside) as they were passing by."

At one point my adaptor wasn’t working so Laskarina went out of her way to drop one off for me (for free!) I appreciated all the design details, including the Kinfolk magazine and the Zara incense in the bathroom. The location is ideal (walking distance to Acropolis and Plaka). Would recommend this to anyone who plans to stay in Athens."

It feels like an island perfect spot for sunsets and sunrise, especially for people who are into good energies. For sure we will be coming back for a few days. Also closely located to the acropolis and Filopappou spots  "

The apartment was exceptionally decorated and felt like a home away from home. The location is unbeatable, close to the highlights of Athens, yet completely private and secluded. Laskarina was incredibly communicative and quick to respond to any questions I had and made my stay all the more enjoyable, including introducing me to a local taxi driver, Spiros, who also was a huge contributor to the success of my stay. I was very sad to leave the apartment and hope to return again soon. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the area. A+++++"

We had expected the terrace to have sun during the day, but that was our mistake as we didn't think to ask. In stead we had a beautiful place to eat breakfast in the sun overlooking the city, and then a shady spot to work and relax from in the afternoon when we needed to. Laskarina is a wonderful host and her place is so beautiful. We really hope to come back."

21809520,388087644262102250,2021-06-19,8875172,Veerle,I would really recommend this gem. Nestled in one of the cutest parts of historical Athens. It is 5 mins walking from the Parthenon but incredibly quiet and in a street lined with typical Greek houses. It is very picturesque and the host is always available to provide advice.  The terraces (there are two) are great for sunrise and sunset. Thank you very much.
21809520,389569201819001324,2021-06-21,48645,James,"We booked  Laskarina’s place at the last minute due to travel complications - initially we planned on spending no time in Athens, but we were incredibly, incredibly happy we did.  Laskarina’s place is everything you’d like a city Airbnb to be - beautifully done - in a charming, interesting neighborhood - central, quiet, comfortable, amazing views of the city, and very easy check in and check out.  After walking around other areas of the city, we would honestly not want to be anywhere else.  We also can recommend the taxi driver Laskarina booked for us to the airport - he lives in the neighborhood, perfect English, very smart, and good conversation."

21809520,422177536347334119,2021-08-05,407577018,David,"Laskarina’s place is just delightful! It’s modern, comfortable, intimate and strangely secluded for being in such a busy neighborhood. It is cool inside and the use of slab marble for floors, wall panels and the entire bathroom is truly unique.  If Laskarina offers to arrange your transportation from your point of arrival, please accept because the help you will receive is invaluable! We liked it here so much that we booked again after an island trip and canceled our hotel. We felt fortunate being able to stay here twice on the same trip!"
21809520,427209997071434184,2021-08-12,336839933,Thomas,"We had a wonderful time in Athens. The house was amazing with a good localisation in the historic center.<br/>Laskarina was nice and easy to contact, she gave us lots of tips with a little homemade travel guide<br/>She arranged for our travel from the airport to the house <br/>It was perfect and we will come back for sure !"
21809520,427994843355317491,2021-08-13,201569558,Maëva,"I recommend 100%! Laskarina organized our venue with taxidriver who picked us up at the airport and brought us directly to the place. Instructions were clear and she was really responsive and caring.<br/>The place is well decorated, quiet, but really close to the restaurants and shops. The plus: the two terrasses with a beautiful view. I can live there ."
21809520,433763866496131024,2021-08-21,4468526,Juliet,"One of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed in. Beautiful, clean, comfortable, and the easiest check in and out possible. We’ve been to Athens several times and had wanted to stay in Anafiotika this time — the location is amazing, there is truly nothing like this neighborhood in any other capital city. Loved our time in this place, and watching golden hour fall over Athens from our little garden."
21809520,436722360529442632,2021-08-25,3141930,Britta,"Laskarina’s place is straight out of a design magazine! Absolutely gorgeous. She was available and helpful for any questions that came up, and also arranged for me to be picked up at the airport, which made arriving in Athens so much easier!"
21809520,439528392033213289,2021-08-29,8849185,Amanda & Chase,Laskarina’s place was a dream. Our biggest regret is we only stayed one night. The views of the city are enchanting and the outdoor seating areas to enjoy a bottle of wine are perfect. The interior design of the home is stellar. It’s a beautiful juxtaposition of modernism in an old historic part of Athens. Laskarina was incredibly helpful arranging our transfers & very accommodating with our check out time due to our late ferry. We will definitely stay here again and for much longer.
21809520,444686592484953176,2021-09-05,2918199,Ilias,Amazing spot in the best neighborhood in Athens. Incredible view and a beautiful interior. Would absolutely return!
21809520,445416684165734512,2021-09-06,68260117,Fotini,Υπέροχο σπίτι σε καταπληκτικό σημείο της Αθήνας! Όλα τα δωμάτια ήταν διακοσμημένα όμορφα! περάσαμε υπέροχα!
21809520,448331844869149357,2021-09-10,30760528,Nick,"We had a great time at Laskarina's home. The house is cute, and the central location in Plaka is awesome. It's easy to walk to several restaurants and the acropolis. My wife and I would stay here again. The front door is down a tiny alley, and was a little hard to find. The map location is correct, and I'd tell future guests to just keep following your map even though it seems like you're heading to nowhere! We had such a great time."
21809520,453322065504580912,2021-09-17,4962856,Cassandra,"Perfect, perfect, perfect. From the location, Laskarina’s helpfulness and all the thoughtful amenities & fabulous design, this is the ideal place to stay in Athens."
21809520,459184518432191938,2021-09-25,5664081,Wesley,"It’s hard to give this secret away, but this must be one of the most unique houses in Athens in one of the most unique neighbourhoods. Laskarina is one of the most helpful hosts I’ve ever had. The house is full of character, spotless, cozy, and the views are stunning. Just steps down to Plaka. I can’t wait to be back."
21809520,463435447180877046,2021-10-01,70515385,Adrienne,"Wow! I don't even want to let say how much we loved this place and location because I want it to stay our sweet secret. First off, the location is nestled at the base of the historic Acropolis in a hidden, private, quiet ancient neighborhood. The views are breathtaking and overlook the city and Lycabettus hill. You are in minutes walking distance to EVERYTHING you could want or need. Secondly, this place is obviously designed with much thought and attention. It is BEAUTIFUL! We felt so comfortable and relaxed that we would want to live here. From the decor to the area, it felt like a cozy hug. It's a feast for the eyes - stunning marble throughout, ethereal lighting, calming colors, I could go on for days!. Thirdly, Laskarina was a wonderful host. She was very responsive and communicative and helped to arrange a driver to/from the airport. This was one of the BEST airbnbs we have EVER stayed at. Truly magical and can't wait to go back one day. If you're contemplating staying here, DON'T HESITATE! But please, don't tell everyone :)"
21809520,465682080326154466,2021-10-04,3354408,Lindsay,"A little gem of a neighborhood in Athens! Though main tourist attractions were very closeby, it felt like you were miles away from the crowds. The house was beautifully decorated and had an amazing patio with views of most of the city. It was perfect to sit for breakfast to start the day or have a glass of wine. The house itself was very comfortable with bathrobes, nice linens, etc. Laskarina also helped me arrange a taxi to the airport. I would definitely recommend!"
21809520,469245126183592151,2021-10-09,14357518,Heather,"Laskarina’s place was perfect for our first couple days in Athens. At the foot of the Acropolis, it’s a very easy walk to the Acropolis and the Acropolis museum — not to mention tons of restaurants and shops. The apartment is hidden among the small alleyways of Anafiotika so you really feel like you’re in the middle of it all. The apartment is beautifully decorated and has an amazing view of Athens. Highly recommend it for your next trip!"
21809520,470698977001578757,2021-10-11,72888064,Weston,This is THE place to stay in Athens. It’s location is EVERYTHING. Steps from the Plaka Stairs and moments from the Acropolis the Airbnb was everything we wished for. Laskarina also arranged a transfer from the airport and it was excellent. Spiro was an excellent taxi driver and he guided us right to the Airbnb.
21809520,474399495336045905,2021-10-16,28444074,Cody,"Perfect location to enjoy everything in Athens. Place is clean and feels like a home you would live in permanently. My wife and I both shared the wifi for work calls, etc and it was plenty fast enough.<br/><br/>Walking distance to top restaurants. We especially liked Ergon House (Michelin star). We went there 6 times! Amazing, healthy greek food."
21809520,475829628657126217,2021-10-18,38790642,Rosa,"Laskarina’s place was the cutest! We even got stopped by a stranger / another traveler on our way in because they were curious about it and the view we had.<br/><br/>Speaking of the view, it was a perfect view of the city!<br/><br/>We were originally going rent a car but we hired a driver, which Laskarina recommended and helped set up. Thankfully, we did because driving in Athens is insane. We liked the driver so much that we set up a day trip with him, which Laskarina helped us set up too! <br/><br/>It’s about a 7 min walk to the Acropolis and everything else so you don’t need a car at all! <br/><br/>The flat is tastefully decorated with a clean modern design throughout. It has all the amenities you need. Even had cozy robes and slippers :) <br/><br/>Laskarina was a great communicator. I highly recommend!"

21820029,249927796,2018-04-03,1064286,Monique,"Everything about this apartment is perfection. It’s in a great location in Psyrri — quiet street but easy, quick walk to just about everything. The apartment itself was clean, comfortable, and exceeded our expectations. We were two people, but would be perfect for two couples or four friends (as long as you don’t mind sharing beds). There are TWO terraces, which we took advantage of. Communication with the Upstreet team was clear and quick. They gave ample instructions on checkin and made sure we were ok during our stay. All this to say, if you’re considering this apartment — book it. You won’t be disappointed."

It's perfectly situated to explore the city by foot and there are many bars and restaurants in walking distance. Important sights are also just around the corner. The apartment is well equipped and has a nice terrace for a morning coffee or to relax outside, with view to the acropolis! Communication was easy. We definitely recommend this place!"
21820029,262840971,2018-05-10,124359812,Lise,"L’appartement correspond exactement aux photos, il est grand et lumineux. Il est bien placé (à 5 minutes à pied de la place Monastiraki et de l’entrée pour l’Agora), dans un quartier tranquille et populaire. Le nécessaire est fourni et si besoin, les hôtes sont très réactifs. <br/>Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans cet appartement."

21820029,277761884,2018-06-17,90362507,Noa,"We had an amazing time staying in Konstantinos’s flat in Athens!! The place is spacious, extremely pleasant and spotless clean, and the location is probably one of the best for tourists in this city! We were two adults traveling together, and we each had our own comfortable room, with space and privacy. Communication was easy and attentive, and any question or requests we had were answered almost immediately. I would recommend staying in Konstantinos’s place in this lovely city without a doubt!  "
21820029,288177935,2018-07-09,128812218,Theonie,"The flat is central in the sense that you can get to  the main  sights  (Acropolis, syntagma, Plaka) on foot (20-30 minutes). <br/>The flat is extremely clean, modern, comfortable and very well equipped.   It is very near the underground station of Thision which can be used to get further afield.  The hosts are wonderful;  checking in was done online, the keys were in a locked safe at the gate and they did not bother us at all.  As a matter of fact we did not meet them but they were in constant communication with us via email.    Anything I asked, I had the answer for within an hour.  This was brilliant as I felt that they were there when I needed them and ""out of the way"" when I did not! <br/>Parts of the area it is located are scruffy (grafitti, neglected buildings) but there are some wonderful restaurants nearby e.g  Koudounakia, Zampano.   Also for cakes, try Serbetospito!  What an experience! <br/>Overall, I would recommend this flat for being clean, convenient and well hosted."
21820029,291547043,2018-07-16,45510366,Hannah,"I stayed in this apartment for one week with two other guests. It is extremely spacious, immaculately clean and just as shown in photographs. <br/>The apartment has everything you could need, towels, pots for cooking, plates glasses, cutlery, coffee machine, kettle etc. Wonderful view of the Acropolis from one of the balconies! <br/>The hosts were very quick to respond to any questions I had about the apartment and were very helpful when I asked about how to travel to the beach! <br/><br/>The air conditioning was great to have and beds very comfortable. Very quite street. The apartment also felt extremely secure and safe. <br/>Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Athens."
21820029,293301941,2018-07-20,51567,Thuy-Linh,"Like other reviews have noted, this apartment is in great location.  It's within walking distance to everything: the Acropolis, center of town that is built around the Acropolis.  It's also near the center of Psyrri neighborhood which is lovely at night (I highly recommend checking this out).  The apartment is spacious, extremely clean, modern, comfortable and very well equipped.   The additional half bath was great.  ACs worked very well.   The balcony with side-view of the Acropolis was very nice.  We really enjoyed our stay.   This was the best Airbnb unit we've stayed in so far.  <br/><br/>The only concern we had was the three levels of locking/unlocking of doors required to get the in and out of the unit (gate, building, apartment).  You need to unlock the building and gate to get in AND OUT.   In case of emergency, one could potentially be trapped in the building.  It's not a fault of the apartment since it was how it was built, but this may be a concern for some if you're the type worry about those things.   We figured if a fire were to break out, the best way to escape was to jump from the balcony using the very fashionable curtains as ropes :)"
21820029,298322950,2018-07-29,12820518,Martyn,"Modern, relaxing and well located flat. Very nice and large rooms with large double beds and a great balcony with a view of the Acropolis. Walking distance from Thissio, Montasiraki metro stations and all central areas. Recommended. "

There are many good restaurants close by along with any shopping you may want to do.<br/>The apartment is very clean, modern, with excellent wi-fi, air conditioning and a lovely deck for evening drinks and conversation. Should we find ourselves in Athens again we would not hesitate to book this place. Thank you."
21820029,318717813,2018-09-04,205494688,Emmanuil,The apartment was better than expected. Everything was clean and tidy. The location of the building is central.

21820029,418950329,2019-03-03,129960395,Natasha,"The place was great, it was accurate according to pictures and the location is next to Apostolou Pavolou which is a place next to the metro and most restaurants have a view of the Acropolis. However, when I checked into the apartment, the apartment was not cleaned up from the previous guests. The towels were used, beds were not ready etc. Luckily we arrived in the afternoon which made it possible for Konstantino to make quick amends to send their cleaning services over within 30minutes, allowing us to venture around the area in the afternoon. Despite the unpleasant welcome, the hosts and co-hosts were very quick to respond and apologised many times. We came back to a sparkling clean apartment that was very comfortable and stylish. <br/><br/>The only unfortunate thing was that I was robbed by a snatch thief who took my phone away from me. I was quite near the apartment when that happened, about 2 minutes away. It was broad daylight and I was out buying water. I thought that since the housing estate was near a popular area, it would've been safer. Nevertheless, the apartment itself had safety features such as the main gate lock, lobby door lock, and metal shutters for every open window."
21820029,422455654,2019-03-11,45496788,Orly,"A spacious apartment in an excellent location - within walking distance to everywhere. The neighborhood is quiet and within 5 min. walk you can find wonderful coffee shops, bars and music clubs. I felt very safe to be there and I'll definitely recommend it to my friends."
21820029,427744158,2019-03-24,12795553,Sarla,"Want to say a massive thank you to Konstantinos and the team, the apartment was so close to everything we wanted, not to mention looked exactly like it does on the pictures. Will definitely be recommending this place to my friends."
21820029,430819825,2019-03-31,26398648,Tal,"We had an amazing week at this apartment.  It's very stylish, really spacious has everything you could need, the beds are also very comfortable.  The apartment is in a new block, but in a very good neighbourhood, 5-10 mins walk from nearly metro stations, and very close to many bars and restaurants.  The Acropolis is 15 minutes walk away, as are other nice tourist areas like Plaka and Psyrri.  The apartment can accommodate two couples, or a family.  We were just one couple and it was amazing.<br/>Also there are balconies, Netflix, beautiful kitchen... and the host was very fast iun replying to questions that we had.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!"
21820029,434586380,2019-04-08,161998130,Manish,Great location and neighborhood <br/>Clean and stylish apartment

21820029,439580622,2019-04-19,177624098,Mindi,"Where do I start? This is a fantastic rental in the heart of Athens. The view of the Acropolis is awesome! We were so close to the Thissio metro and many other sites, like Monastiraki Sq and the Ancient Agora. Location was fab! The check-in was so simple and well explained. Communication with the host was excellent. He responded almost immediately every time I messaged. The amenities in the apartment were great. Nice, well equipped kitchen, attractive decor and a washing machine in the apartment. Really for us, having our own private washing machine on vacation is a huge plus! Also, I am super picky about beds that aren’t mine and these beds were about as good as rental/hotel beds can be. Very comfy. The apartment was also immaculate! A nice touch was the first aid kit tucked away in the bathroom. We actually ended up needing it the first day because my daughter hurt her toe. Of course! In summary, we loved this apartment and would 100% recommend it and rent it again. The host was wonderful!"
21820029,440818419,2019-04-21,129316175,Paige,Wonderful stay and very helpful host!
21820029,445325447,2019-04-29,27373889,Chantal,Great apartment.  Surrounding location uncomfortable with many homeless on streets. Close to major attractions n food hubs. Good value in general but would not recommend for a woman traveling solo.
21820029,453239312,2019-05-15,37141188,Dave,This was a very nice place located close to Monastiraki Square which is a popular tourist destination.
21820029,455825325,2019-05-20,149677106,Carol,"L'appartement est très confortable et bien situé, cela nous à permis de visiter les principaux attraits touristiques à pieds. Konstantinos est très disponible pour répondre à nos questions et pour nous accommoder au besoin. <br/>Nous avons adoré notre séjours. Carol Bégin"

21820029,467946004,2019-06-11,241057882,Peter,Perfect host and a perfect location. You can‘t find anything better !!!
21820029,468748288,2019-06-13,626598,Natalie,We had a lovely stay with our two young children at Konstantino’s apartment. Communication was quick and clear. Everything was expected and the apartment felt much more spacious than I expected based on photos. Beds were super comfortable! Thank you!
21820029,469668701,2019-06-15,7769417,Deana,"Konstantinos was super easy to reach at literally at hours. Everything was so wonderfully and thoughtfully designed, apartment was clean and they even had the A/C on when we came in. So thrilled and happy and will absolutely stay there again! <br/><br/>Deana"
21820029,474529006,2019-06-23,21164229,Christina,"Loved this place. Two balconies, close to walk to the action but the area around the apt was quiet. Upstreet made sure to check in a few times throughout our stay to make sure we didn’t need anything, which was appreciated. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks guys!"
21820029,477909544,2019-06-29,82374824,Catherine,This was indeed relaxing and stylish as described. I would definitely come back. It really exceeded our expectations. We spent most of our last day in Athens at the apartment because it was so comfortable.
21820029,479577012,2019-07-01,86438511,Leon,The apt was exactly same as in the photos.Loved the spaciousness of it.<br/>Our 4 year old had a great time just running around the huge living room.<br/>Great location and comfortable beds.<br/>The weekend we stayed had some loud music from the bars around the area but it was only heard from the living (Website hidden by Airbnb) bedrooms were very quiet and super restful.<br/>Anna also introduced us to the area and a great cafe for a drink with a view of the Pantheon.Plus the apt was a 2 min walk to Thissio metro station where all the other major Athens attractions were just a few stops away at the most.<br/>We mostly just walked as it was so convenient and close plus great restaurants around every corner!
21820029,482153239,2019-07-06,69886011,Sharma,"Our stay was excellent! The loft is exactly as billed in an excellent location that is walking distance to everything. It is clean, nicely appointed and has all the essentials. There is traditional Greek food only about a 5-10 minute walk away, grocery close by, and even better most of the historical sites are about a hop away. As it is in a central area getting a cab is also quite easy. Safety didn’t seem to be a problem. Communication with the team was easy and timely. Thoughtful welcome guide that included all the key elements. Would stay here again."
21820029,485630039,2019-07-11,242271526,Patrick,"This place hit every mark, great location (near the metro), chic decorations, well maintained and communicative hosts.  We were very happy here."
21820029,489675688,2019-07-17,23734700,Adele Deidre,"We stayed in this apartment for 5 days and I found the location, amenities and the host's prompt responses all excellent. The apartment is very spacious and well designed with block out blinds for large windows which make the apartment feel lovely and bright but still, you can sleep well at night. It has everything you would need and your best surprise will be the location... Lots of fantastic bars and restaurants within walking distance and very easy access to the airport via the metro. 4 of us shared the apartment comfortably. Konstantinos was an excellent host. Check in and check out was easy and an elevator for luggage is a plus. I can highly recommend this apartment and Konstantinos.<br/>Thx for a wonderful stay!"
21820029,491525843,2019-07-20,39738738,Justin,Amazing interior apartment. Very modern and up to date. Easy check in process and quite close to the main square. Would stay again!

We enjoyed every minute spent in the house.<br/><br/>Decoration was modern and minimalistic.<br/>The house was clean and beds were super comfy.<br/><br/>Location wise, was superb. 10mns away walking from all the restaurants and bars. Also, close to the center and to the Fleamarket. <br/><br/>Would have appreciated a small welcome basket as we were checking in late night and the groceries were closed."
21820029,511137844,2019-08-17,191300097,Axelle,"This was a beautiful home filled with amazing furniture and unique characteristics! The whole staff was amazing to work with and made the experience easy, yet entirely thoughtful. Although we didn’t stay long, the home exceeded our expectations and we would be happy to find ourselves there time and time again. Would definitely recommend it to all Air Bnb travelers going through Athens!"
21820029,514977204,2019-08-22,25913057,Carla,Excellent stay with our 3yr old son. Family friendly apartment with lots of space and very comfortable. Good location to explore Athens by foot and the lift made it easy to get luggage/pram in and out. Would recommend.

21820029,527552103,2019-09-11,277915685,Irene,Awesome interiors and great service. The location could be better and at times felt a bit unsafe but this area is still up and coming in Athens. Otherwise outstanding.
21820029,533200030,2019-09-21,7932253,Lesley,"Fantastic apartment in a brilliant location. Really great space. Modern apartment with all amenities. Felt really secure. Check in was faultless, A’s was the transfer arranged by Upstreet.<br/>Tonnes of info in the apartment and minutes from the fantastic bars and restaurants of Psiri.<br/>We would have appreciated a couple of dishwasher tablets but all else was spot on. <br/>Comma were friendly and efficient though we didn’t really need much. <br/>I’d stay again in a heartbeat."
21820029,535388149,2019-09-24,80612680,Michelle,Apartment was clean and comfortable with all basic amenities for staying. Venue is close to the main street and walking distance to Acropolis. Upstreet was also very responsive and considerate.

We received detailed arrival instructions, so there weren’t any problems with checking in. The appartment was clean and very well equipped. All things necessary for the stay were there.

21820029,595400248,2020-01-20,33618184,Ayal,More than what we expected.<br/>The place is in the best location with a view to the Acropolis. Well decorated and very chic and comfortable. It made our vacation extra good with the modern yet homey interior design and facilities. Well done to our hosts!
21820029,603411794,2020-02-09,282331140,Aegean,Thank you for a perfect staying! We feel very comfortable at all times.
21820029,622625872,2020-04-18,342452447,Βασιλης,Φοβερό σπίτι η διαμονή μας ήταν φανταστική!
21820029,625384208,2020-05-20,32548865,Bailey,"Our stay was absolutely wonderful. The location of the apartment is perfect. You can easily walk everywhere and there are plenty of bars/restaurants/cafes/shops within a few blocks while still being on a quiet street. We loved sitting outside on the balcony in the morning with a coffee or a drink in the evening. The kitchen is well stocked and has everything you need to make meals ""at home"". The beds were super comfortable and it was very convenient to have 1.5 baths. The group at Upstreet was very friendly and responded quickly to our messages. We originally planned to stay for a month but due to a change in travel, we ended up booking another month. Whether you are only in Athens for a few days or if it is a long term stay, this place is perfect. There were only two of us, but the apartment could easily accommodate two couples or a family. We would love to stay here again!"
21820029,630172526,2020-06-17,32548865,Bailey,We stayed at this Airbnb for two months and it was perfect! The hosts at Upstreet made sure we had everything we needed and responded quickly. Location is wonderful and the apartment is spotless. I really hope to stay here again in the future.
21820029,640430710,2020-07-20,151287314,Alex,The Host was very helpful! Check in and check out was as easy as can be. They really went above and beyond with helpful important Information.<br/>I have stayed at several AIRBNB locations and this is the best! Great location with a view of the Acropolis. <br/>Thank you for having us!
21820029,660445847,2020-09-05,4287247,Alexi,The flat is big and airy with big windows which open out onto two balconies (at the front and rear) very comfortable beds and sofa and plenty of linen and towels and an excellent washing machine. The kitchen equipment is limited so not great for cooking meals - but everything works. Could do with some extra pans and a chopping board. <br/><br/>Nice to have a Nespresso machine plus a filter coffee pot. <br/><br/>The bathroom is a bit small - a walk in wet room may have worked better in the space but it helped having the second loo/cloakroom. The hot water is great. <br/><br/>Very comfortable flat for a long or short stay in a great location. Very central and five mins walk to Thisio metro and ten mins to Kolonaki. Lots of bars and restaurants close by. And you walk to the Parthenon. <br/><br/>Upstreet hosts communicate very well and do a great job.
21820029,663675511,2020-09-13,35006100,Elizmari,"Great spot, close to town with a very helpful team of hosts. Spacious, clean and minimalistic. Bathroom could be somewhat better - but overall a wonderful stay."
21820029,707818609,2020-11-09,371251717,George,"This is a great apartment in a central but quiet and safe area of Athens. It feels very homey, has all amenities, great taste in furniture and very comfortable. The apartment block is also clean and well-maintained. The host is a company, whose people are very professional, polite and responsive. They are very sensitive to potential maintenance issues and did their best to accommodate a few minor requests we had during our stay. We would strongly recommend it to potential travellers who want to get the vibe of the Athenian city centre."
21820029,745202367,2021-04-04,375350663,Zhang Lian,"房东很热情,回应很迅速,出现的问题很快就解决了｡房间的装饰和布局我很喜欢,住得很温馨｡总之,是一段愉快的旅程｡"

21820029,395411743245710481,2021-06-29,168778949,Oliver,"A nice apartment with a good location. The company communicated well, and the place was clean. The bathrooms are very dark and the shower glass had a gap at the bottom which meant the bathroom floor always got soaked. The brochure was incorrect as to where to find the garbage disposal, so we had to keep the garbage bagged up in the kitchen as we could not find a bin on the street."
21820029,406249546172532406,2021-07-14,22493546,Nafis,"I'm not sure if this is a new apartment, but it felt like one. Very clean, modern, and spacious. Excellent location. View of the Acropolis from the balcony.  Will definitely look to stay here again the next time I'm in Athens."

21820029,414978976930557962,2021-07-26,104320041,Ashlee,"The apartment is functional, in a central, hip area and the price is fair.   We were comfortable for a short stay in Athens.  That’s said, the bathroom is a bit small and I am not sure that this is should be part of the Airbnb Plus portfolio.  There is nothing wrong with it, per se, but it’s a basic accommodation.  Also, we were really surprised that they charge 30 euros for a baby bed.  I have stayed in many Airbnb’s and other accommodations and have never been charged for this. I explained to the management company this felt like a surcharge for a baby ( since you don’t really have a choice but to pay) so hopefully they consider that for future stays."
21820029,425101985353339405,2021-08-09,10591014,Whitney,"Perfect spot for two couples to explore the neighborhoods around the Acropolis. The beds were super comfy and the air conditioning in each room was a godsend in the 100+ degree heat. We're from Los Angeles and thoroughly enjoyed our week stay with Upstreet ! Great space and excellent location--especially for the price.  We didn't use the full kitchen, but for an extended vacation or work trip, the space would be ideal. The washer was very helpful since we had been traveling for a week prior with small suitcases. Highly recommend!"
21820029,429384738775575936,2021-08-15,283183139,Conrad,"Très bel appartement. Situé dans un bon quartier, à 2 pas du centre! <br/>Rien à reprocher!"
21820029,440986553566737359,2021-08-31,49085484,Alex,"Wow! So glad I found this apartment. They were able to accommodate a last minute booking the day before check in. Amazing location 10 mins walking to Monastiraki Square and great shops/Athens flea market. About 15/20 mins to Acropolis. And 5 mins walk away from this cute winding alley with so many colorful bars and restaurants.<br/><br/>The area itself looks sketchy because of the graffiti, but graffiti is everywhere there. I felt safe walking to and from apartment at night - obviously being aware of surroundings/streets to avoid. <br/><br/>Inside was stylish and comfortable with modern amenities and AC! Good beds, spacious rooms.<br/><br/>Only issue was with a late check in, which was due to a previous renter checking out way later than they were supposed to. We killed time at a great cafe and people watched and the Upstreet team communicated well updating us throughout the process. <br/><br/>Highly recommend this place for your vacation in Athens! There were 2 of us, but the place could easily accommodate 4 people in beds or 5 including the sofa in living room."
21820029,445389060346919863,2021-09-06,6549769,Michael,Great stay. Easy to get in and the apartment is in a quiet street just away from everything you want to see.

21820029,470755114990520251,2021-10-11,40281999,Michael,It was a real pleasure staying at the unit. The apartment is conveniently located and only a short walk from tourist areas. It’s also very close to a grocery store and plenty of yummy breakfast places and restaurants.<br/><br/>The fully equipped apartment corresponds to the description.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this place to anyone wanting a convenient place in Athens.
21820029,475055053610630037,2021-10-17,47214666,Brandon,"This place is AMAZING!. This room not only met my expectations, it exceeded them. It was a beautifully appointed room that had everything I needed. The location was great as it is located not too far from Monstiraki and the Theseio station is very close by as well. Additionally, the host is super responsive in making sure I had everything I needed. 5 stars! I would definitely recommend staying here again."
21820029,477943509664234977,2021-10-21,22916041,Marina,"Nous avons passé un superbe séjour dans cet appartement propre, soigné, bien décoré et très bien équipé. <br/>Il est également bien situé, puisqu’il est possible de se rendre à pied sur la majeure partie des sites archéologiques les plus connus d’Athènes. La ruelle est assez calme (il y a une école en face du salon) mais il suffit de marcher 5 minutes pour trouver de nombreux restaurants et petits commerces. <br/>L’hôte est très réactif et à l’écoute.<br/>Nous recommandons pleinement cet appartement!"
21820029,480173665023186079,2021-10-24,63039071,Tanja,Die Wohnung ist sehr zentral gelegen und trotzdem ruhig. Alles hat super funktioniert. Auch der Transfer mit dem Taxi zum Flughafen. Der Kontakt wurde ebenfalls durch upstreet vermittelt. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt und kommen gerne wieder!
21824900,219645993,2017-12-18,3161173,Natalie,"Kolonaki is one of the best neighborhoods in all of Athens. If you are looking for easy access to great restaurants, bars, organic grocers, luxury shopping and easy transport to the Metro... then this is an amazing spot. It's even footsteps from a hospital and a church. Most important of all, you will feel very safe.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a place to hide away and relax, you will find everything you need in this unit except access to a laundry machine. However there are multiple laundry services near by.  This place is perfect for someone with a flair for vintage style.  The decor is very much authentic and from it's time.  Everything is clean and quaint. You can pick fruit off of the balcony and forget about the rest of the world.  The unit isn't extremely quite but it's very private.<br/><br/>Myrsini is an excellent host and was always responsive.  As with any AirBnb, it's not a matter if something is perfect, but whether or not the host is willing to accommodate.  Check-in time for a bit later than usual but we were able to work it out. <br/><br/>My only warning is that it may be a bit cold for some during the winter.  There is a heating system but if you're particularly sensitive to weather like me, just make sure you're packing respectable winter PJs and thick bunny slippers.  Other than that - it's a great little place in a prime location."
21824900,224761064,2018-01-04,36642697,Lee,"Beautiful apartment just as in the pictures. Each room has an individually controlled heater so apartment was always cozy and warm. Ground floor, but it's a very secure building -- no issues there whatsoever.  It's in an upmarket area and there are plenty of shops and restaurants around. On the whole a very good experience and I would strongly recommend this apartment."

The pictures represent it well. <br/><br/>Myrsini was fantastic at both communication and flexibility on check in. Our flight was delayed by 28hours but she still handled check in with ease. We always had quick communication and she worked with us around the delay which made it so easy and pleasant.<br/><br/>Would recommend highly"

21824900,325657244,2018-09-20,14309257,Charlie,"We were greeted by a friend of the host and shown round this lovely apartment, which has everything you want for a simple convenient stay in Athens.  We literally just had to step out the door to find ourself in leafy streets full of lovely bars and restaurants.  If you set your mind to a brisk walk you could be at the Parthenon within 20 minutes and the Cycladic museum was right in the neighbourhood.<br/><br/>The flat itself is on the ground floor, was very clean with high ceilings and a little balcony, looking into the block.  The bed was very firm, which suited us.  The shower was good and water system heated up instantly.  We did not cook in the flat, but the kitchen fine.  WiFi was also good.<br/><br/>All in all a really lovely little flat for a stay in a  pleasant part of Athens."

21824900,466279494,2019-06-09,15850038,Cecilia,"The apartment was clean, comfortable, and excellently located! Kolonaki is a very nice neighborhood in Athens. The apartment was a 1-2 minute walk from the Evangelismos metro stop and a short walk to the Cycladic Museum and the Byzantine and Christian Museum—two favorites of ours. It is right at the base of Lykavettos hill, which we like to hike up.<br/>The hostess was very quick to reply to messages and very responsive. Check-in was easily arranged. In fact, she willingly worked with me when I indicated that I would like to arrive a little earlier than originally anticipated. <br/>The kitchen worked fine for us. As it happened, we ate out for most meals, but we could have cooked had we wanted to.<br/>This was a great place for my husband and me, and I can recommend it without hesitation. <br/>Thanks to Myrsini for a lovely stay in a great location!"
21824900,540257079,2019-10-03,42484146,Michael,"For one reason alone we are not rating this accommodation highly.  We were initially pleased with the location and the quietness of the apartment, which is located on the back side of the building, away from street noise.  It is also very clean.  Unfortunately we did not sleep well here because of the very squeaky bed.  Each time one of us moved we would both wake up... and we each travel over 100 days a year so are used to sleeping in many different beds.  With a different mattress we would rate this a 5 star."

Especially, my girlfriend photographing the amazing handmade creations that Olympia offered with all her heart for sharing her guests. We really enjoyed our time in Greece. (It's true,the house is just 200 steps of Acropolis). We started a wonderful walk from Olympia's house across the historic center of Athens, Plaka,Monastiraki,Acropolis,Thissio. We ate traditional greeck food at Monastiraki, we drunk coffee at Plaka and then returned back to the relaxing home and enjoyed a frozen wine that was waiting for us in the fridge. Thank you Olympia. ❤️"

The flat was comfortable and had everything that was needed, including air-conditioning. Communication was fast and possible in English. In the area there are many bars and restaurants where you can eat delicious and not too expensive. Additionally , there is a supermarket 20 m away from the flat. We really enjoyed our days there. There was one thing that should be said before booking. Check-in and check-out times are depending on the quests that are leaving or coming, respectively. Therefore, we could check in after 13 and had to check out by 12. Our flight was leaving at 20, so we had to store our luggage in a storage place, that is 20 m from the flat. However, it is additional cost of 6 or 8 € for medium or big luggage, respectively. Besides that everything was as it was expected."

The equipment was in big part brand new, bought for guests. <br/>We really enjoyed all those small conveniences like olive, tea, sugar. The sheets also smelled really nice.<br/>There was  small issue with hot water during our stay, but thanks to quick reaction of Thalia, the problem was quickly resolved. She truly cares for her guests.<br/>I would really recommend everyone looking for good value for money."

It has everything you need to spend a few days (washing machine, wifi, kitchen, air conditioning) and it is clean. Although some details draw attention, as the washing machine ejects dirty water into the bathtub and that the sink and glass of the dining room table were loose."
21826094,330861412,2018-10-01,26495679,Jamie,"Thalia's place in Athen's was great for us three travelers! It was a close 17 minutes walk to Syntagma square, and even closer to the hop on hop off bus stops and the metro! A quick 5 euro taxi beat also got us home easily. It was exactly what we were expecting and hoping for. Communicating with her was great, and check in and check out were easy. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here in Athens!"

21826094,454357557,2019-05-18,40984922,Tetiana,"Hi Everyone<br/>If you want to find a flat in the perfect location - here it is. Walking distance to the parks, several museums, funicular, and.... Acropolis, as well as many other things.  When I say about walking distance - I mean it, and it's confirmed by my 4-years son and my 65-years mom.<br/><br/>The flat has everything you need inside. All the commodities are in place.<br/>What might be not so good is that entrance door is pretty thin and there is a space between the door and the floor that allows even slight noise to penetrate to the apartment.<br/><br/>We didn't cook - but if you want to, be ready that the kitchen is not so big.<br/><br/>But those are the things that can't spoil overall great experience of staying at Athens."

We had a flight delay and only arrived in the middle of the night but Thalia and her sister kept in contact with us throughout and even waited for us personally for the check in process. We were extremely thankful for their warm hospitality. <br/><br/>Thalia’s apartment is close to all the attractions and the metro is very near by. <br/><br/>Overall, we had a great stay at Thalia’s apartment and would definitely stay here again if we return to Athens."

21826094,418498411118750522,2021-07-31,9364732,Sophy,"Great flat!! The location is extremely convenient, both for the neighbourhood restaurants & shops (esp. Plateia Proskopon) and for the centre of town (walk through the National Gardens or metro), plus there's a direct bus to the archaeological museum, Plateia Viktoria, etc. Thaleia and her sister are delightful and couldn't have been more helpful. As you'd expect at the price, it's kind of basic - the kitchen was fine for breakfast etc, but you wouldn't want to cook anything complex, the a/c isn't hugely powerful (though I was there in July and it was fine), etc. But everything works, and it's a nice space. The view is onto an internal courtyard, which isn't particularly pretty, but it is quiet. And the location is great!!"
21826094,462048419978204936,2021-09-29,55249578,Tanya,"The flat is in the perfect location, and while the kitchen is small, with a bit of creativity re utensils and recipes, it's perfectly possible to cook in it. The hosts were really nice, and when there was a problem that resulted in an electrician coming out to do some rewiring, they were really great at staying in touch and following up. Some reviews mentioned the AC not being strong enough, but I found it worked well."

Everything you need for a comfortable stay for a great price in Athens. <br/><br/>Not located in the best area of Athens - but the street is quiet and lovely, and I felt safe though wasn't out at night. But if you can get past the unglamorous area then it's convenient - 10 mins walk to Metro and only a few stops to main sights of the city. <br/><br/>Lots of hip bars and restaurants in the area, I found a great patisserie nearby, and grocery store close. Local Greek restaurant right next door. <br/><br/>Sound does travel in the apartment building as it's old, but not too bad. I really enjoyed my stay here - very helpful hosts who too care of me. <br/><br/>Also sparklingly clean and all amenities provided, and good wifi."

The apartment is big and with a lot of light. The street is quite so no problems with night noise! The area is not fancy and glamorous but very ok, do not be scared of first impression :) The communication with Dimitra and Marina were perfect! and if you looking for a longer stay that is the right spot!"

21831529,238596779,2018-02-26,5208895,Kate,"It was a larger group of us travelling this time around: 5 adults and a 2 years old and we stayed one week in Athens. The communication was the best we have had to date - Dimitros was just super fast and helpful with all our questions. The apartment: it looks exactly as seen on the photos, which is great. It also has two big balconies, which are not on the photos - so it is nice to have a bit of outdoor space. The building has two elevators, so there is step free/buggy friendly access. Each room has an air conditioner as well and everything is in great condition. The flat was big enough for all of us and we could all comfortably sit around the table and the living room. We had some evenings eating in and cooking - and every morning we had breakfast at the apartment. Dimitros was super fast at providing us with a hoover (as we went with a toddler we needed to clean up after each meal) and he also got a brand new coffee machine (of which we made a good use of). They also provided us with a cot - which was a big bonus for us. I would say you can nicely fit in about 6-8 people without it being overcrowded. The location: perfect. We did quite a bit of walking to just discover all the areas. You can easily walk to Omonia square in about 15 minutes, Syntagma is about 30 minutes walk and there are two metro stations within 5 minutes walk as well, so really central (but local) location. Larissa Station is just at the end of the street and there is a huge supermarket just before the station, so we did most of our shopping there. Victoria station is in the opposite direction just a few minutes away. Suggestions for the host: A toaster and a manual for the air conditioning:) Suggestions for anyone thinking of booking this place: do it! The flat is great location, well equipped, lovely host and top-notch communication. For eating out and coffees and other bits: We did lots of walking around and ate in various restaurants, so if we had to recommend we would recommend: Kerameikos (A little taste of Home is brilliant), Psiri (Cinque Wine bar and Nancy's dessert) and try the escape rooms - we have done Escapepolis and it was epic! Last but not least: The Greek are very friendly with kids, however, a lot of the places are not exactly buggy or baby friendly. The Acropolis has it's own buggy check in, so you can only walk up without a pushchair (which was fine for us actually). The pavements are not brilliant either, but we managed fine with our Yoyo. If you are in Athens and you have a child under the age of 4, you must go to the seaside to the Flisvos Park (Tram 4) as it has the best playground ever with 12..."

The bed sheets and towels provided were clean and of good quality. We had a pleasant stay. The area is also great- we could cheap coffee, orange juice and pastries just a few minutes walk from the flat. There are many supermarkets around too. However, we all find that the flat could have been cleaner. The floor was dusty and since we were travelling with kids, this was something important for us. However, Dimitrios provided us with a vacuum cleaner when we requested for it. Thanks for the stay !"

Bathroom had a contemporary look but you must bring your own laundry detergent.  The host is very responsive to email (within a few minutes or hours) and helpful.  He speaks English well."

All were very comfortable. Clean white linens and towels. Air conditioning in all rooms. You can close the windows, because there is a noisy road under the window. The kitchen has all utensils, spices, oil, tea, coffee, sugar."
21831529,328716067,2018-09-27,111626805,Liz,This place fit 10 of us very comfortably. Dimitrios was a fantastic host and answered all of my questions. He was extremely kind and helpful. The location is perfect to hop over to town or walk and grab some good food to eat. It was sparkling clean. I highly reccomend this place for your next Athens trip.

The metro is near and in 2 stations you are in the middle of athens. The communication is easy and very quick, dimitrios is helpful and friendly. Kathy helped us without making any problems as we forgot the keys inside, many many thanks for everything. You made our holidays unforgettable."

I ragazzi ovviamente hanno apprezzato tantissimo la ‘game room’ con la Playstation, mentre noi adulti abbiamo utilizzato molto la cucina perfettamente attrezzata e la grande TV nel soggiorno (con Netflix e Prime Video).<br/>La posizione, a pochi passi dalla stazione Metro ‘Victoria’, ci ha permesso di muoverci con facilità per Atene. Nella zona troverete negozi per tutto il necessario (market, panetterie, farmacie, ecc…). <br/>Kosmas, il nostro riferimento come host, è stato perfetto: sempre disponibile e gentile, ha risposto prontamente a tutte le nostre richieste.<br/>Consigliatissimo.

21831529,357418113,2018-12-10,56676306,Samantha,"This home is impeccably furnished and was so much more than what we expected. The hosts were extremely accommodating and came to the home to help us figure out the heating when we struggled with controlling it and when we had an issue with one of the guests in our party getting locked in the apartment -- they were just generally extremely helpful for every single issue or question we had during our multi-day stay in Athens, and it made our first time in Athens quite memorable. The home is conveniently located, and the hosts are full of recommendations for nearby attractions and food stops!"

We were a group of ten people and we didn't feel any discomfort or a lack of space. We very enjoyed to spend  evenings together with some company games. The owner was very friendly and heplful.<br/><br/>The appartment is located in the center and very close to some museums and metro station. The only imperfection of this allocation is neghbourhood. Even though it is in the center of Athens, there were demonstarions on nearby streets and we felt unsafety. But we didn't met any hostility from anyone. I hope it was just temporary problem and ussually it is more quite neighbourhood."
21831529,406075475,2019-01-28,20983125,Marketa,"We really enjoyed staying at Marios’ apartment. The place is comfy, clean and very spacious. We were a group of 11- the apartment never felt overcrowded, though. A huge plus,  especially for bigger groups are the 3 bathrooms. The location is very central- shops,bars, restaurants are a quick walk away. The sightseeing spots are easy accessible by metro which is 5 minutes away from the apartment. <br/>Marios is a kind person and an excellent host. He welcomed us at the apartment and had very helpful tips and recommendations. He even arranged an earlier check in! The communication was immediate and easy at all times. <br/>We definitely would stay again at Marios’ place. Very recommended.<br/>Thanks for everything!"

Sie kümmern sich unverzüglich um jedes Anliegen und antworten selbst zu später Abendstunde. Alle zuständigen Ansprechpartner sind sehr freundlich und äusserst zuvorkommend. Sie handeln und unterstützen sofort, um Ihren Gästen den Aufenthalt so angenehm wie möglich zu machen. Die Unterkunft beinhaltet eine top Service- und Ratgeberleistung für jegliche Frage vor Ort und sorgt somit für ein hervorragendes Wohlbefinden. <br/>Wer sich mit Taxi fortbewegen möchte, dem empfehle ich, sich die Uber App herunterzuladen. Nicht jedes Taxi in Athen hat ein Navi und somit umgeht man unnötige Diskussionen oder fehlendes Wechselgeld. Besonders empfehlenswert für diejenigen, die weder Englisch noch Griechisch sprechen können.<br/>Passt auf der Straße auf euer Gepäck und eure Handtaschen auf, es sind einige Taschendiebe in Athen unterwegs."

We were 6 adults and 4 children and quite frankly it was amazing.<br/>Just a few minutes away from the metro station although one can easily walk into town. <br/>The hosts Kosmas and Kostas were wonderful, always checking on us to make sure we don’t need anything. <br/>I highly recommend this apartment."

The hosts were incredibly responsive and helpful - we couldn’t have asked for better. They took our luggage in when we arrived since check in was still a few hours away and they managed to check us in a bit early, despite not thinking they would be able to. I would absolutely recommend this place and these hosts to anyone coming to Athens."

It’s not located in the nicest neighborhood of Athens, but the metro is very close and we always felt safe. <br/>The apartment has a nice little kitchen which is great for making breakfast, but you probably shouldn’t bother making dinner at home for 9+ people since food is relatively cheap and the kitchen is quite small.<br/>Every single room has it’s own AC, there are two separate bathrooms with a shower + another toilet. <br/>I can’t find anything to seriously complain about, especially for this price! Would definitely recommend."

It is with Netflix and TV in every room and everyone of us can enjoy the entertainment. Also, there is a PS4 made us feel like home. Since it sounds not safe to stay late in Athens, we spent time in the apartment and we enjoyed our stay. Also, the host is very caring and he gave us a call to make sure we are not safe to the apartment. Therefore, I recommended this apartment!"

21831529,537265894,2019-09-28,25079363,Paul & Sherry,This was a great find! Plenty of space and beds and bedrooms! They provide the frothers to make frappes so that was nice. Everything is so clean and nice. We even played PlayStation in one of the living rooms. There was a TV in every room and even an office. WiFi worked excellently. Hosts met us upon check in and was so sweet. They even helped us to arrange transportation to and from the Airbnb. Surrounding streets seem a little bit shady especially at night but it is 15-20min walk from the flea market downtown cheap shopping. We had a great time! The beds were pretty stiff but otherwise we had a good stay.

21831529,546031003,2019-10-13,260111605,Pim,"We have stayed at the apartment during a weekend in Athens with 5 friends. Before our stay, the communication with our host Victoria was very good: she replied quickly to any questions and gave us some advice about places to visit. <br/><br/>The apartment looks as impeccable as on the images. It's spacious, modern and very clean.  The shared living room is large enough and very comfortable. There are some nice extra's, such as TV's in every room, a PS4 and a kit to make your own Greek ice coffee. <br/><br/>I do not agree with other reviews stating that the area is unpleasant. Athens looks a bit raw and unpolished in many places, and this street is no exception. I personally think this makes Athens interesting and we never felt unsafe in the neighborhood or anywhere in Athens. Angel's apartment is highly recommended!"
21831529,552203782,2019-10-21,25641238,Patrick,"Appartement is net iets buiten het centrum van het oude stad Athene. Op 10 min afstand met de metro en /of met andere vervoer middelen. Voor zo'n groot appartement met veel bedden ontbreekt er een vaatwasser. Buurt is niet heel veilig, veel zwervers en oogt achterstallig. Evenals de metro aansluiting naar het centrum. Bedden zijn hard. Voorzieningen prima. Ruim appartement met balkon, op elke kamer een tv en een kleine keuken. Airco's aanwezig. Wel aan een drukke weg. Communicatie uitstekend. Taxi geregeld van en naar het vliegveld. Dat is ook een aanrader. Prijs kwaliteit verhouding prima."

Even the sofa can convert to a bed and there are 2 extra pull out beds<br/>- Lots of storage for clothes during your stay<br/>- Plenty of towels for each guest<br/>- About 5 minutes walk from Viktoria Metro Station which has a direct line to port at Piraeus<br/>- Washing machine to use during stay<br/>- Close to lots of small food shops (open daily) and a larger supermarket (not open on a Sunday)<br/>- Lift so that you don’t need to carry heavy suitcases/bags up the stairs <br/>- TVs with Netflix and AirCon in all bedrooms<br/>- Great WiFi <br/>- Playstation room <br/>- Within walking distance (5 minutes) to the National Archeological Museum and Hellenic Motor Museum. About 35 minute walk to the major sites<br/>- Victoria booked us airport transfers in a minivan due to there being 6 of us at a cost of €80 (an approved taxi for 4 people is approx €30-40). The driver was on time and polite. Definitely worth considering if you are in a big party travelling together. <br/><br/>Things to consider before booking:<br/>- Even though the apartment is on the first floor there is quite a lot of traffic noise from the road outside until late at night <br/>- Some of the beds have very firm mattresses <br/>- The apartment is in an area that is a little run down. It is about a 25 walk to Syntagma Square which is considered to be the city centre<br/>- Athens taxi’s can take a maximum of 4 passengers. If there are more guests you will need to take a second taxi. It cost between €4-7 (per taxi) to get back to the apartment from the Thissio Metro Station area"

Les lits sont confortables et il y a 5 grandes chambres et une sixième plus petite. Il manquait quelques équipements de cuisine, mais l'agence a été aussitôt très réactive et les a apportés. <br/>L'appartement est près du centre et il y a un supermarché et une boulangerie tout près. Seule ombre au tableau, le caractère bruyant ( beaucoup de passage de voitures) de la rue sur laquelle donne l'appartement. <br/>Nous avons passé un agréable séjour chez Kathy. Merci à elle."

From Netflix's, to TV's in every room, to water dispenser and many other features. The apartment has great spaces and very usable spaces. The only negative was it is quite noisy but that is what you get when you stay in the inner city. I give this property a big thumbs up"

Everything was clean, the rooms are spacious & the living areas great for a large group like us who spent the evenings chatting and having some drinks. You can easily walk to the Acropolis and the other monuments (or take the metro if you prefer), or to Lycabettus Hill to enjoy the sunset. The place is close to the National Archeological Museum. The comunication was great, our host offered us great restaurant recommendations and helped us find the best way to get to the airport in time when we left."

The place was very clean. We had everything we needed. My family of 12 was very comfortable. The host Victoria was phenomenal. She answered every question we had. She arranged our transportation. She even had someone come to the apartment to due our covid testing and brought out results back to us. I recommend this place.  Even if I don't go with a large group I would still stay there.

21832689,232102385,2018-02-04,4096595,Despo,"I made a same day reservation for Toni's studio and his response was extremely prompt and he made my later arrival on that day not troubleshooting at all. Toni's studio is newly refurbished, extremely clean and spacious. I loved the mattress and nespresso! The location is very central and the local transportation in the neighborhood is superb but at night time I would recommend that you do not walk alone and preferably take a taxi. I would choose one of Toni's places for my next visit in Athens. Definitely recommended."

Lovely host and quick responses. The only downside is the hot water: You have to wait for 25 minutes to heat before you can use it (and even then, it didn't seem to work perfectly all the time). All in all, I would highly recommend this place."

Die Wohnung entspricht den wunderschönen Bildern und hat unsere Erwartungen absolut erfüllt.<br/>Die Lage war echt praktisch. Wir konnten viele Sehenswürdigkeiten, wie die Agora, Akropolis oder den Philopappos Hügel zu Fuß erreichen. Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind in unmittelbarer Nähe und waren praktisch um zum Hafen oder Flughafen zu gelangen. Und ein Supermarkt war gleich ums Eck. <br/>Insgesamt hatte wir einen tollen Aufenthalt, vor allem weil die Kommunikation mit dem Team von Tony super funktionierte. Auch die späte Ankunft um 1 in der Früh war absolut kein Problem.<br/>Wir hatten einen super Urlaub und würden die Wohnung nochmals buchen "

He was quick to respond, provided detailed information about transportation/local activities and the place was clean, modern and equipped with everything we needed for a 2 night stay.

21832689,263070597,2018-05-11,182208957,Andy,"Toni was really helpful. Although I forgot to inform him about my time of arrival, so he did not pre-prepared for my early arrival, he rushed everything to make sure I can check-in asap. He promised 3pm for check-in but around 1.30pm his staff already called saying that the room could be ready by 2pm. In addition, he went further, extending his help for my luggage to be placed in his office as the second day we have late flight, so we need a place to put our luggage. Everything else is also fantastic, multiple facilities, iron, tv, coffee machine. Everything is so fantastic. There are also good bathing soaps which is a local brand, Korres, of ultimate quality."

It was exactly what we expected through the pictures. <br/><br/>Little trouble with the building door when we arrived since we found ourselves locked outside at 2am, had to find a solution and finally came in thanks to a doorman with no real excuses from Toni that would have been really appreciated. <br/><br/>Except for this trouble communication was really good with Toni before & after the stay. "
21832689,300385753,2018-08-02,21012270,Gillian,"We stayed at Toni's in August. Athens was sweltering, Toni's was like an oasis. We felt so lucky to find such a place to stay. Amazing communication from the host both before and upon arrival. The apartment was amazing, it was like having our own private, nicely renovated, air conditioned studio. A friend of ours who was staying in a hotel came by and was jealous she had not found Toni's herself. It really is a gem, we would book it again. Thanks Toni!"

Accommodation was very clean and modern and location was about a 15 minute walk to the everything we needed .  <br/><br/>Toni was very organised with the check in and even though our time differed to what was initially organised , we met as soon as we arrived.

The area isn't the  best, so be prepared to take extra care with your belongings on the street (however this is pretty widespread in most capital cities and especially Athens). would definitely stay again "

Tip we did a free tour by This is my Athens  - locals who showed us how nice Athens is rather than being lost or getting too caught up in the touristy areas."

21832689,332416185,2018-10-05,6632720,Susann,"Tonis Apartment ist recht zentral gelegen. Die Wohnung selbst befindet sich in einem unauffälligen Wohnhaus, aber ist ein echtes Träumchen! Alles modern und stilvoll eingerichtet. Die Dusche ist perfekt, das Bett super-bequem und die Küche hat auch alles, was man braucht. Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt. Ich empfehle Tonis Apartment uneingeschränkt! Es ist eine kleine Ruhe-Oase im trubeligen Athen."

It is very beautiful and new and you get everything you need: towels, hair dryer, a good equipped kitchen etc. <br/>Especially the tips for Athene from the staff were really good! <br/>The only thing which was not perfect - but thats not Tonis fault - the area is a bit scarry at night, I wouldn‘t want to walk there alone as a girl. But it is very central and at day everything is ok!"
21832689,335084708,2018-10-11,202473010,James,Being my first time going abroad this trip was beyond any expectations I had. I was running late for my check-in but one of Toni’s friends stayed to greet me. She explained clearly how everything worked and gave me suggestions of where to go and what to see! The flat was spotless and an outstanding value for money. HIGHLY RECOMMEND (especially for first time travellers).
21832689,337408929,2018-10-16,46342497,Kelsey,The room was so nice and cozy we had a hard time getting out and exploring the city.

Precious gems in the centre of Athens, lovely city."
21832689,348304579,2018-11-13,19784271,Alison,"Fabulous value for money.  Never judge a book by its cover ... the flat is as pics show, and very clean, and brand new.  Yes, the area is down at heel, but Athens needs all the support it can get to kick start its economy.  Take full advantage of the area, and go over to Excharchia, and eat out like a local. Cheap and fab.  The flat is close to the Metro station, but we never used it.  Walked everywhere, apart from the tour bus, which stops just one block away.  Appreciated the swift response on feedback to when we had any query. Nice workforce."
21832689,349817804,2018-11-18,8950293,Uwe,"Do not travel on November 17th due to risky demonstrations very close to the apartment. Every year. <br/>Also, be aware of house parties next to the apartment after 11 pm!!!"

The apartment was very clean and spacious, check in was super easy as well as the communication. <br/>Areas like Exarchia and Monastiráki are close so you have restaurants etc in walking distance. <br/>Only the area the apartment is located in is not the nicest. Nevertheless, I would totally recommend staying at this place."
21832689,357420378,2018-12-10,150010990,Erica,"We had an awesome time at Toni's place. He was the perfect host: we got lots of information about the appartement and the area (which was given on a very professional way), the appartement looked even better in real life, Toni's team was able and willing to help us when we had a problem (that we caused ourselves) and the venue was really equipped. The location was good, so was the bed and the shower :). It was clean and quiet. We would definetely reccoment others to stay at Toni's appartement!"

The location is also great. You have a metro station near the apartment, but you can easily reach everything in the center by foot. There are many supermarkets, restaurants and other shops in the area. I'll definitely be his guest again."

But also, if you are careful, taking care of you and your stuff, nothing bad will happen. Toni and his co-workers are super quick with responding, very nice and helpful. Nothing bad to say. Anyhow, i would recommend Toni and his apartment."
21832689,456734506,2019-05-22,43304137,Khanty & Aya,"I strongly recommend Toni’s place! I like the location it’s close to metro and walking distance to all the tourists hot spots and ancient ruins. Toni’s place is ideal for those travellers who loves to wander and walk everywhere. Restaurants, local bars and groceries store was easily accessible within walking distance, very convenient!  <br/>A big plus is the cleanliness of the apartment! The bathroom, kitchen and bedroom spotless and clean. Very quiet and safe neighbourhood even though quite centrally located. <br/>Toni’s team are quick to respond to any questions and suggestions. Exceptional place and host I recommend Toni’s place to all travellers who plan to visit Athens."

21832689,473263976,2019-06-21,68972307,Alexandre,"L’appartement est parfait pour un couple (voir un couple et un enfant grâce au couchage supplémentaire).<br/>Le lit est confortable, la douche et la climatisation fonctionnent très bien. l’appartement possède même une machine à laver. Il n’y a rien à redire sur l’appartement.<br/><br/>Le seul point regrettable est l’emplacement. L’appartement se situe à 10min de marche au nord de la station de métro Omonia et à 20/25min à pied de la place Monistriaki. <br/>Le quartier n’est pas très agréable de nuit. Ma copine s’est faite dévisager et reluquer à de nombreuses reprises sur le chemin. <br/>Cependant, nous n’avons eu aucune nuisance sonore ou d’un autre ordre.<br/><br/>Merci à Toni pour sa réactivité et son accueil. Notre avion a eu du retard et nous l’avons fait attendre devant l’appartement presque une heure."

El edificio necesita mejoras pero eso no influyó en nada la excelente calidad del departamento y nuestro descanso. <br/>El barrio tiene un supermercado a media cuadra y el metro está a unas 4 cuadras y si bien el entorno del barrio llama la atención por lo oscuro y descuidado de la calle, finamente resultó ser muy tranquilo.<br/><br/>Volvería ahí sin duda!"

21832689,484598880,2019-07-09,874224,Sabine(Gen),"Toni's place was right next to the bus and a 7 minute walk from metro. If you like walking, it's about 16 mins to city centre and 5mins by taxi traffic permitting. Athens is very alive at night, so having an accommodation that I could get to easily was a great plus. It's far enough that the neighborhood is quiet. Spent time on the balcony just relaxing. They connected me with a taxi to get to the airport by 5:30 and the price was better than any other companies offer. Overall great value for the price. Woukd stay here again."
21832689,487734977,2019-07-14,23974713,Noor,Toni's place was great highly recommended. The neighborhood however was kinda weird at night so we did not feel comfortable walking there. Overall our stay was nice and we enjoyed it a lot

21832689,511270459,2019-08-17,152445002,Yevhenii,"Incredible apartments, very stylish, clean, good location, it’s close to the most number of attractions and locations, everything is well organized and comfortable. Very useful option with late check in. Toni provided all the possible ways how to get to the apartments and it’s really easy to do. But as I arrived too late, Toni has organized pick up service and driver was waiting me at the airport.<br/>Awesome host, I will definitely choose him again during my next Athens holiday."

21832689,529029867,2019-09-14,243005283,Lorainne,"The apartment was great. It was not noisy at all. The guy that checked us in answered all of our questions and was very helpful. Now, I know the neighborhood looks a little scary, but we did not have any problems at all. Everyone was very nice. Rozalia's is an AMAZING restaurant. The roasted lamb was beyond heavenly. Trust me, just do it. The closest hop on/hop off tour bus stop was at the Archaeology Museum. It is about 2 streets away. There is a ticket package you can purchase at the Temple of Zeus that will save you money at the attractions. Spend the 38 euros for the private car service to the airport. The bus system and subway system is not easy to navigate especially if you do not speak the language."
21832689,529643219,2019-09-15,977533,Brenda,Toni was so helpful letting us stay last minute after our ferry got canceled. The space is very clean and spacious and exactly what we needed. Thank you!

21832689,558504974,2019-11-03,302621792,Enrique,"Toni's is a great place to stay at. If you, as we did, spend all they long walking around, you'll have the peace of mind of leaving your belongings in a very secured place and of returning at night to a safe, clean, quiet place. If you want to spend more time at the apartment you'll find everything you need (all the amenities, including a good washing machine and plenty of space). We just felt we could move in and live at Toni's apartment if we were to stay in Athens (we wished we could). It's a great location, also. You can find anything you need nearby and it's easy to walk or use public transportation to the main sites in Athens. We did not meet Toni in person, but every time we had a question or a request, he would answer immediately and always to our satisfaction."

We were a party of 4 and were very comfortable with the size. Just steps from Plaka and Acropolis station, the experience is perfect. We rented a car and had no trouble finding the centrally located place and we found parking within 1 block every time we returned. This is for sure one of the best AirBnBs we’ve staying in!"

Ioanna è stata una host eccezionale, il bagno e la cucina erano fornitissimi: dal bagnoschiuma alla crema corpo, al colluttorio, dalla frutta al caffè, alle bottiglie d'acqua da bere. Siamo stati accolti con simpatia e cordialità; Ioanna ha sempre risposto rapidamente a tutte le nostre richieste dimostrandoci premura, attenzione e disponibilità. Appartamento consigliatissimo.

21834678,529095615,2019-09-14,43327113,Winnie,"I love how cosy and stylish Ioanna has decorated her apartment. She is also very thoughtful to add in the amenities in the bathroom like cotton, mouthwash, sanitary pads, etc. <br/><br/>The kitchen is also very equipped with pots and pans. Basic cooking needs like oil, salt, pepper and some spices. <br/><br/>If you like to use her washer, she provides washing powder for you.<br/><br/>We decided to get the metro to her place. The pavements are not the friendliest for travellers with large luggage. Do bear in mind if you have more than 1 luggage each person, you may want to get the taxi. <br/><br/>Overall we had a great stay at Ioanna :)"

21834678,533735188,2019-09-22,43695770,Florian,"The place was just as stylish and clean as shown in the pictures and very well equipped. The location is perfect with many of the most popular sightseeing attractions like the Akropolis in walking distance. Ioanna herself was a great host, waiting for us to check-in, even though our flight was delayed. Also, she was always easy and quick to contact and very helpful in recommending local attractions and restaurants. All in all, we had a great stay and would totally come again!"

21834678,544933067,2019-10-11,1190769,Emma,"We are so grad that we chose Ioanna’s apartment. It is very clean and stylish, everything looks very new and modern. Even more prettier than the pictures. The apartment is very good located, downstairs there’s restaurants, bus stop, supermarket and pharmacy. Other Public transportations like metro, tram are also near the apartment, 5min max by walk. All the attractions can arrive by walking. <br/>Ioanna is very helpful and warm-hearted. She has everything perfectly prepared before we came. My daughters were very happy for the welcome gifts. <br/>Conclusion:<br/>1.  Apartment is very recommended. <br/>2. Don’t hesitate to ask Ioanna, she responds always quickly.<br/>3. Pls take a walk than taking transportations. <br/>4. Pls take care of your belongings when you are in the city."

21834678,550617615,2019-10-19,17196961,Ugne,"Very good place! Comfortable, spacious, has so many thoughtful touches to it - from mouthwash to a sewing kit and laundry! It's the perfect home feel :).  It is next to a fairly loudish street regarding traffic (though to expect total car silence in Athens is a little naive), but the sound isolation of the balcony is quite good. Overall, I would very highly recommend Ioanna's place and wish that every AirBnB was so full of these little touches as hers. Efcharisto!"
21834678,553399048,2019-10-24,38078990,Tineke,"We had a wonderful time at Ioanna's apartment in the centre of Athens with our two daughters (11 and 9 years old). The apartment was very complete and had everything we needed. It is spacious and comfortable. Ioanna added lots of nice details to the apartment which made us feel very welcome. It really was a home away from home where we could relax after a day well spent.<br/><br/>Across the street from the apartment is a supermarkt. Also, there are a lot of other shops and restaurants nearby, like a bakery for fresh bread in the morning, an affordable Greek restaurant for diner or lunch and an ice-cream shop for the kids.<br/><br/>We walked with our kids to the Acropolis. For sightseeing a little bit further away we used the metro. There is a metrostation (red line, Sigrou-Fix) close to the apartment. When we went to the beach we walked approximately 10 minutes to the tram which took us straight to the coast.<br/><br/>If we come back some other time to Athens we will definitely want to stay here again!"
21834678,556328044,2019-10-29,120403194,Nathalie,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour dans cet appartement.<br/>Les photos sont conformes à la réalité, même si la cuisine et le séjour sont plus sombres en réalité car sans ouvertures vers l'extérieur.<br/>Les lits sont vraiment très confortables.<br/>L'équipement est complet, avec de nombreux accessoires appréciables dans la salle de bain.<br/>La communication avec Ioanna a été très facile, même si nous ne l'avons pas rencontrée."
21834678,558486538,2019-11-03,147872240,Waad,"To start with, Ioanna is the nicest person ever, very fast in responding the messages and all the requests. She gave us early check in and late check out. And she talks english very well which makes the communication very easy. She helped us during our stay. Ioanna’s place is the best place where you can stay in Athens. Near the metro station 4 min walking, you can go to the acropolis 10 min walking or 1 metro stop, very close to the shopping stores, restaurants, pubs. There are Supermarkets and pharmacies facing the building and a bus stop as well. The place is very clean and full of amenities that you will be surprised to find (make up removal, tooth brush, tooth floss, cue tips, hygienic wet wipes.....) the apartment is fully equipped. We enjoyed our stay in Athens and in Ioanna’s place and we will surely book it again once we go back to Athens. <br/>Thank you Ioanna for everything and for all the efforts that you made to make our stay perfect. I wish you good luck ❤️"

21834678,647148575,2020-08-06,37158405,Simon,This apartment proved the perfect place for a first visit to Athens as a family. We were able to walk to all the key attractions without public transport.

Aircon too is great and  in August is a must to help sleep! <br/><br/>It's in a great location, only a few minutes walk from the Acropolis.  We really enjoyed walking around Plaka and Monasteraki and of course visiting the monuments. All can be done on foot from the apartment. Just caution on the metro, we were pickpocketed at Syntagma when we arrived from the airport  which was not a great start."

It is in a quiet neighborhood with everything you need within walking distance. There is a grocery store directly across the street, a laundromat directly next door (although the apartment has a great washer so the laundromat isn’t necessary), and lots of excellent restaurants around. It is a short 5-minute walk to the metro and was the perfect location for us. We will certainly stay here again next time we are in Athens!"

It is near the acropolis but just as importantly it is in a great neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and cafés that don't feel touristy considering their proximity to such a major tourist attraction.  The apartment itself is clean and comfortable.  The A/Cs and laundry came in particularly handy as it was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit during out stay.  Would recommend!

She's very responsive to messages and even checked in during our stay to make sure we were okay. The area is within walking distance to all of the main tourist attractions. Right down the street is a promenade with many restaurants the locals hand out at, which was great! It's also right across the street from a market and next door to a laundry mat, which came in handy. The apartment itself was really clean and just as described.

Everything that you could think is at walking distance: touristical atractions, restaurants, shopping area, souvenirs, etc! <br/>Even though we were a bit suspicious in the begining, because the apartment did not have reviews it proved out to be the best accomodation that we could get. <br/>Even for a longer stay, you have everything that you need:utilities for cooking, small and cute little shampoo, shower gel, etc towels, hair dryier, washing machine, iron, etc.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend staying at Adam & Christina's apartment. <br/>PS: some small attention from our host awaited for us when we checked in, proving once again how wonderful people they are :)!"

It is also few hundred meters from station with direct metro and bus connection to the Airport. Even though it is near all the happening places, it was surprisingly quiet so we could have a good night sleep. We arrived to Athens after midnight and were happy we could check-in so late.

And an extra-early check-in after night flight really saved me the first day of trip. <br/><br/>Flat is in brilliant location -- 100 meters from Syntagma square and metro station joining two metro lines, with direct metro connection to airport (X95 bus stop to/from airport is also right across the square), 300 meters from the Parliament. Building is situated at picturesque and very central (thus busy) pedestrian street, but the flat is located in the inner part of building and thus is surprisingly quiet, no street noise at all. The only minor minus is that there's no exciting view from windows :D but indeed no need in it, because the charming Athens should be walked and explored, not looked at from windows :D<br/><br/>Good supermarket (Bazaar) is in several minutes of walking. Right the corner is 24-h McDonalds which really helps those who prefer night life :D Try Greek Mac there! <br/><br/>The flat is clean and has all needed for comfortable stay, including iron, microwave oven, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, excellent experience. Ευχαριστω πολι, Christina and Adam! :)"

21847866,409965151,2019-02-09,2530176,Sabena,"Adam & Christina's place was great.  Like all the other reviews already said, the location was perfect, walking distance to all with lots of eating places around the apartment.  The apartment is facing the back and therefore super quiet for sleeping.  Highly recommended."
21847866,411414461,2019-02-12,105083879,Casey,"Great location and a wonderful apartment to use as a home base in Athens! We could easily come back to rest in the afternoon before going back out in the evening, and major attractions were just minutes away. Adam and Christina were prompt with their responses and check-in and check-out both went smoothly. The tea and coffee were also appreciated, as were the individual toiletries for each guest!"

Au cœur d’un quartier dynamique. <br/>Christina s’est montrée bienveillante, du café, du the et des produits d’hygiènes mis à disposition  pour le confort de chacun.

21847866,418501464,2019-03-02,20749816,Lena,"Lägenheten ligger väldigt centralt, ett par minuters promenad från metrostationen och torget  Syntagma på en gågata där det myllrar av folk. Trots det centrala läget är det knäpptyst i lägenheten som ligger inåt gården och utan utsikt. Sängen är verkligen skön ovh likaså kuddarna och täcket. Jag sov bättre än hemma. I köket finns en kaffekokare och det bjuds på bryggkaffe vilket jag uppskattade mycket. Badrummet är litet men duschen varm och skön och det fanns tvål, schampo och balsam att tillgå. Lägenheten var väldigt ren. Kommunikationen med Adam & Christina var snabb och enkel och jag möttes av deras assistent som gav mig nycklar och när jag åkte så lämnade jag dem bara på bordet. Jag skulle definitivt bo här i igen . Det enda jag har att anmärka på var att wi-fi-uppkopplingen var lite svajig."

Some very little disadvantages for us were dark shower curtain and windows opening onto airshafts. But in general good value for money.

21847866,443123127,2019-04-25,144406630,Kushay,Christina and Adam are great host. The communication and navigation to reach the house was quite prompt and helpfull.<br/><br/>The house is perfectly placed at Syntagma square making it very convinient to access the bus or train. Travelling to and fro from airport was very convinient due to its location.<br/><br/>The only drawback which I faced was there was no toilet flush which I found it very surprising and shocked as I have never come across something like this before or may be it had censor before which was not working. It was extremely inconvinient in the toilet.<br/><br/>Rest I think it a great place and great location to choose

We flew into Athens late, had the next day to explore the city, then caught the ferry the following morning.  For one day in the city we were able to see everything we wanted to, eat at amazing restaurants, and explore easily on foot.  The location is absolutely perfect.  Also extremely easy to access from the airport or the ferry port.<br/><br/>Aside from the location, the apartment itself is spacious, comfortable, and clean.  My wife and I were both shocked at how it could possibly be in the heart of a major city, yet completely quiet at night.<br/><br/>Add to all of this a very friendly, accommodating, and responsive host and you've got a 10/10 Air BnB.  100% recommend this place and if I'm ever in Athens again, I'll definitely be back."

До Акрополя пешком минут 15. Квартира на шумной улице, но как только в подъезд заходишь, наступает почти мертвая тишина. В доме окна во двор, закрыты жалюзи. В квартире чисто, кухня с гостиной совмещены и достаточно большие. Душ маленький, но удобный, только не хватило держателя на стенке, чтобы можно было повесить смеситель. Замечательное спальное место. Надо купить себе такой же матрас и одеяла - отдыхаешь точно.) Зимой включаешь обогреватель - мощный и быстрый. В спальне сразу тепло. Посуды немного, есть кофеварка, чайник и тп. Интернет не всегда сильный, но в Греции это распространённая проблема."

On a voyagé avec un petit de 2 ans et demie alors c’était sympa de pouvoir revenir à l’appart à midi pour qu’il puisse faire sa sieste ou simplement se reposer... <br/>L’appart est situé vraiment en plein centre, dans une rue commerciale principale mais on a eu aucun bruit de l’extérieur,  même pas des voisins de l’immeuble...<br/>À 2 mn à pied de la place Syntagma où on prenait notre bus touristique tous les jours ou d’où on a pris le bus pour aller à l’aéroport...<br/>L’appart est plus petit de ce qu’on voit sur les photos mais ça nous a pas dérangé.  Même pas le fait qu’il y ait pas trop de lumière de l’extérieur .... on était là pratiquement que pour dormir, alors ça nous a pas dérangé non plus. <br/>Il était bien pour un séjour de 3 jours, propre, jolie, proche à tout!, <br/>Si je dois mettre un petit bémol  ça serait le frigo qui faisait trop de bruit... chaque certain temps (30 mn à peu près... et oui on a compté les minutes) il faisait du bruit qui laissait pas trop se détendre au petit mais je suppose que si un adulte dort au salon ça dérangerait peut être pas plus que ça."

The area is  one of the best shopping places in the city and the street itself, is a pedestrian only street for several blocks in either direction. There are many great choices of restaurants, a favorite coffee cafe to casual and upscale dining. The location is within walking distance to the Acropolis, museums, Ancient Agora and the Plaka district. The apartment is comfortable, SAFE, well equipped and quiet,  even with the busy street and night life. I hope to return to Athens and will definitely want to stay here again."

21861935,227521724,2018-01-15,10692466,Abigail,"The apartment itself is clean modern and nice. However we left disappointed and actually angry at this point. This apartment was our first in Europe. Upon arrival the host was not available and sent his friend. After he orientated us on the house we asked about the hot tub before we left. He said that Peter our host would tell us about it the following day and brushed it off. We were only staying there two days so that’s the first day we couldn’t use it. I never saw Peter. For a two day stay they only left four towels total with no more accessible since Peter never showed. Back to the hot tub. The second and last night we went to use the hot tub. It was warm. As soon as we got in we noticed our eyes burning immensely!! We started choking. Then within minutes skin was on fire. The hot tub was full of bleach!! Who puts bleach in a hot tub? we got out and all our bathing suits were ruined as well as clothing we put on to walk back downstairs. For days afterwards we have peeling skin, bleach smell on our hands and we are very upset. I’ve never heard of anyone using straight and very high levels of bleach in the hot tub. We always use chlorine. This is absurd."

It was very clean and very centrally located. Transportation to/from the airport was incredibly easy and Kostas sent very easy instructions to follow. Communication was great from the host and we were welcomed with amazing hospitality and someone was always available to answer our questions. We did have some problems with the jacuzzi heating up so we were bummed about that, but the rooftop view is beautiful."

The place was neat and clean as the photos show, very well located with only a 3 minute walk to station, which in turn takes another 4 minutes to reach the centre. <br/>The decoration of the unit is very modern, new furniture and great amenities available. Highly secured and safe. TV had good satellite and we were able to watch World Cup matches with live broadcast from the unit.<br/>Rooftop had a nice jacuzzi overlooking the Acropolis.<br/><br/>In short, staying here is money well spent.

If you haven’t been to Athens before, be prepared to be surprised as the neighborhoods change dramatically around every corner. Right across the train tracks from this apartment there is a wonderful up and coming neighborhood with all kinds of great, hip bars and restaurants! If you continue up the road, before you know it you’re at the Acropolis!<br/><br/>The view from the rooftop hot tub was INCREDIBLE!

Η εταιρία που έχει αναλάβει την υποδοχή ήταν αρκετά πιεστική σχετικά με τον ιο,πράγμα κατανοητό μεν ,κουραστικό δε. Το σπίτι ήταν όμορφο αλλά θεωρώ εντελώς παράλογο να νοικιάζεις ένα σπίτι και να μην σου επιτρέπουν να φέρεις ΕΝΑ/ΜΙΑ καλεσμένο/η για μια ώρα! Έχω μείνει άπειρες φορές σε Airbnb και ποτέ ξανά δεν ένιωσα τέτοια πίεση ! Η συνολική μου εμπειρία ήταν κακη."

21861935,704384129,2020-10-27,62224929,Stavros,Στις φωτογραφίες φαίνεται πιο εντυπωσιακό. Σίγουρα θέλει καλύτερη καθαριότητα όπως και διευκρινίσεις σχετικά με τις παροχές καθώς άλλα γράφονται εδώ και άλλα ισχύουν στη πραγματικότητα. Ο χώρος του jacuzzi είναι ωραίος αλλά σε καμία περίπτωση ιδιωτικός όπως με επιβεβαίωσε ο ιδιοκτήτης. Η κουζίνα θέλει καλύτερη οργάνωση και παροχές διότι δεν ανταποκρίνεται στη κατηγορία αυτή. Τέλος το σπίτι χρειάζεται περισσότερη φροντίδα και συντήρηση.

We were in Athens doing IVF treatment so wanted somewhere clean, comfortable and homely. This exceeded all expectations. The place was spotlessly clean, in perfect location - 2 min walk to the metro which is really easy to navigate. Just the right amount of amenities and a reception area with daily cleaning if needed. Everything was perfect and we felt so at home. The jacuzzi was a lovely added bonus which we used every day to unwind. Everything was modern and chic and super clean and tidy. Thank you!

Παμε να μπουμε στο τζακουζι και δεν είχε κάλυμμα από πάνω και είχε σκουπίδια επειδή ήταν σε εξωτερικό χώρο κ δυστυχώς υπήρχαν κ εμφανές τρίχες που ίσως να έπεσαν από τ αλλά διαμερίσματα από τα παράθυρα (ούτε με αφορά από που) κ μας έφεραν απόχη κ για να καθαριστεί......κ τρίτον δεν μπορούσαμε να καλέσουμε κάποιον φίλο ή φίλη να καθίσει μαζί μας επειδή δεν επιτρέπονται εξωτερικοί επισκέπτες λόγω κοβιντ. Δηλαδη αν πλήρωναν ίσως κ να μην υπήρχε πρόβλημα. Κατά τα αλλά ωραιος χώρος στο κέντρο κ η εξυπηρέτηση καλή.

Τζακούζι αρκετά μεγάλο (4 ατόμων ) άμεση ανταπόκριση το κλείσαμε 15 λεπτά πριν φτάσουμε ! Ο οικοδεσπότης πολύ εξυπηρετικός και ευγενικός ότι χρειαζόμασταν του έκανα ένα τηλέφωνο και το λύναμε . Βρίσκεται σε ήσυχο αλλά ταυτόχρονα κεντρικό σημείο στο γκάζι το οποίο είναι και αυτό ένα συν διότι είχαμε κοντά περίπτερα σούπερ μάρκετ ντελίβερι ανοιχτά έως αργά κλπ. Επίσης υπάρχει και ταράτσα στον 5ο όροφο με θέα Ακρόπολη ! Σίγουρα θα ξανά πάμε και θα το προτιμούμε σε φίλους , γνωστούς !"
21861935,749711285,2021-04-18,25107274,Ioanna,Kosta's place is exactly what you see in the photos; a perfectly designed and decorated place! The location and view were spectacular and reception Staff were helpful and willing to recommend.

21861935,755770536,2021-05-07,253076071,Paulos,"Kosta's is a very kind man who treats the guests as he should do. The location is helpful if you want to visit popular areas within Athens and the view from the roof is wonderful and enjoyable. The house was as expected, and the hot tub relaxing.  Definitely recommended to anyone who's looking for a place to stay."
21861935,757438232,2021-05-12,180133690,Nadia,"The place is really nice! very clean. Very polite staff at the reception. Kosta responded fast to all of my message, and was very kind and understanding with my requests. Only thing was that the backyard area is exposed to the rest of the building, so keep in mind that it. has to be quiet in order not to bother the other guests. Hot tub was a nice touch, really relaxing. Overall, really fun experience."

21874640,219281224,2017-12-17,28975624,Bassam,"I was really looking forward to writing this review. The apartment was newly renovated (we were frst people staying there), fantastic design, amazing location (10 min walk to Acropolis).<br/>The amenities were absolutely amazing, you can tell everything was thought out 100%. There was almost nothing more that we could have thought of, the house was asolutely fully equipped. We were so pleasantly surprised when having realized we hadn't brought a phone charger, that even that was thought of, with a charging station providing 3 or 4 different connectors! great touch.<br/>They are professionals and it shows. And for this reason, the only feedback  which I would like to give Homm, which we found as a great plus in another airbnb that we were staying...<br/>Music! having the ability to connect you telephone and stream music withthin room/apartment you are staying at, was great, and always added to the atmosphere. It is something which could be implemented in the properties they are managing.<br/>All the best."
21874640,220201823,2017-12-21,52314039,Rick,"Very responsive and helpful via text and email.  Beautiful, new and comfortable apartment.  We really enjoyed our stay.  Easy walk to Acropolis yet outside the tourist zone, plenty of grocery stores, coffee shops and restaurants within a three block radius.  We felt like, and were welcomed by, the local residents.  Just like we wanted!"

Все сделано очень удобно, продуманы мелочи (например, много зарядных устройств, если вы какой-нибудь провод забыли дома). Есть вся посуда и кухонные принадлежности, постельное белье, полотенца. Квартира удобная, светлая (много ламп, подсветка потолка) и просторная. Окна выходят в тихий двор. Расположение - очень близко к центру (мы не ездили на метро совсем, все в пешей доступности).

Second advantage is that appartaments have everithing  need - wireless internet connection, TV, kitchen tools, soap and so on. And of course, the staff was excellent, answer quickly and informative. Also they shared a couple of useful tips about where to go in Athens<br/>If I ever go in Athens again, I will definitely use their services."

Bathroom very functional. Communication with hosts is direct and prompt. As we got in the appartment we faced up a insignificant technical problem,and even though  we informed the hosts that this was a minor issue for us, and there was no reason to have it fixed   during our stay, they fixed it immediately at the same time!!! Thank you homm!"

Even there are computer, that can be used. <br/>The situation of the apartment is nice. It is close to the historical places, on walking distance, but not in crowded place. You can start the day with drinking coffee looking in ""back yard"" full of potted green plants. <br/>The hosts answer immediately, including first booking, and offer the places where you can go and see or for eat or drink.<br/>The only inconvenience is that there aren't place to leaving luggage if you leave late. The public place to do this is not so close.<br/>Thank you for the hosting,<br/>Boriana & Maria"

It was very close to all of the main attractions: Acropolis, Panathenaic Stadium etc were all within walking distance (lovely part of Athens).

21874640,257151141,2018-04-25,167790982,Eliza,"If you are looking for the perfect place to stay in Athens look no further. Stelina's place is perfect in every way. It is extremely close and you can easily access the most important sights like the Acropolis Museum, the Acropolis, Plaka, Ancient Agora, the Acropoli Metro Station, temple of Zeus etc. The place looks even better than in the pictures, everything is new and spotless. Plus Stelina is a great host and very easy talk to. Had a great time and will surely return."

Metro en tram naar het centrum en naar het strand zijn dichtbij. In de wijk zijn veel winkels, restaurants en koffiebars. Ook meerdere supermarkten om de hoek.<br/><br/>Het appartement voldeed perfect aan de verwachtingen. Ruim, licht en netjes met een klein balkonnetje aan een binnenplaats tussen de locals. <br/><br/>De communicatie met de verhuurder en de ontvangst bij de aankomst was perfect! <br/><br/>Een aanrader voor een paar dagen in het prachtige Athene!"

This place is amazing, clean, and modern, which pictures don't do it justice. It's a light 10 minute walk to the Acropolis and restaurants. If we ever come back we're definitely stay here again!

21874640,273411514,2018-06-06,11265261,Brad,"While apartment was very clean, modern, and centrally located, the experience as a whole was lacking, especially when compared to our stay with other hosts.<br/><br/>This property is run by a management company instead of the direct owner, so the experience was a bit different. While this can sometimes lead to better service and options, I felt that this was not the case here. We never actually met the hosts listed on the property, so our interaction was limited to just messaging through Airbnb. <br/><br/>For all of the properties we stayed at on our two week trip, we were always welcomed with some sort of gift (wine, baked goods, etc) and were even provided with water since the tap water there is not drinkable. This was NOT the case here. All of the recommendations given were tourist traps, so TripAdvisor was our best bet to find local gems. We also had a very early flight on the day of our departure and had a phone without international service so we requested their assistance to schedule a taxi to take us to the airport, and instead of just getting the help, we were told we would be charged and extra 25 euros for them arrange the car.  The back and forth exchange over this took longer (and more energy) then if they would have just booked the car for us without the ridiculous extra charge. <br/><br/>They were very accommodating with an early check-in, but overall the caliber of hosting is lacking compared to their counterparts. The unit was great, just don't expect them to go to any extra lengths to help, at least not without an extra charge."
21874640,274797529,2018-06-10,61212293,Emily,"A lovely apartment in the non-touristy neighbourhood of Koukaki. The apartment is very spacious for 2 people and nice and clean. Great location for all the tourist sites (10m from Acropolis) and about 5 minutes from the nearest metro station. The area has lots of really nice cafes, restaurants and bars, and there are a few food shops just round the corner. The hosts were very helpful and respond very quickly to any queries. Overall, a great place to stay."

21874640,278480249,2018-06-18,77555243,Iris,"I highly recommend this apartment. The bed is extremely soft and comfortable (unlike European beds normally are), the towels smelled clean, the bathroom is modern and shower stays warm. The AC kept the apartment chill during the hot summer days. 10 minutes walk away from everything and it will really make you feel at home! The hosts are extremely responsive by text and we were so happy they accommodated our late time. "

Really close walk (5-10 mins) to the acropolis and some great restaurants, as well as the hop on/hop off bus. Also its such a safe neighbourhood at night for 3 young girls.

Bedroom nice and big, with comfy bed. Bathroom small and shower could have been cleaner. Location was good, however it was a bit of a walk to and from the metro, especially after a long day of walking in the heat. Konstantinos checked us in and was accommodating with out late check in (our flight had also been delayed), however when we arrived at the apartment he was not very friendly and tried rush through everything."

The commute from the airport was simple and took about an hour and a half on the train door-to-door, with only being a 5 minute walk from Syngrou-Fix station. It was also much closer than we expected it to be to all the attractions we had planned, yet still was far away enough for some privacy and rest from the busy centre. The apartment itself was fitted with everything we could have needed and was plenty big enough for two people. There was also a little Aldi-style supermarket less than a minute away for all our necessities. When checking-in we were met outside the building and given a tour of the apartment before we were left to enjoy our stay, and the check-out process couldn’t have been easier. Communcation with the hosts was fantastic too, we never had to wait long for a response. We couldn’t have asked for a better stay in Athens! "

21874640,662510326,2020-09-10,5920139,Luis,Perfect house in the perfect place. It is so close to all the important places to get to know Athens. The hose has everything you may need. Host is also always there in case you need anything. Not much to think if you want some beautiful days in Athens.
21874640,663726491,2020-09-13,142294439,Angelos,Great house and really well placed but don’t come with a car because the parking is scarce. The neighboors are loud and some of them really agressive so don’t engage a conversation with them. But great house to spend a few nights.
21874640,668342567,2020-09-27,105715950,Layla,"Apartment was absolutely spotless and a good size. Great location, supermarkets and restaurants close by, and only a short walk to Plaka and some tourist attractions. The nearest beach was Edam beach and it was literally 10-15 mins on a tram, defiantly worth a visit if you fancy a beach day. Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 2 weeks, and honestly we can not fault it,  we had such an amazing time, and we would defiantly visit again. Thankyou so much"
21874640,670784162,2020-10-04,146031277,Theo,"A brilliant base to explore Athens. Clean and large with high ceilings, and a balcony overlooking a courtyard. 10 min walk from the Acropolis and plaka and plenty of good restaurants and shops nearby. Beaches are only a short bus/metro/taxi ride away. Would consider booking again!"

21874640,724315049,2021-01-15,294231872,Λυδία,"Overall the experience was quite satisfying. The apartment is located near the center of Athens providing the opportunity to do a lot of activities nearby. It is big and renovated, however, there is no natural light. As far as wi-fi connection is concerned sometimes is quite weak throughout the day. Also, there was a problem with the bathroom as I found several insects due to the fact that it wasn’t cleaned properly  before."

Σε πρόβλημα που αντιμετώπισα, η επικοινωνία με τη διαχειρίστρια εταιρεία ήταν εντυπωσιακά άμεση.

21874640,761946989,2021-05-24,12901191,Myroessa,"The apartment is exactly as seen in the pictures, spacious and aesthetically pleasing. It is located in one of the hippest areas in Athens, close to the city center and the old town. Ground floor means it’s dark and inner yard means it’s quiet - enjoying the sounds of the Athenian polikatikia (block of flats) and akaliptos (inner yard). The mattress was too soft but that’s a matter of personal taste. What wasn’t relative was the internet speed (6-12) that forced us to cancel our 2 weeks reservation after checking in as we needed to work which is impossible on this speed. Note that we specifically chose this apartment because it had both a working station and a kitchen table so that we could work. An anissue that most people wouldn’t care about but leaving here just in case - it was easy for us to accommodate ourselves being expats from Athens but wouldn’t be that easy for a visitor with no connections in the city. <br/><br/>Only problem everyone would be finding annoying: the sewerage smell. <br/><br/>And,  also, for a 2 weeks stay I would have appreciated some extra towels and sheets."

Το διπλό κρεβάτι ήταν στην πραγματικότητα δυο μονά με αποτέλεσμα το βράδυ να ανοίγει και να βρισκόμαστε στο κενό ανάμεσα.  Το μεγαλύτερο πρόβλημα που δημιουργήθηκε κατά την διαμονή μας ήταν η ηχομόνωση του δωματίου. Μια πόρτα διαχώριζε δυο δωμάτια με αποτελέσματα να ακούγεται ακόμη κι η ανάσα από τους δίπλανους ενοίκους.

21876398,230129347,2018-01-27,117059421,Chris,The AirBnB is beautifully designed. It looked amazing and felt comfortable. Everything was super sleek and clean. <br/>Pros:<br/>Beautifully set up. Felt comfortable. Customer service was outstanding and hard-working. Gave great tips on what to visit in Athens. Very warm during the winter. Worker was very kind and caring. Amazing view of the Acropolis. Images on the website look real and true in person.<br/><br/>Cons: <br/>Hot water runs out very fast. Can't take long showers. Directions to the AirBnB we're a little difficult especially if it's your first time in Greece. Traffic was loud outside.<br/><br/>Conclusions:<br/>A delightful stay. Despite the number of cons they are all very small. Honestly I'm nit picking a little. Well worth the reservation. I just wish it was a bit cheaper so I could stay longer.

It is very easy to get to from the airport and you are able to navigate most of the city by simply walking. If walking is not for you there is a train station across the street. There are many great restaurants and cafes near the apartment. Loved staying here - it was a great value.

Tons of Restaurants to eat at right outside your door, and walkable to all key points of Athens. <br/><br/>My only problem was the listing made it seem like the roof top terrace was yours alone.. really it is a shared space for the entire building you are in. So keep that in mind when booking. It wasn’t a hinderance to us, but still - something guests should know. <br/><br/>Overall we loved the place. Very clean. Very new and modern. And you can’t beat the location. That’s what we stayed here for. Thanks Kostas and Peter for being awesome hosts! "

You made our trip to and from the airport a breeze with the coordination of drivers! Thank you for the visinada! It was a sweet and good first impression! Peter was a great help explaining how to get around and what to go see and when to go see things. The apartment was beautiful and well maintained! We enjoyed the rooftop view and jacuzzi as well! Thank you again!

21876398,320155922,2018-09-08,20729413,Luke,Beautiful loft right in walking distance of so many great things. The hosts were incredibly helpful kind and considerate. They had all kinds of great recommendations. They even held our luggage for a week while we went sailing. All in all an incredible place to stay. Just a short walk to the gazzi district that is full of great bars and restaurants. As well as an easy walk to the cleanest subway I have ever seen.
21876398,321419727,2018-09-10,28481141,Sonni,"I stayed here and it was amazing, I was in touch with Kostas to surprise my Girlfriend. the communication with Kostas and the execution of it all with staff member Peter were incredible. The Room is very stylish and has everything you need, the hot tub on the roof has a truly wonderful view of the Acropolis. I cannot recommend enough, so close to Gazi and the nightlife. 5 stars all round. Love my stay here, also made my Gf's birthday very memorable and she loved it."

21876398,337657245,2018-10-17,4098141,Anthony,"We had only one night in Athens and stayed here, but we suggest staying here for a longer time. There's a kitchenette if you want to cook, but there are also great inexpensive restaurants in the area. The metro is very convenient, right across the street.<br/><br/>The hosts exceeded expectations in friendliness and provided lots of tips without wasting our time going over details we didn't need. <br/><br/>The location and apartment has a neighborhood feel. If you want to stay like a local, but in a sleek and contemporary place, this is a great option.<br/><br/>The rooftop hot tub was spectacular!<br/><br/>One tip for The Loft... watch your head!"

The apartment is really close to Kerameikos train station only 2x stops away from the main train station in Athen's city centre. Some nice restaurants in walking distance from the apartment.

In Puncto Sauberkeit waren wir auch nicht ganz zufrieden, insbesondere die Dusche war an Rädern und Fugen total verkalkt. <br/>Für Reisende während Corona: Während unserem Aufenthalt stand uns der in der Beschreibung erwähnte Jacuzzi nicht zur Verfügung. Angeblich gäbe es Beschränkungen, die sowas während Corona nicht zulassen würden. Wir wurden erst beim Check-In darüber informiert.<br/>Unabhängig davon ist der Jacuzzi für alle Apartments in diesem Haus zugänglich."

Alexandros a été adorable et nous a donné toutes les informations pour bien profiter de notre dernier jour la bas. Liste des restaurants, les coins à visiter.  Adorable.<br/><br/>A cause de la circulation du virus, nous n’avons pas pu profiter du jacuzzi mais la vue depuis le rooftop est belle. <br/><br/>L’emplacement est légèrement en dehors du centre ville mais à pieds nous avons mis moins de 30 min pour y accéder."

But an higher tier alternative was immediately offered with no additional cost. In the end the original apartment was available again and the host offered a voucher (for another 4 days) for the confusion, although there was no wait time or we would have to adjust our plans. All in all a very nice apartment we would definitely recommend."

21876398,704126962,2020-10-26,313593928,Max,"Die Unterkunft macht optisch erst einmal viel her, aber lässt bei genauerem Hinschauen ein paar Wünsche offen. <br/>Der Jacuzzi gehört der Allgemeinheit- nicht nutzbar aufgrund von COVID- , es gibt keine Fenster zum ankippen und das Belüftungssystem hat für uns nicht den gewünschten Erfolg verzeichnet (sehr trockene Luft).<br/>Die Parkplatzsituation ist eher schwierig: Parkplätze befinden sich auf der Straße und nicht auf einem privaten Grundstück. <br/>Der Bahnübergang befindet sich in 30m Entfernung und alle 10 Minuten kommt ein Zug der hupt. Dementsprechend kann dieses Geräusch sehr belästigend werden. <br/><br/>Allerdings müssen wir Valentino am Check-in sehr loben. Er gab uns private Tipps für Restaurants und diverse Bars und hat damit absolut unseren Geschmack getroffen. <br/>Weiterhin war er überaus freundlich und zuvorkommend. <br/><br/>Kostas haben wir in der Zeit leider nicht angetroffen. Er wurde aber über die Mängel informiert, die wir beim Check-out anbrachten und reagierte schnell und freundlich mit einem Angebot von zwei Tagen kostenloser Übernachtung in einem seiner Unterkünfte bis 2025. <br/>Dieses Angebot wollten wir dann für unseren letzten Tag in Athen nutzen und Kostas wollte sich informieren. Bis heute hat sich Kostas nicht mehr bei uns gemeldet."
21876398,705024905,2020-10-30,211561194,Emilia,"Lovely apartment with an amazing shared roof terrace that has unparalleled views. The location was excellent and the bed was very comfy. We thought the room was going to have further cooking amenities, but all it had was a microwave, however the apartment is situated right next to many nice restaurants and bars, whilst being a 15-20 min walk to centre of Athens. Athens is a fantastic city that is well worth the recommendation and Kostas and his team provided us with extensive local info about sites to see, as well as the best local restaurants, bars and cafes. On our last day we had a late flight at 8pm and the team was very helpful in storing our bags all day so we were fully able to enjoy our last day in Athens. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay."
21876398,706071630,2020-11-02,12290734,Matias,"The place was pretty much as described, very clean and comfortable. The only drawback to me would be the fact that windows can’t be opened to get fresh air.  But the hospitality was  absolutely impressive. Very friendly and attentive."

Η ταράτσα πολύ καλή με ωραία θέα και προσεγμένη. Ωστόσο το τζακούζι λόγο covid δεν ηταν διαθέσιμος αλλά σίγουρα για μελλοντική επίσκεψη θα είναι πολύ καλή ευκαιρία. Τέλος τα μόνα αρνητικά ήταν η ηχομόνωση όπου ακούγονται σχετικά ήχοι, ο θερμοσίφωνας ήταν λίγο αδύναμος διότι το ζεστό νερό τελείωνε σχετικά γρήγορα και το μπουκαλάκι που περιείχε το σαπούνι στο μπάνιο χρειαζόταν αλλαγή. Γενικότερα το συνιστώ και το σημείο το οποίο είναι, είναι προσιτό για τουριστικές εξορμήσεις."

21882929,244659931,2018-03-19,48255387,Katie,Nikos was an amazing host! He was attentive and timely. The apartment was extremely clean and even closer to the Acropolis than pictures can show. The location made Athens very walkable. We did not have any problems during our stay and would recommend Nikos’ apartment to anyone we know going to Greece!
21882929,245934548,2018-03-24,92169495,Guillaume,"Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Nikos malgré notre heure d'arrivée tardive. L'appartement est propre, très bien équipé, litterie confortable. Superbe vue sur l'acropole depuis la terrasse. Bonne localisation. Seul problème, une rue un peu bruyante à cause de la circulation à côté de l'appartement."
21882929,247312502,2018-03-28,144163096,Sabrina,"Nikos y su hijo fueron sumamente amables! Nos esperaron hasta la 1am para darnos la bienvenida a su Airbnb, no hicieron un postre casero griego y fueron los mejores anfitriones que hemos tenido... se los recomendamos al 100% el mejor Airbnb en el que he estado"
21882929,249363070,2018-04-02,110515733,Alex,"Nikos' place is located very close to the best ancient sights that Athens has to offer, with a great view of the Parthenon.

21882929,254224225,2018-04-16,138348054,Dimitra,"We had a short weekend stay in Athens and Nikos' flat was the perfect choice! A modern and very clean appartement with a great view on the terrace! From the flat we could easily walk to the metro, Plaka neighborhood  (~15min)  and even into the city center for some shopping. Also at night we felt very safe in the area! Would definitely  recommend :)"

21882929,256155596,2018-04-22,83947967,Grainne,"Nikos was a fabulous host. He answered every question quickly and gave us great tips about the area. His property was really well kept and in a central suburb of Athens with a traditional taverna, bakery and mini mart just minutes away. The roof top was also a nice little spot to chill in the evening. I would definitely recommend Nikos' place."
21882929,256655759,2018-04-23,71987774,Dirk,The view was stunning from the roof terrace. Very close to the Akropolice. The appartment was very nice and shiny clean. Nikos welcomed us at the door and was very friendly and helpful. A definite recommendation.

21882929,260572254,2018-05-04,49725143,Dan,"Staying at nikos' apartment was an absolute joy. He is a lovely man and has built a beautiful studio apartment in a fantastic location within the city. Communication was very easy and he replied quickly to any questions I had. The rooftop terrace is an amazing space, very romantic and the view is quite literally a masterpiece. I loved my stay in Athens, it's a wonderful city with beautiful people and when I do go back I will for sure hope to stay at this place again. It's a travellers gem"
21882929,262477355,2018-05-09,96325598,Vanessa,"Einen besseren Gastgeber als Nikos hätten wir uns nicht vorstellen können, jeder Zeit erreichbar und super freundlich! Die Wohnung war blitze blank und modern eingerichtet. Die Dachterasse mit dem atemberaubenden Blick auf die Akropolis ist noch viel größer als auf den Fotos zu erkennen... vielen Dank für die zur Verfügung gestellte Unterkunft. Bis bald mal. Liebe Grüße aus Bremen."
21882929,265479803,2018-05-17,108282453,Slone,"I am not normally one to leave lengthy reviews, but our stay at Nikos place was exceptional. <br/><br/>We were first greeted by a wonderful little baked cake, which was delicious and needed after two days of flights. Nikos then went through his very thorough checklist of things he had prepared for us, such as things to do, how to get around Athens two different specially prepared maps with highlights of where to go and how to get there. He was also very patient and spoke English very well. As we were realizing that we had forgotten a wall converter from European wall outlets to U.S. Nikos has already purchased one and had it ready for use in the apartment, which was so amazing as I would not have had any internet access, both my phone and laptop were almost dead. He was very responsive when we asked for recommendations while we were on our stay as well. <br/><br/>As far as the place itself, it was amazing. We chose this location due to its easily walkable access to all of the major things we wanted to see and the view of the Acropolis. Nikos maps of the city and of the metro locations really did help a great deal, as walking directions from (Hidden by Airbnb) maps can be hard to use sometimes. The kitchen was useful as we stayed for a little over a week and cooked breakfast every morning and a few dinners. There are also a quaint little grocery store within a 3 minute walk that has all the essentials. The Acropolis is only about (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minute walk, as is the Acropolis Museum. Hadrian’s Arch and the temple of Olympian Zeus are even closer at about a 8-10 minute walk. Just passed Hadrian’s Arch is the National Gardens and is also great for a bit of sanctuary from the noise and hustle of the city. <br/><br/>The view. The view really is something to savor, we went to about 3 different rooftop bars and a few other places with a roof view for lunch and dinner, but the view from the apartment is as good or better, due to the privacy. We did really enjoy A for Athens, though. The view was great enough that I chose to use that spot to propose while we were here. <br/><br/>Finally, we really did feel welcome and at home by Nikos and his place, from fresh linens to planning ahead for us, this was an exceptional trip and experience. I would recommend this place to close family and friends or complete strangers alike, thanks again Nikos!"
21882929,267914536,2018-05-23,182038300,Lori,"Nikos and his apartment were both wonderful. The view from the terrace is spectacular and the apartment was sparkling clean, we really couldn’t have asked for a better place. <br/>The walk from the metro station could be a little tough if you have a lot of luggage (more than one larger and one smaller bag per person), but it is walkable; however you could also catch a taxi with no problems. With no luggage, the walk to the metro took about 8 minutes or less. <br/>Nikos also responded very quickly when we needed to ask him a question, and was a very gracious host. <br/>I would definitely stay there again if I ever find myself in Athens again."
21882929,269846835,2018-05-28,69927471,Mary Beth,Nikos is truly an amazing host.  He was very thoughtful with our changes in arrival times and very communicative.  The view from his rooftop is truly one of the best in Athens.   His place is very close to public transit from the airport and all the top sites are walkable.   He supplied a map (love that in a host!) and marked sites.   He gave us great tips for our next journey to Crete.  I felt like I had a friend in Greece with Nikos.   And the place is amazing. Spotless.    Modern.   Coffee.  And an amazing dessert!   A super SUPER super host and stay
21882929,273121587,2018-06-05,68902337,Jak,"Very good location, clean and stylish flat. Fantastic view and hosts were very helpful. 11/10"
21882929,274483223,2018-06-09,35331787,Courtney,"Amazing stay at Nikos! He was super friendly, speaks great English and his place was adorable. The terrace view was the best we could’ve imagined. You could see the Parthenon beautifully, worth every penny! "
21882929,275878964,2018-06-12,92281094,Ana Elisa,Nikos was really helpful during the whole stay. He waited for us on arrival outside the building and let us leave our luggage in the building after checkout. He gave us suggestions for places to eat in the neighborhood. The view of the Acropolis from the terrace was really nice. Overall a great experience!
21882929,276553306,2018-06-14,104308600,Molly,"The pictures don’t do this place justice. It is literally across the street from the Temple of Zeus, The Acropolis and Plaka, which is amazing for stores and restaurants. The inside of the condo is gorgeous. The rooftop patio has an incredible, unobstructed view of the Parthenon AND the Temple of Zeus. Nikos was very kind and friendly. He has a binder full of useful information, he gave us a map to the taverna and supermarket which are just up the street (maybe 3 min walk). The taverna had delicious and very cheap food (best tzatziki in the universe they say)! Probably one of the best meals we had during our stay. We LOVED our stay here. As I said, best location and nice condo (very clean and modern). Will definitely come back here and recommend to others."
21882929,277852754,2018-06-17,177181290,Marcella,"We really had a great stay! It was me, my husband, and adult daughter and the place accommodated us perfectly. I would definitely recommend a taxi from the airport vs metro since there is a portion of the walk from the metro is uphill and hard with luggage. Niko’s place was definitely clean and he was so friendly and helpful when we arrived. The rooftop has an amazing view of the acropolis which we enjoyed in the evenings. It’s about a 10-15min walk to the metro/acropolis which is really nice. No complaints! Would definitely recommend staying here. "
21882929,281529541,2018-06-25,172925757,Niles,What a jewel of a place. Every morning and evening we sat on the patio watching the world awaken and fall asleep. walked to every site we wanted and were able to have all modes of transportation available whenever we needed them. Loved it!
21882929,282676134,2018-06-28,95942430,Grace,The apartment’s location is ideal and all the city hot spots are extremely walkable. Nikos was a wonderful host and was very accommodating to our delayed arrival. 
21882929,284801054,2018-07-02,191298725,Laura,"We really loved our stay here. I have stayed in many areas of Athens on previous trips, and this apartment was just a few minutes walk from the main tourist sites. I was slightly concerned about noise on Karea street, but the apartment was so quiet! <br/><br/>The apartment itself was sparkling clean, and I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to cleanliness. The bed was the most comfortable we experienced in our trip to Greece, maybe even the most comfortable in all of my 7 trips to Greece. Niko was wonderful and the little extra touches from him made our stay extra special!"
21882929,285603007,2018-07-04,27963665,Allison,"Nikos went above and beyond to help make us feel welcome! There were snacks and drinks in the fridge, he was patient waiting for us to arrive so we could get checked in, he gave us tips for siteseeing and was just the nicest!<br/><br/>The apartment is very clean and comfortable. The rooftop has an amazing view. The major tourist spots are all within walking distance too! We had such a great stay and would definitely reccommend to others!"

He was very hospitable, met us early to allow us to drop our bags because we arrived before check-in. HIGHLY recommend! Would stay here again."
21882929,288907308,2018-07-11,3750734,Augustus,"Nikos place is amazing! The apartment is impeccably clean, modern and stylish with ample space to sprawl and enjoy a cushy life in the city. The amenities are top notch, and the roof top Terrance has a stunning view of the Acropolis. Nikos was as good a host as you could ask for, he made everything incredibly convenient and easy for us through or 3 day stay. While the place is not located in any immediate ‘cool area’ it is a quick 5 minute walk to good nightlife, markets, cafes, and is only about 10 minutes or less from the very hip Acropolis neighborhoods. I cannot recommend this place enough!!!"
21882929,292095365,2018-07-17,77621541,Ricardo,"Excellent location right next to the Parthenon, beautiful private outdoor rooftop view overlooking the city, and awesome amenities."

Your place is top class in Athens! To everyone - don't hesitate, also very close to everything you want to see here!"
21882929,304274144,2018-08-09,112978189,Katelyn,"Nikos was a great host who provided lots of helpful tips about the area, places to eat, and things to see! He even had brochures about the tours!

El piso completamente equipado, limpio, la cama muy cómoda, decorado con muy buen gusto y ubicado cerca de todo. <br/>La terraza enorme, con tumbonas y con vistas a la Acrópolis y al templo de Zeus nos dejaron con la boca abierta (sobre todo por la noche). <br/>Se trata de un piso que sin duda supera las expectativas y que seguro repetiremos!

21882929,319666224,2018-09-07,52548094,Nilay,"Great place to stay. Nikos was a great host. We had a situation where our ferry from another island was cancelled so we couldn't get to Athens to after midnight. Nikos was ready and met us right in front of the apartment late at night, gave us a tour of the building and pointed out where things were on the map. The apartment is super clean, great location, excellent view of Acropolis from the terrace, comfortable bed. Overall a great stay for us and highly recommended."

21882929,321339205,2018-09-10,174127617,Christine,"Loved our stay in Niko's apartment. Exactly as pictured and what we needed. We arrived by metro with big luggage so would definitely recommend arriving at the actual apartment via taxi/transfer. Location was perfect - close to sights, restaurants, transport etc. View was amazing - we would watch the sunset and the sunrise each day. Would stay again and highly recommend. Thanks Nikos!"

I cannot describe how beautiful it is, you can see the Acropolis, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Mount Lycabettus, it is really beautiful both during the day and during the night! Nikos was very nice, offered to keep our bags before check in time (we had a very early flight) but when we arrived there, the room was ready for us so we were able to check in earlier. Also, he was very fast in replying to our messages, which we really appreciated. The apartment has very good wi-fi connection and the host was very thoughtful and left us some juice and cookies in the fridge, as well as some coffee. To sum up, it was a wonderful stay, I really recommend this place, so close to the centre, plus the rooftop view...  we will definitely stay here, if we get to visit Athens again.

21882929,326399822,2018-09-22,150929050,Nancy,"The apartment is exactly what you see in the photographs, modern, clean, spacious and comfortable.  It is located close to a number of excellent taverns and restaurants full of locals (rather than tourist traps), small supermarkets and about 10 minutes walk to a Metro station that gets you around Athens quickly.  The rooftop of the apartment provides a great view of the Acropolis especially at nigh when it is all lit up, the temple of Zeus and other landmarks. Nikos is a great host, advising on local taverns and restaurants and responding quickly to e-mails and texts.  We had a wonderful holiday in Athens and the apartment was the icing on the cake!"

He was very flexible with checking us in, and gave us a great tour of the place and some tips for making the most of our short stay in Athens.

Cute apartment, great roof top view and location, small details like baked goods and restaurant recommendation....Nikos was outside the apartment to greet us and communication was easy. Highly reccomend!"
21882929,339073796,2018-10-21,76093733,Mark,"Nikos was a great host very friendly, helpful and informative. The apartment is a fantastic space for 1 or two people to base themselves for a Athens trip. All the major sites are easily within walking distance. The flat is really topped off by the private roof terrace, which provides spectacular views across most of Athens. I’d highly recommend."
21882929,341558690,2018-10-27,26815483,Jacques,"What a wonderful apartment and host, strongly recommended. A delightful experience. Nikos helped us in so many ways, and was always there when needed. So many little attentions even a delicious home made cake waited for us on arrival. The apartment is perfectly located to visit Athens with a with a fantastic view of the Acropole from the roof terrasse. Access to the old part of town by foot is an easy 10minutes walk,"

21882929,345830227,2018-11-06,7908620,Veronika,Nikos is the perfect host. His apartment is really nice. All amenities are amazing and very clean. The location in relation to the major sights is great. The only issue we had was the constant traffic noise which made sleeping difficult.
21882929,346566530,2018-11-09,187536337,Michelle,"Nikos was very acomodating... he is a super host by far. He went above and beyond to make sure my stay was just perfect!  I loved the little details, the coffee, the special home made sweets!!! I specially appreciate how comfortable the bed was and and the cleanliness of the place. One time I didn't have hot water and he came to the place to make sure I knew where to turn on the water heater. I will definitely come back and stay in his place! Thanks Nikos!!! You have made my stay on Athens a memorable one!!!"
21882929,347867594,2018-11-12,19566377,Marian&John,Highly recommended! Nikos is an excellent host and communicates quickly and well. The studio has everything you need and the location is perfect.

21882929,351896222,2018-11-24,164400163,Sheldon,"This AirBnB is a great place to stay in Athens, let alone the host, Nikos, is very kind. The AirBnB had everything we needed and wasn't far from a small grocery store that Nikos informed us about. The walk is not too bad to all of the attractions of downtown Athens. Definitely recommend."
21882929,352970805,2018-11-26,24987186,Chris,Nikos is as good as hosts get.  I arrived pretty late after a LONG journey and he was there to make me feel safe and secure in a foreign land.  <br/><br/>The space is really neat and clean and the private view of the Parthenon from the roof is absolutely spectacular.  The moment I settled in and took in the view I knew the long trip was worth it.<br/><br/>The location is within walking distance to virtually everything you come to see I  Athens.  Just be careful out there.  the traffic is nuts!  <br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend Nikos' property to anyone looking to explore Athens.
21882929,353953197,2018-11-30,149986843,Dominic,"This apartment was perfect. It was spotlessly clean, very comfortable and all amenities were provided.  Nikos has prepared guidebooks and local information which was very helpful. The location is ideal for the Acropolis and Plaka. The best part is the roof garden which has the best views and is perfect for a glass of wine in the evening. Would highly recommend!"
21882929,359514946,2018-12-17,102008739,Ramón,"Estancia muy agradable, Nikos es un excelente anfitrión y el lugar es muy cómodo"

21882929,366224257,2019-01-02,88575775,Mathew,"Fantastic location, less than a ten minute walk to the Acropolis and Acropoli Metro stop. Nikos is a great host who makes you feel very welcome. The view from the rooftop alone makes it worth staying here! Bars, coffee shop, restaurants and a grocery are just a block away. Highly recommended."
21882929,368083639,2019-01-06,9209354,Maryline,"Nice clean, well equipped appt with very big roof terrace and located next to a lovely street with a hip bar and supermarket."

Close to restaurants. Has a washing machine so very nice if needed. Only stayed 1 night and  had an early flight, but would stay much longer when visiting!"
21882929,402342026,2019-01-18,226684977,Maria,"Great spot for sightseeing in Athens, lovely apartment and hospitality. One tiny thing is to bring earplugs if you can't sleep to the noise of heavy traffic. Otherwise perfect :)"

21882929,409245271,2019-02-07,5841126,Raymond,Nikos replies very quickly to messages and he was there to give me a tour of the app as well information about where to go in Athens. The app is about 10 minutes walk from the Acropolis easy to access with a taste of Athens out of tourists. I definitely recommend for the decor and how clean it is.
21882929,411042493,2019-02-11,120973659,Monica,Stellar space and location. I found this place to be easy walking distance to everything and just a lovely area.

It is also a very short walk from Acropolis Metro Station. There is also a convenient nearby street with a wonderful (and good value) taverna, bakery and supermarket. It really has everything that you could want!"
21882929,421344540,2019-03-09,158421173,Luciana,"L'appartamento è pulito e ben tenuto, offre tutto il necessario. Splendido terrazzo. Nikos è gentile ed educato."
21882929,423159396,2019-03-13,163509711,Alexandra,"Nikos was an amazing host, and he met us in person to bring us in even though we arrived later than expected. He even spent some time showing us the terrace upstairs (you can see the Acropolis!) and recommending local sights and restaurants. The place was big and clean, and conveniently located near central Athens."
21882929,423790538,2019-03-15,33102959,Preet,"Nik's apartment is in a great location, only 10 minutes walk to all attractions and includes parking. The neighbourhood is wonderful with a yummy tavern, bakery and supermarket across the road. The apartment is modern, clean and provides all the amenities. We enjoyed the private rooftop with views of athens. Would highly recommend staying here when visting athens."

21882929,430249819,2019-03-30,31240610,Alex,"This was probably our best airbnb experience out of all we have ever stayed at. Nikos was willing to wait and meet us in person. He greeted us with biscuits and greek dessert, giving us a detailed tour of his place. The airbnb by the way was a studio with full kitchen, treated as a hotel. Spotless, lots of tour books and guides, mini shampoos and shower gels in the bathroom, and fantastic recommendations for an eatery, bakery, and market 3 minute walk away.  Theres a bus stop 1 minute walk and a metro like 8 minute walk, acropolis 20 minute walk. Not to mention the private rooftop terrace with a view of the city and the acropolis. The only downside is the road outside the window can get noisy since the cars go so fast - my wife needed to sleep with a white noise machine. Overall had an amazing stay for an unbeatable price - highly recommend staying here with Nikos."
21882929,433359315,2019-04-06,237784869,Eveline,"Een prima appartement met alles erop en eraan, ook handdoeken en keukenspullen. We voelden ons al snel thuis. Het appartement is op de 3e verdieping en er is een lift. Ook een groot dakterras met uitzicht op de Acropolis.<br/>Het is keurig onderhouden en schoon.<br/>De aardige eigenaar stond op ons te wachten en dat was fijn, want het gebouw ligt aan een drukke weg. <br/>Bijzonder is dat het appartement gelegen is in een klein kantoorencomplex (eenmansbedrijfjes), wat inhoudt dat je in de weekenden en 's avonds het rijk alleen hebt. <br/>Het ligt zo tegen het centrum aan dat alle leuke en belangrijke dingen heel goed te belopen zijn als je van wandelen houdt (10 minuten naar het Acripolismuseum en 25 minuten naar de ingang van de Acroplis bijvoorbeeld) en verder goede verbindingen met bus, metro en tram.<br/>We waren erg tevreden."
21882929,433814882,2019-04-07,126454020,Jessicah,Great stay!!

21882929,442735199,2019-04-24,15127348,Rosie,"Stunning apartment - clean and spacious, not to mention the view from the private terrace. Nikos was a great host, and check in was seamless.

21882929,453901896,2019-05-17,66084255,Jean,This was a really lovely apartment. It was one room but spacious with a well equipped kitchen and a bathroom . The key point for us was the rooftop terrace . We were able to sit out at night and enjoy the stunning view. If you are not used to city traffic you might need ear plugs !!!
21882929,458633038,2019-05-26,34138435,Jane,"Nikos’s place was a lovely space that is well designed with great views of the Parthenon from the rooftop. Nikos was a great host who gave us tips on where to eat and what to see. It was close to all the main tourist spots, although there are a couple of busy roads to cross to get to them. We would definitely recommend this place and would stay there again."
21882929,460457959,2019-05-29,234509248,Sean,"What a wonderful apartment and the Roof is amazing. To top all of that Nikos was the most wonderful host.

Nikos You were a wonderful host, thank you so much"
21882929,464196655,2019-06-05,168120357,Tracy,Everything was as described.  Little touches of juice coffee cookies.  Well stocked with shampoo etc and the basis to do laundry as well   Tide pod included !  The view is fantastic during the day and night.  Street however is a little noisy at night.

Our flight arrived prior to check-in, so Nikos allowed us to check-in early and drop our bags. Upon check-in, Nikos was very communicative and answered all the questions we had. The apt. has a roof top balcony, only for guests, which has a fantastic night time view of the Acropolis. We very much enjoyed our stay!"

The apartment is cozy, feels safe, and has an amazing private balcony for sitting and enjoying acropolis."

Very clean and close to everything!"

He was most pleasant in every message and in person. We were very comfortable in his apartment and could easily walk to every place we wanted to go. His restaurant suggestion was great too!  We were very pleased to stay at Nikos. Wish we could have enjoyed the lovely  view of The Acropolis from the roof patio, but we were busy seeing the sights and shopping."

21882929,519827299,2019-08-29,95162462,Shohini,"Best experience to start our Athens trip. The space is pretty decent for 3 people. Nikos personally came to meet us, handed over the keys and showed us the apartment around along with the nearest spots from the terrace. He also welcomed us with a log cake in the freezer that was super yum and a bottle of water. The place was otherwise loaded with all necessary amenities including a safety kit in the bathroom. He checked in with us the next day to make sure we are comfortable. Lastly, he was very kind to keep our trolley for a couple of days such that we could visit Santorini and come back to Athens and collect it. We were thrilled to get such great hospitality. Additionally, it's walking distance from Acropolis area. Definitely recommended for booking (in case you find vacancy) well in advance."

When we arrived to Nikos place he was waiting for us. He showed us in and gave a tour of how everything works.  Then he took us to the terrace and showed us the Breathtaking view. The apartment is HUGE ! Contemporary style and very clean. Walking distance to the Acropolis museum and the Plaka area. I was so pleased with this place. Definitely staying here again.

21882929,553116991,2019-10-23,35918240,Lindsay,Had a great stay at nikos. He was a great host and luckily we were able to check in a little early which was great . Niko gave us ideas where  to go and was quick to communicate.  Would stay again  also the bed was the most comfortable of all the airbnbs we stayed the 2 weeks so that says a lot!
21882929,554419501,2019-10-26,263020656,Nancy,"This place is perfect to rent, clean, plenty of room to move around in, walkable to downtown Athens, felt very safe!  Close to food and a bar.  Host (Nikos) was there to meet us and give us tips and even got a taxi to pick us up and take us to the airport at the end of our stay.  I highly recommend this rental!!!"
21882929,555781219,2019-10-28,71374519,Yolanda,"La estancia en el departamento de Niko fue maravilloso!!!  Nos sentimos como<br/>En casa,  el departamento muy acogedor y una terraza con una vista inmejorable"
21882929,557533611,2019-11-01,144169743,Jessica,Nikos was great and so nice. He gave us directions to get there but we still managed to get lost walking there from the metro with all our luggage in tow. It started us off very stressed but the room was very clean and beautiful! The bathroom and shower are very small and you only have a small window of hot water. Nikos provided juice and biscuits in the room for us and even an adapter! He really thought of the little things to really help us enjoy our stay. Oh and the rooftop balcony makes the place! You're also right down the street from some restaurants and walking distance to the Acropolis and Olympic stadium!
21882929,559942356,2019-11-05,16249351,Vincent,"Nikos est quelqu’un de génial ! Il nous accueille à bras ouvert nous donne une petite carte détaillé avec toutes les bonnes adresse, de plus l’appartement est super bien et cette terrasse avec la vu sur l’Acropole ....."
21882929,561848556,2019-11-10,135639709,Vladimir,It really felt as if we were at home.  Apartment is awesome.  Open space with many thoughtful touches.  Terrace with perfect view of Acropolis was all ours.  Market and great bar are very close to apartment.  Perfect stay for couples or up to three people.  Nikos is a great guy.  We will defenitely try to book this place again when in Athens.
21882929,569363959,2019-11-26,69276427,Amy,This place was perfect! Nikos did an amazing job ensuring just about anything you need is there. The whole place is full of light and welcoming! Plus the rooftop view is a plus:) definitely stay here again.
21882929,572853289,2019-12-04,160140566,Razan,Amazing apartment! It had everything you could need. The terrace was spacious and the view was spectacular. Would stay there again.
21882929,583814417,2019-12-29,26048501,Dan,Nikos is a truly warm host who takes great pride in going above and beyond to accommodate guests. He was so very helpful during check-in (even brought us the marvelous terrace to explain the layout of Athens!) You’re just a few short minutes from anything you need and the best sites. 100% would stay at Nikos’ again.
21882929,588207186,2020-01-04,9064144,Mike Kofi,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Nikos' apartment. It is well located for anyone seeking to explore Athens but wishes to not be directly within the hustle and bustle, yet close in proximity to nice cafes, bakeries, and restaurants. The rooftop has an amazing view and all the sights and parks are just a short walk away."
21882929,590631767,2020-01-09,4980974,Artiom,"Nikos was super friendly and helpfull. Taverna and cafe he advised I visited every day - it was super tasty there and for a good price. <br/><br/>The apartment itself is in a very good location - walk distance to main attractions, center. It also has everything one may need, for example, I cooked a lot and had everything I needed for this. <br/><br/>Overall, I can only recommend Niko's place, especially if you are a tourist."
21882929,603326341,2020-02-09,64593243,Kate,"Nikos was great, very accommodating, met us at a time convenient to us, showed us the apartment and the great view from the top. Appreciate the hospitality, can recommend. Clean, comfortable place in a great location. Great vegan spot for brunch just around the corner. Thank you Nikos!"
21882929,610366476,2020-02-24,157352,Sergio,"I really enjoyed staying in this apartment, it was just as nice as on the pictures. Nikos was a very friendly host and I really appreciated little details like olive & vinegar in the kitchen and soap in the bathroom. I would definitely stay here again!"
21882929,611506725,2020-02-27,99719104,Roeland,At about 15 minutes walk from the city centre the appartment is well located and spacious eough. You do hear the traffic as it is aling a quite busy road. Overall very comfortable
21882929,616634226,2020-03-10,331112403,Olivera,"Perfect area, in center of Athens, terrace is gorgeous with best view to Acropoli. All you need is in the aparment. Nicos is great person and host. If we have chance to get back to Athens again we wouldn't change a thing."
21882929,619016690,2020-03-16,66883470,Lindsay,Nikos were great hosts! The place was in an amazing location. It was spotless and full of charm. I highly recommend this place if you’re visiting the beautiful city of Athens!
21882929,638327264,2020-07-15,344967074,Daphne,Awesome host. Very good appartment
21882929,647947458,2020-08-08,23516601,Patrick,"Grand studio situé à l'entrée du quartier Mets, à 10mn de Plaka à pieds, non loin du métro Akropoli. Le studio est vraiment bien placé pour visiter Athènes. Il est propre et bien équipé et dispose d'une climatisation efficace. Le grand lit 1m80 est appréciable. La terrasse est privative à l'appartement et bénéficie d'une superbe vue sur l'Acropole. Son accès se fait depuis les parties communes mais elle en demeure pas moins agréable. Nikos nous a très bien reçu et avait mis une bouteille de jus d'orange au frais pour le lendemain. Belles prestations et rapport qualité/prix."
21882929,659854538,2020-09-03,38220334,Emma,"This was the BEST stay we could have wished for in Athens - Nikos was an amazing host going above and beyond when we were delayed in getting to Athens and meeting us at 3am to give us the keys. The apartment has everything you could want, is in a nice neighbourhood, super close to all the key things to see in Athens and best of all, has a HUGE and amazing view of the Acropolis. We sat out there for breakfast and drinks in the evening everyday and it’s totally private. I couldn’t recommend Nikos and the apartment more highly. Thanks so much for the best welcome to Greece."
21882929,664203395,2020-09-14,473697,Andrew,Great views from a huge terrace and a really nice apartment in central location but noisy from traffic on street. Unfortunately Athens is a really noisy polluted city
21882929,668427907,2020-09-27,213597924,Ralf Patrik,"Nikos has a fantastic place. We have greatly enjoyed our stay at the place. It is very central and has easy access to tourist attractions and public transportation. Also, Nikos made sure to recommend some good places to eat around the apartment which came in handy. There even is a small guide booklet that provides useful information about the attractions and how to get there. Absolutely recommend the place and if I will ever come back to Athens, I'll make sure to check if the place is available again for booking. Also, the terrace is a blessing in disguise. There is nothing more relaxing than sitting outside and enjoying breakfast in the morning or sipping some tea in the evening."
21882929,706088830,2020-11-02,191308462,Thomas Adam,"Nikos war ein toller Gastgeber. Kommunikation erst über (Hidden by Airbnb) , dann vor Ort. Ein mega lieber Kerl.<br/>Die Küch war super ausgestattet. Mit Waschmaschine, Große Betten (für mich zu hart, aber das ist ja bekanntlich Geschmackssache). <br/><br/>Das Beste war natürlich die Dachterasse mit dem Carport, wo man direkten Blick auf die Acropolis hat. Super Abends mit Wein verweilen und im Sonnenschein morgens frühstücken.<br/>Danke Nikos :-)"

21882929,766063127,2021-06-04,89096320,Elena,"The photos are accurate, good position to easily get to all attractions in Athens. The rooftop terrace is a nice bonus to spend your evening on, overlook the Acropolis and Lyccabetus Hill. Would definelty stay here again."

I’m also a super host so my standards are high , you won’t be disappointed !"
21882929,401896587610538286,2021-07-08,27183657,Ariel,"This is an excellent Airbnb! It’a gigantic and can definitely accommodate a larger group of people. The air conditioners are powerful, the bed is comfy, the kitchen is clean and fully equipped, and the bathroom is great. I also enjoyed that there was a dining room table which made it a great place to do my work on my laptop.<br/><br/>Nikos was very friendly and made the check-in process very easy.<br/><br/>The terrace is stunning! With magnificent views of the Acropolis.<br/><br/>Also it’s within short walking distance to all of the major sites.<br/><br/>I recommend staying here for a great stay!"

Ο οικοδεσπότης πολύ κατατοπιστικός και πρόθυμος επίσης. Το συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα!"

21882929,430129465066505201,2021-08-16,32567863,Christopher,"Nikos est un hôte très accessible et aux petits soins. Il a pris de nos nouvelles pendant le séjour pour s’assurer que tout allait bien et était toujours disponible pour la moindre question. <br/><br/>L’appartement est fonctionnel, proche de l’agora (10min a pied). Il aurait pu être un peu mieux insonorisé (on entend le passage des voitures). Il y avait tout le nécessaire pour passer un bon séjour (articles de toilettes, protections périodiques, coton démaquillant, etc), plus que dans tous les Airbnb que j’ai pu faire. Je recommande à 100%."

The location is perfect if you’re looking to see the ancient sites. There were sufficient options for dining, drinking, and having coffee in the morning.

The place was very well decorated and comfortable and had everything we needed. The roof terrace overlooking the acropolis was beautiful, and totally private.

It is situated 10 minutes walk from the Acropolis and so is very convenient for all the sites.  The area felt safe and convenient.  We walked nearly everywhere.  There are good options to eat close by, as well as a small supermarket.  Plaka is walking distance away for more choice.  <br/>The apartment is at the top of an office building (being the only apartment) with exclusive access to the roof, which has a great view of the Acropolis to sit and relax with a cold drink or have breakfast.  <br/>Nikos was very attentive and helpful.

The location, right off a main avenue in Ilisia/Zografou, was perfect: 5-10 minute walk from the metro and many bus lines, in a residential area with lots of local restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores. Anastasia and Panos were incredibly helpful and accommodating when we had some issues with the air conditioners, and because the apartment is in the basement, it stayed pretty comfortable with just a fan.

21897261,221317221,2017-12-26,15620602,Mihai,"Stayed here towards the end of December for 2 days, and based on this I would recommend staying away from the place in winter time. The apartment has no heating and only has running hot water based on a solar boiler - so you would not get hot water always(especially four 4 persons). In the summer it may be better and has a nice terrace to relax - but i have to mention there is no Acropolis view from the location, as the title of the listing falsely advertises.<br/><br/>Our experience with the apartment was pretty dreadful because of the missing heating - only a portable electric heater was found inside the house, and it really failed to do anything to heat the whole place. In the morning of the first night, there were 13 degrees centigrade in the apartment! That is absolutely awful. We contacted Chrysa(who was out of town during our stay) and to her credit she was very responsive and did try to remedy this by having a friend bringing us a larger elecrical heater for the house. Unfortunately this failed to help in any way because of the electical wiring of the house that could not support the load. The fuses kept popping and we ended up with the same situation as first night. On top of that in the morning we had no hot water.<br/><br/>Other than heating, the apartment is currently missing wifi and a fridge, and our first interaction with Chrysa was a bit rocky - as she tried to get some extra $ from us by stating that the price of the listing online is only for 2 persons, and not for 4(we ofcourse correctly indicated the number of persons on the Airbnb page and in the initial message sent to Chrysa before she accepted the booking request). I sincerely hope this was some kind of misunderstanding, but wanted to put it out there for future travelers!"

21897674,227954152,2018-01-17,135922543,재웅,위치도 지하철에서 가깝고 집이 매우 깨끗합니다. 발코니에서 보는 야경과 주경도 매우 괜찮아요. 집앞에 미니슈퍼도 있고 서쪽으로 750미터 쯤 가면 엄청 큰 슈퍼마켓도 있네요. 호스트도 굉장히 친절하고 유쾌했습니다.

21897674,253799828,2018-04-15,175994317,Cuciuch,"We spent a weekend in Amelie's apartment. We loved the little terrace and we spent both evening there, drinking wine and glancing at Athens. The apartment has a very good location ( 6th floor ), overlooking the city, close to the metro station and 20 minutes walk to city center if metro is not your thing. Would recommend and return :)"
21897674,255014672,2018-04-19,36241023,Jorge,Good option. Very well located. I would repeat.

Hosts are outstanding, always got prompt responses, took us from airport, took us to airport (even on Sunday 6am!). Surrounding streets looks a bit shady when you arrive, but it's definitely safe and we did not face any problems (walked at night etc). Apartment has all basic amenities and it's very clean, metro station is pretty close too (and taxis)."

21897674,271361763,2018-06-01,18290418,Sandra,"Amelie’s two bedroom apartment was a perfect fit for me and my two teens. Even though it’s a small apartment, we were able to have separate space, if needed. Be sure to sit out on the balcony and enjoy the sunset. <br/>We were within a 15-20 minutes walk to the main attractions. When we first arrived, Paris offered enough information to get us exploring Athens. There’s a market across the street which is always a bonus. The main Athens train station, TrainOSE, is nearby."

We would recommend this apartment mainly for adults, because the kitchen is a bit tight which may not suit for children.<br/><br/>Overall, everything was made really easy for us !  "

Quite comfortabel flat and I loved the terrace at the top of the builiding and the view from there across the city! Metro to the center has been very close. Just a minute to walk and only 2 stations...

21897674,334014733,2018-10-08,79121845,Magdalena,"The apartment is quite big, renovated and well equipped. It is located just next to the subway station. To the main tourist attractions you can also get by foot in about 30min. For us the only drawback was that the neighbourhood seems not to be very safe in the evenings. Generally we reccomend the apartment if you want to visit the city :)"
21897674,334843901,2018-10-10,213641027,Guido,The apartment is nice and near to the principal attractions.

Il est très bien situé à 1 minute de la station de métro Victoria et donc tout près des centres d' intérêt. Nous sommes arrivés plus tard que prévu à cause d un problème de bagage à l aéroport mais Amélie a gentiment envoyé son fils nous attendre et c était très appréciable . Merci encore. Appartement calme et agréable.

21897674,356431260,2018-12-08,80740986,Giri,The kitchen is not convenient for cooking. But there are places around and it is very near to the metro station.

21897674,446333704,2019-05-01,66600748,David,quick responses and 100% accuracy
21897674,451093406,2019-05-11,259987999,Edoardo,"Casa in ottimo stato, quartiere leggermente degradato ma in buona posizione e attaccato alla metro e ad una piazzetta con ottimi bar. A due passi dal museo nazionale archeologico di Atene e a 20 minuti di camminata dall'Acropoli. Ottimo servizio da parte dell'host, molto gentile e disponibile. Non fatevi spaventare da qualche commento sul quartiere, non abbiamo mai percepito alcun pericolo, nemmeno quando si sono messi a litigare due sotto casa venendo praticamente alle mani, si sono fermati per aprirci la porta, poi hanno continuato!"
21897674,453882957,2019-05-17,4497139,Eleftherios,"A value for money appartment at a secure location near Victoria Square. This used to be an unsafe area and because of that there is police presence 24/7. The appartment is close to the square, the area is well lit, so it is safe. There are mini markets, restaurants, shops all around. The METRO station is less than 2 minutes away. The appartment is on the 6th floor of a quiet building. It is not a large place but it is enough for 3 people. There is no TV as mentioned on the listing and even though I stayed for 4 nights i did not miss it. There is a rapid fast WiFi connection and plenty of internet content. The aircon works properly. For the money and the location you can not find a better deal, especially if you are in Athens to go sight seeing and not stay inside the four walls of an appartment. All my messages to the host were answered in less than one minute, Amelie and her son are very nice people."
21897674,455759069,2019-05-20,124852704,Xuechan,Neat appartement near the metro station. Everything is fine. I recommend.
21897674,457001883,2019-05-23,259614088,Erika,"Amelie ‘s place is very close to the metro, so you can move through the city with ease. The apartment is comfortable and clean with two bedrooms and a nice living room and balcony. It also has elevator which is great because it’s on the uppermost floor. Mini market and bakery nearby, also a few restaurants near the metro, so you won’t lack anything."
21897674,457873791,2019-05-25,13065789,Lorenzo,"Nice apartment in convenient position, close to Subway. Amelie's son was really kind in the check-in process, and communication was quick!"
21897674,459354409,2019-05-27,20352382,Marianna,"Beautiful, new house, even if I am in the center of Athens it was in 6th floor and it felt I was not. Thank you for the hospitality I would choose it again."
21897674,464651468,2019-06-06,261709757,Thanasis,The house was great in a central location. No issues whatsoever! Recommended.<br/><br/>Βολίκη τοποθεσία για κάποιον που χρειάζεται αμεση πρόσβαση στο κέντρο.
21897674,465604653,2019-06-08,42652557,Nathalie,"Un coup de coeur sans faute pour cet appartement très cosy, calme (6è et dernier étage), bien situé à la limite de l'hypercentre (sans le bruit), très joliment décoré, fort bien équipé, bon rapport qualité-prix.<br/>Les 3 pièces sont certes petites (mais suffisantes) et parfaitement aménagées. On s'y sent fort bien. Le balcon constitue un plus.<br/>La proximité de la station de métro Victoria est un plus (10 min à pied d'Omonia).<br/>Bien situé aussi pour rejoindre port, aéroport, gares ferroviaire ou routières (A et B).<br/>Le quartier est populaire ; je n'ai ressenti aucun problème de sécurité en rentrant seule vers 21h30 le soir.<br/>Enfin, la communication avec Amelie a été parfaite (réponses immédiates à mes questions avant mon séjour) et en particulier pour ce qui concerne mon heure d'arrivée. J'ai été fort bien accueillie par son fils Michael, très sympa et parfaitement francophone.<br/>Je conseille vivement cet appartement et n'hésiterai pas à revenir.<br/>Si vous venez avec des enfants ou si vous portez des longues écharpes, faites juste attention à l'ascenseur qui ne dispose pas de double porte intérieure (je bosse dans la prévention...)."
21897674,469198348,2019-06-14,103126345,Mylène,"Great experience! Amelie was always available when i had questions before the trip. Despite our 3hour delay (we arrived at 3am) , she was very welcoming ! the appartement is very good for two or more People. The great surprise: the balcony very well exposed where we had dinner and rested all evening after the visits. The Subway is 3min away by walk ! And you can find good coffee shops in the neighborhood, supermakets, clothes shops... It is only 20min away by walk from psiri (very Nice neighborhood) although i do not recommend to cross town by night or alone when you are girls. We walked through some areas that were not always ""safe"". The metro is very well made, and the appartement is one station away from the big stations where you can change lines. Cherry on the cake: the air conditionner in the bdroom ! It was very hot at night, so the AC was a blessing.<br/>If youre looking for a good place, not expensive for the week, i recommend Amelie's place :)"

Το μόνο μείον ήταν το ασανσέρ που δεν ερχόταν μέχρι τον 6ο όροφο κάποιες φορές επειδή κάποιες πόρτες σε άλλους ορόφους δεν έκλειναν καλά. Το συστήνω παρ' όλα αυτά ανεπιφύλακτα!

L'entrée dans les lieux était parfaite. Malheureusement, l'appartement n'était pas aussi bien équipé que nous le pensions (quasiment rien dans la cuisine pour cuisiner, pas de rideau de douche - la salle de bain était sans cesse trempée, et nous avons été surprises de l'inconfort des lits). Malgré tout, pour ce prix, l'appartement est relativement bien placé et Amélie s'est montrée très cordiale et disponible."

21909590,229533070,2018-01-24,86918165,Antonis,"I need to go often to Athens and I have found the perfect place. Alexandra’s penthouse is wonderfoul, with much space, very cosy, spacious and with a magnificent view of the city and Lycabettus mountain! The view from the veranda at the evening and at the night, with the lighted mountain, is ingredible! The flat is foul of balconies, and from the rooftop you can see the Acropolis as well. The flat was also very clean, remarkable quit (it is in the center of the city), it has air conditioners, a desk room to work, and the bed and the sofa bed were very confortable. The apartment is in the center of Athens, in walking distance from the old town (about 30 min). Alexandra was incredible friendy and helpful, and she welcomed as very warmly. The communication with her was easy. It was an extremely pleasant stay, I definitely come back when I need to stay again in Athens! Thank you Alexandra!"
21909590,237230587,2018-02-22,15791755,Celena,"Beautiful and clean penthouse apartment with multiple balconies and city views! We loved sitting under Lycabetus hill when it was lit up in the evening. Alexandra was very responsive and a fantastic host. The sites are about a 20 minute walk, but it’s all downhill. Great value for the space and amenities."
21909590,242803943,2018-03-13,128776931,Barb,"Alexandra was a great host! She emailed back right away and her English is great, which made life super easy. The airline lost our luggage and she was super accommodating. <br/><br/>However, you have to wait half an hour for hot water to shower in the morning, the tap in the tub doesn't work and the shower isn't mounted (you have to hold it). Otherwise yes the view was great!"
21909590,245432695,2018-03-22,2504710,Ralf,Alexandra's place was just lovely. Very clean and spacious and with several balconies facing in different directions with many amazing views. The neighborhood is great with a lot of local flavour. Highly recommended.
21909590,247652131,2018-03-29,25709672,Fionn,Beautiful home in a great location. Alexandra was more than helpful!
21909590,267564727,2018-05-22,155156470,Gabriella,"Gorgeous and spacious penthouse apartment located near Mount Lycabettus! The balconies around the apartment and the rooftop give you a lovely view of Athens. It's a quick metro ride away from the more touristy areas like around the Acropolis and Monastiraki so you get the benefit of being near the action and coming back to a quieter location to rest and relax. Alexandra is deservedly an Airbnb Superhost. Her responses were fast and detailed, the guidebook she provides has great tips, she was kind and  accommodating when our ferry coming in was delayed, and she was kind enough to arrange for transport to the airport for us. I would definitely recommend this host and her apartment to anyone staying in Athens!"
21909590,270425508,2018-05-29,173324139,Deepak,Very clean place we arrived earlier tan expected and alexandra was kind enough to do quick cleaning after checkout and accomodate us . House view to acropolis is amazing and stunning in evening . Overall a very nice place.<br/>

She met us cheerfully when we finally got in and gave us the best dinner recommendations. Her place was spacious and clean, and the views from her terraces were some of the highlights of our time in Athens!! Highly recommend. "
21909590,278959124,2018-06-19,20513584,Rebecca,"Our time at Alexandra’s place was perfect. The place is walking close to most of the ancient places. The apartment was clean and cozy. Pretty big and spacious with a great view to the city. <br/><br/>Alexandra is an excellent host. She was waiting for us at the same time we arrived with cold water and beers. In the kitchen had coffee, tea, condiments to cook and fruit. She took time to explain everything to us but also has a very useful folder where not only she tells you how to have a good time at her home but also around Athens the city. <br/><br/>We loved it and highly recommend it."

She was very prompt in her replies and all the information regarding directions & facilities are available on her  listing page . With multiple balconies , the views of the Athens  city from her home were great . Loved the way she has decorated her home too , giving it a very quirky yet  welcoming atmosphere . "
21909590,282405757,2018-06-27,5395759,Alex,"Alexandra’s place is charming and even better than pictured. It has beautiful views, gardens, art and lots of character. It’s in a perfect location. The neighborhood itself has a nice selection of bars and shops and it’s quiet at night... plus it’s right nearby more bustling tourist areas and a 30 minute walk from the acropolis. Alexandra was very responsive and accommodating and took time to show me around and provide great recommendations. Thank you Alexandra!"
21909590,287301874,2018-07-08,11930329,Mervyn,Alexandra was the most pleasant host and her penthouse was an amazing place to stay. It is very central to all the main sights in Athens and contained everything needed to make our  visit perfect. We would definitely stay here without question again if we returned to Athens and recommend Alexandra as a superb host to all Airbnb guests. 
21909590,288545939,2018-07-10,188289173,Jakub,"Everything was great. Quick communication,. Alexandra’s place is nice, stylish, clean, very big and have nice view. I definitely recommend."

21909590,311459369,2018-08-21,199100073,Hien,"Alexandra is a lovely host , her apt is clean and cosy, all rooms have AC and it has a nice view of Acropolis. She put together a detailed information package for her guests to explore Athens . She accomdated my request to leave my luggage in her apt until 6pm . We had a nice stay at her apt and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a place to stay when visiting Athens. "
21909590,354263951,2018-12-01,226867387,Sigrun,Alexandras Wohnung ist sehr sauber und gemütlich. Besonders der Blick auf den Lykavettus ist fantastisch. Alexandra ist sehr freundlich und empathisch.  Jederzeit gab sie uns gute Tipps und Anregungen. Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder.
21909590,368090069,2019-01-06,10734921,Fiona,"Alexandra’s home is warm, cozy, (not small, it is homely and comfortable), with amazing views from every room in the home and also the rooftop. <br/>It’s in a great location with access to all the tourist sites in a short time, as well as a good bakery and a supermarket yards from the front door. <br/>Alexandra is a great host. She’s thoughtful and giving, a beautiful soul. Thank you Alexandra, we’ll be back."
21909590,417727453,2019-02-28,185342430,Evdokia,"Alexandra ia a great host, very quik in response, and she showed us everything we had to know about our stay. The flat is wonderful, specius, big, very clean, with much character. The views are amazing! There are balconys everywhere, a big terrace with stunnig view of the Lycabettus hill, and at the other side of the apartment to almost all Athens! There is a view even from the bathroom! I highly recommend this place. Thank you Alexandra!"
21909590,433872996,2019-04-07,13312222,Grzegorz,"Alexandra’s place is an authentic Greek flat with true soul and associated little quirks. <br/>The space consists of a double bedroom, a living room with a 2-person sofa, a spacious kitchen and a dining room with additional seating/lounging space, and a bathroom with a bathtub/shower.<br/>The flat’s main selling point are the plentiful balconies/terraces (of which there are four - two spacious ones with lots of seating and two smaller ones). Alexandra also provides the key to the rooftop terrace, offering a 360 panoramic view.<br/>The flat is not your typical, soulless apartment for tourists - there are personal touches like decorations, art and quirks as well as some of Alexandra’s private belongings - this makes your stay feel more home like and authentic. <br/><br/>If you want to spend your time in Athens like  local and are looking for good value, you definitely won’t be disappointed."
21909590,439522352,2019-04-19,255374811,欣,"The landlord is warm and generous, has a nice balcony view, can overlook half of Athens, the house is located in the old city center, the road is narrow, suitable for walking and strolling. The room function partition is reasonable. It's just that the room bed is a bit small, and it would be a little problem if it was a tall man."
21909590,458465378,2019-05-26,14218839,Piero,"The apartment was spacious, truly homely and comfortable and had all the facilities we needed. The views from two separate balconies are special. Local streets are buzzing with life throughout the day and night with bakeries and bars nearby. Walking was easy and the metro station is not far. Alexandra met us on check-in and was highly communicative throughout and clearly really cared that we enjoyed our stay. I’d go back tomorrow."
21909590,469805451,2019-06-15,29001731,Matthias,Outstanding responsive host that let us checked later which made a huge difference for us and our late flight. Place has multiple balconies that make the place bright and extremely spacious and different. Real kitchen with all the tools needed to cook properly.  Air conditioning working very well and not too loud that is welcome in a very hot night.
21909590,556736883,2019-10-30,110223298,Sarah,Alexandra was a very helpful host and responded to all our questions quickly. Her place was clean and walking distance to the square. There was lots of different views of Athens which was nice.
21909590,557980628,2019-11-02,65958271,Tj,Alexandra's flat was wonderful on all counts. Highly recommend staying here if you're looking for convenient location in Athens.
21909590,570779177,2019-11-30,258098557,Amy,"Lovely home with 4 accessible balconies, all the amenities you could hope for, and snacks+wine from Alexandra! The location is nice and quiet, away from the hustle and bustle of the historic center. It also is easily walkable from her place to further downtown, and the area is full of boutiques/artisanal shops, secondhand stores, cafes, etc. Alexandra is warm and accommodating and is thorough to inform you about your stay as well as tips for exploring Athens! <br/><br/>Thanks Alexandra, I hope to come again soon!"

21917398,261887992,2018-05-07,37334510,Maximilian,"Lydia really helped us when we were in a pickle after our other host cancelled our reservation last minute.<br/><br/>She received us (2 adults, a baby and 2 dogs) within a few hours of us first writing her and made us feel welcome while giving us space to unwind after a stressful 24 hours.<br/><br/>While her place isn't the tidiest or most spacious we have stayed at, it's most certainly the coziest and the one we felt most at home in.<br/><br/>Unlike so many other places on Airbnb you can feel that someone actually lives in the apartment and it feels homey as soon as you step through the door.<br/><br/>We're already planning our next stay there and can't recommend Lydia and her home highly enough."
21917398,596615873,2020-01-23,209412956,Cate,"Lydia’s place was cute and cozy and just what I wanted for my long stay. She made me feel very welcome and her place felt like a home away from home. Great space and great location, I would recommend this apartment to anyone."

21917398,633542597,2020-06-30,5132157,Cydne,"Highly recommended - perfect location, amazing host, lovely apartment, overall I absolutely loved my stay! I stayed here for 2 months and couldn’t have asked for more. Lydia was incredible in terms of communication, provided everything I needed and was always there when I had any questions.<br/>The apartment is a good size, very comfortable, and homely. It has all amenities you need (washing machine, loads of kitchen utensils, tv, etc), comfortable bed and sofa, air con, etc.<br/>As one of the other reviews mentioned you can tell it’s actually someone’s home with loads of personal touches which is really nice to see and nicer than other quite steril Airbnbs these days. While it’s not super fancy it’s somewhere you can really feel at home in.<br/>It’s situated in Pagrati with loads of bars, supermarkets, restaurants etc on your doorstep, but as it’s on the third floor it is relatively quiet. Walking distance to the city centre.<br/>Overall I cant recommend this place enough - whether for a short city break or a longer stay, Lydia’s apartment is the perfect stay in Athens!"

21917398,656877513,2020-08-27,357068330,Sina,"The house is near to Supermarket, and 20 min walk to Temple of Zeus, so it is somehow near to historic places. You can find many useful tools in the house but the problem is that the house is not clean at all. It smells like old houses and you can find dirt everywhere. Unfortunately, the wifi is very slow. I must add that, Lydia is very kind and responsive and she answered many of my questions in short time."

He was very quick to solve any problems that arose. Check-in/out with lockbox was comfortable and easy, plus a late check-out was possible, too<br/><br/>4 Stars for the flat itself:<br/>Good: Location (15min bus ride to Omonia) and cleanliness<br/><br/>Neutral: Natural lighting in the bedroom only. I´m under the Impression that the whole design wasn´t very well thought trough: Why is there no power outlet in the bathroom; why is the showerhead fixed permanently fixed at a height of 1,80m, thus forcing taller People to halfway step out of the shower in order to not bang their head on the shower head; why is there so much unnecessairy stuff in the flat that occupies valuable spacein this rather small flat (e.g. one bookshelf with literally Nothing but Pictures in it)?<br/><br/>Bad:  It look gorgeous on pictures, however the look and feel of the whole flat is rather cheap . All of the following examples are not a problem/valid reason to deduct a star if you view them as isolated incidents - however when viewed as a whole, you get the Feeling that the host tried to cut a lot of Corners and save Money wherever possible.:  the Corners of the door are worn off/splintered, the sofa bed is uncomfortable, there are cables hanging from the wall, the toilet keeps running (although easily fixable if you just push the floater upwards) and the water pipe was leaking, resulting a little puddle in the kitchen (althoug the host very quickly organized a plumber to repair it)."

21932549,531283864,2019-09-17,10742670,Tukta,"This is a beautiful/quiet apartment. Everything works and we found it very comfortable. It also seemed to be very good value. <br/><br/>The location seemed a little far away from the center for us tourists. We paid about $30 roundtrip for taxis to get to and back. Nothing noteworthy in  the neighborhood. It seems run down --- plenty of graffiti and homeless. If you are a man who like drinking coffee, smoking and eating Gyros, you have died and gone to heaven. <br/><br/>Remember that check-in is around 2pm.  And you can't put the bags anywhere until 12pm. You may wish to book a day early if you are arriving early in the morning. <br/><br/>The lady who met us at check-in was very helpful. Check-out was simple. <br/><br/>There was a private internet router with a strong connection. We were very happy to have it. (First one for the trip!)"

21932549,589549326,2020-01-06,152206626,Georgia,"The communication with Nektarios was good, he provided us a late check in and the apartment looked clean. We booked the apartment because the listing said: 2 bedrooms. Unfortunately there is only 1 bedroom and a sofabed in the livingroom/kitchen. The matress of the big bed (although mentioned as new) was not very comfortable to sleep on. Also the sofabed was not convienient. Although the apartment has central heating we could only heat with airconditionings which made quiet a noise so despite the communication was good and the apartment was situated perfectly and was 5 star clean, we felt a bit misleaded by the fact the advertisement says 2 bedrooms so we left after one night and Nektarios was so kind to send us a reimbursement. With some extra details this apartment could be perfect for solo travellers or couples."

You could use the Public transport very quickly and in a few minutes you were in the center of Athens and the Acropolis.For a distance from the house To the center of Athens it was only one station with train.the neighborhood was quiet and everything was next to you from a supermarket to a pharmacy.If you wanted to move with the public transport was very easy because the bus & the Train station It Was exactly near to you. Marina & Spiro Thank you for everything

They were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed right away! The house is really cozy with a nice touches on decoration that makes you feel like home. The bed is also really comfortable. Located in a quiet and safe neighborhood yet 2 metro stops from the center and the nightlife area. We will definitely return to their apartment when we are back in athens! Thank you so much guys for making sure our stay was smooth and pleasant, hope to see you soon!"

Spyros assured us that we were a 5 minute walk from the best Souvlaki in Athens - he was right! ( the place is called Best Taste, mainly take away but with cafe type diner if you can’t wait to tuck in).<br/>Spyros is a delightful & helpful host. The apartment is walking distance (20 - 30 mins) from all major sights but as it is only 1 metro stop from the same sights we suggest you take the train and save your shoe leather for sightseeing - you will get plenty of exercise don’t you worry.<br/>If you are driving parking is possible but tight in the area - persevere you will find somewhere ( we found a space 100 yds away).<br/>Highly recommended for a couple - bit of a squeeze if there are 3/4 of you but even then it would be fine for a few days as there is a sofa bed in the living room."

21932846,272755509,2018-06-04,24410663,Arantxa,Spyros has a great place to stay in a very nice neighborhood 2 stations away from de center of Athens. Very friendly and welcoming his place is worth staying when spending a few days in Athens. Left a nice bottle of wine for us too!
21932846,276239906,2018-06-13,45226147,Melissa,Cute apartment - roomy and comfortable - near the tourist attractions but far enough away you are out of the craziness.  Spyros and Marina give great recommendations for local services and check in regularly to be sure we are ok and have what we need.  The local area and people were extremely hospitable and we enjoyed the local restaurants.  I would recommend this apartment and will contact Spyro and Marina again if we return to Athens!
21932846,276899895,2018-06-15,135884044,Kelly,"The apartment was beautifully decorated, very clean, and location to restaurants and metro was perfect!<br/>Spyros gave accurate directions to the apartment and Marina’s lunch recommendation was delicious!<br/>Communication is quick and thorough. Spyros checked in daily to be sure we had everything we needed. You won’t regret booking your stay in Athens with Spyros and Marina!"
21932846,277798869,2018-06-17,111186725,Marcus,"Spyros and Marina's place is a great finding! Very well located where you can easily and quickly get by Athens' most popular attractions, but far enough from that touristy catch: we could find restaurants and grocery stores with really cheap prices and could feel like locals around. As soon as we got there, we were received with Chocolate and Marina's jam, what a treat! The apartment is great and new but I would reccomend switching the living room's AC to the bedroom due to the noise, but this fact does not make a problem on the stay. We had a great time! Spyros was always quick to respond whatever needs we had. Would def. stay there again. "

21932846,282343641,2018-06-27,60767014,Samantha,Comfortable and clean space! We easily walked to acropolis within 30 minutes. Only downfall was difficulty getting hot water for shower for longer than 5 minutes.

Located very close to a metro stop and within walking distance of the acropolis (or easily take metro) the position is perfect. The area is filled with residences and nearby shops and restaurants are easily within a short walking distance. I never felt unsafe in the slightest even when coming home late at night. The place itself is reasonable sized, air conditioned and well decorated. I stayed by myself but by no means would feel crowded. Check in is very easy and Spyros is very helpful and attentive. He is quick to answer any questions and more than happy to offer advice and ensure that you’re enjoying your stay in Athens. I would easily recommend the property to friends and family, and would definitely stay again without hesitation. Thanks for having me! :)"

21932846,304290977,2018-08-09,6864663,Katie,"Spyros and Marina have a wonderful place to stay at!! The location was about a 15-20 minute walk to the Acropolis,  the Plaka and Monastiraki. There is a train station near the apartment but it was so beautiful while we were in Athens that we chose to walk everywhere! The first night we got in Spyros recommended a local restaurant right around the corner from the apartment called Mayor and it was AMAZING, we actually went there twice in our 3 day stay. Spyros was always available to answer any of our questions and even checked in on us halfway through our stay to make sure everything was going well and if we needed anything. I highly recommend staying here, it was wonderful and we could not have asked for better hosts! "

Er hat uns Tickets für eine Tour ausdruckt und ein sehr gutes Restaurant empfohlen.<br/>Das Apartment war sehr sauber, schön eingerichtet und war nicht weit von der Metro entfernt."
21932846,311397118,2018-08-21,118140812,Ashlee,Easy location right near the metro station. Or if you feel like walking (which is what we did) you can walk to all the sites which will take around 20-30mins depending on your pace. Just take some water with you if you walk and some grippy shoes as the pavements in the older parts of town is quite slippery.

The location could not be beat -- in a quiet part of the city, yet an incredibly easy and short metro ride to the hustle and bustle of it all. A very easy ride from the airport and also short ride to the port. The space was exactly as described and was very cozy and private. <br/>Spyros made getting there and getting around easy and provided so many helpful tips to make our stay convenient. It was great to know that the hosts were close by if we needed anything and they even messaged us to checked in during our trip. Very friendly and welcoming hosts! Would definitely recommend and would love to stay again! Thanks for everything, Spyros & Marina!!"

Not only does it look even better than the pictures online, the hospitality of the hosts was beyond amazing! Very quick responses and helpful tips - and they even called me a cab one night when I was unable to get one myself (sometimes the language barrier can make calling a cab challenging). When I messaged Spyros in the middle of the night, he responded immediately and had a cab there within 7 minutes.  Also, the restaurant they suggested named “Best” is literally the BEST food I’ve ever had.  I would recommend this home over any 5 star hotel any day :-)"

Although as it is situated on the 2nd floor, the lack of an elevator in the building should be mentioned in description , as one has to climb 2 staircases of each 18 steps to reach the apartment. Metro is 5 minutes walk from the house, one stop  to Theissio (Acropolis), Monastiraki and city center. Several supermarkets on walking distance, street market on Wednesday in a paralel street, nice restaurants in the direct neighbourhood and the best souvlaki down the stairs of the metro when returning from the city."

21932846,444068240,2019-04-27,114652629,Steve,"This is a spacious apartment with friendly, helpful hosts. I didn't meet Marina, but Spyros is very outgoing, enthusiastic and communicative. The apartment itself is a bit off the tourist track (it's a 15-20 minute walk to Thissio, which is one Metro stop away), but it's a solid, safe neighborhood and you can get anywhere you need to go from here. There are a couple of good restaurants nearby (recommended in the info manual in the apartment), but I didn't find a ton of variety so if you're looking beyond souvlaki you'll probably need to go farther afield — which is still doable even by walking. The internet in the apartment was the biggest drawback for me — there's no password on the wi-fi so anyone within reach of the signal can use it (not even getting into any security worries), and the router is old; I was resetting it multiple times per day as it dropped out. Still, recommended."

Only a few minutes from the metro, which made it easy to access the airport and port. The apartment was large with a living room, kitchen, outdoor patio, and bedroom.

This was our TOP1 AirBnb experience!<br/><br/>Spyros & Marina were awesome and their AirBnb home is excellent in all ways - excellent location, spacious and beautiful, sparkling clean, wonderful small touches everywhere like flowers, candles and a full fruit basket. Communication was very good, super prompt, friendly and clear.<br/><br/>Lots of space throughout the apartment, everything felt of good quality! Wonderful bedroom with a big comfortable bed, a balcony and an air conditioner. Great big shower in a nice sparkling clean bathroom that also had a washing machine. <br/><br/>Kitchen had everything we needed and much, much more. Comfortable and beautifully designed and decorated living room with a flat screen TV, great couch, air conditioner, luxurious marbel floor and a nice balcony. Spent a lot of time in the balcony relaxing in the evening with some nice Greek wine. I must note that the carpet in the living room is really nice and comfortable.<br/><br/>Wifi worked great! Suitable for business travel as in addition to the excellent wifi, there's a good desk in the living room to comfortably work at for longer time if needed.<br/><br/>Easy and flexible check-in! Spyros & Marina were super communicative, extremely helpful and flexible with the check in making sure the apartment was sparkling clean and ready for us already early in the morning - our flight arrived very early and way before check in time!

Spyros and Marina are the most hospitable hosts I've ever come across! They had arranged for a lovely taxi driver, Kosta, who happenes to be their friend, to pick me up from the airport. Although my flight was delayed, Kosta waited patiently and I only had to pay the regular taxi fare for the distance covered. The apartment is located in a peaceful neighborhood of Kato Petralona and only a stroll away from the shops and train station. The apartment itself is very spacious, clean, beautifully decorated, and both the couch in the living room and the matress on the bed are very comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need if you wish to have a coffee and prepare a meal. Also, the bathroom is nicely presented and the washing machine is very handy. Both the neighborhood and the suburb of Kato Petralona is very safe and central.

The apartment is artistically decorated, spotlessly clean, with lots of light and full of lovely little touches that makes it a home away from home.  Nicholas and Marina were incredibly hosts--helpful, communicative going above and beyond what we expected.  We were a group of 6 and could not have asked for a better place to relax after hectic sightseeing during the day.  Highly recommended."

There were many thoughtful and many extra touches in the apartment, plenty of all the essentials and extra treats as well. We received great communication in the lead up and a very warm welcome to Athens. The apartment is on a busy road so is a bit noisy - but it is consistent traffic noise, not honking, so while we were surprised at first it didn't end up bothering our family. The terrace has an amazing view. The location is great - such a special experience to be in strolling distance to the ancient Greek monuments, we were even able make a quick second visit to the Acropolis on our last morning before flying out - it is a very central location."

He arranged transportation for us and upon our arrival by plane, our driver (Takis, who was very professional and helpful) was waiting. The apartment was a great location,  easy walk to Acropolis and Plakas, and had wonderful rooftop views. The furniture was modern, pictures serve it well.  Upon arrival to the apartment, a welcome basket filled with treats and wine was waiting, which was a special touch. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Nicholas place in Athens and would stay again upon return."

The kitchen is equipped with basic cookware. Maybe the most interesting part of the flat is it's second floor! If you go upstairs, there is a room with a dining table, bathroom and a big terrace, from where you can watch the Acropolis. This is truly a magnificient place and there is also a small Bluetooth speaker, which you can take outside to let you enjoy the scenery even more.

21933793,267026520,2018-05-21,57053174,Freya,"The apartment is an oasis in a busy city and located blocks from the Acropolis so it is centrally located and walking distance to many wonderful restaurants, museums, shops and the metro.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Athens, thanks to Nicolas and Marina.<br/>I highly recommend this  place.  It is  super spacious, clean light and airy, decorated in a lovely, modern and comfortable way with great art and plants.   The top floor deck at night is wonderful to relax with a bottle of wine, the sound bar and has a  a magnificent view of the Acropolis all lit up.<br/>Nicolas really went out of his way to be the most hospitable host.  Both he and Marina are wonderful!"
21933793,270999024,2018-05-31,171317963,Charmaigne,"The accommodation was centrally located and within walking distance of many of the main attractions in Athens (Acropolis, Temple of Zeus,  Olympic Stadium, Syntagma Square). The view from the penthouse of the Acropolis at night was breathtaking. <br/>Even though the apartment was on a busy road we couldn’t hear the traffic. <br/>The apartment was clean and what you see in the photos on the website is what you get. The place was stunning."

Lots of welcoming little touches - water waiting in the fridge, soaps, etc. We loved it and would absolutely stay again! Especially for the very reasonable price"
21933793,292066667,2018-07-17,166859677,Van,"One block from the Akropolis Museum and the Plaka, Nicholas’ fourth floor apartment is centrally located and has a great view. It is modern, well-maintained and a very comfortable place to return to after exploring Athens all day. <br/><br/>Nicholas was very helpful in orienting us to restaurants in the Plaka, Monastiraki, and Koukaki, and arranging transportation for the five of us. Athens taxis only seat four passengers. Would definitely recommend this top notch property and host to anyone wanting a prime location in Athens. "
21933793,297503060,2018-07-28,15789148,Michael,"We had an excellent stay at an amazing location with a great view and a short walk to Plaka and Acropolis. The kitchen is small, but perfect for our needs. Nice touches were:<br/>-The option transportation from the airport with a wonderful driver. If you are tight on time its worth organizing transportation with Takis for sightseeing too; we had a great driver, Nasos!<br/>-There is also a locker to store your luggage if you need to checkout, but have the afternoon in town (as we did). We were able to ever the building and pick up our luggage from the locker hours after we checked out.<br/><br/>Thank you for an excellent stay in your amazing city!"

There were five of us and plenty of spaces to walk around and put our luggages away. We arrived early in the day and Nicholas was able to let us keep our luggages in a safe place. The unit was clean and cool. Nicholas was very easy to get in touch with using (Hidden by Airbnb) . We had one issue with the drawer that fell (luckily no one got hurt) and Nicholas was able to put an immediate work request. Overall, we were more than satisfied that we stayed at his unit! "

So easy to walk to great shops, the museum, restaurants and, of course, The Acropolis. The apartment was spacious and well appointed. Everything was in great working order. We were all very impressed with the rooms, the artwork, the penthouse balcony.....we will definitely stay here again, as we visit family in Greece often. Do not hesitate to stay in this apartment. It was a great value and a great stay. Also, our driver to and from the airport, Christo, was excellent. His van was immaculate, he was right on time, very helpful and his English was great. Thanks for making or short visit to Athens a pleasure. "

21933793,343290113,2018-10-31,72030099,Mark,"Nicholas's place is just across a main road from both the Acropolis Museum and the Temple of Zeus Olympian.  Initially the area looks a bit industrial but within 5 minutes you are in the scenic Plaka area near all the major exhibits.  We liked the location.<br/>Despite the main road, the apartment is quiet and we slept really well during the stay.  It's a really nice place with three bedrooms around a kitchen and living area.  There is a separate room upstairs (outside the main apartment) with views of the Acropolis.<br/>A few welcome treats were much appreciated.  We would stay again."
21933793,346587908,2018-11-09,70419977,Lissa,"An amazing place to stay in the heart of Athens. The space is very nice, beds were comfortable, and we had everything we needed (and then some!). The private access to the rooftop deck was also a great bonus. Nicholas was a good host - very good communication. Easy check-in and check-out instructions. I would definitely stay here again with a small group!"

Super schön eingerichtet Wohnung mit alles was man braucht, sehr sauber und seht vielleicht noch besser als auf die Bilden aus!<br/>Der Gastgeber war sehr flexibel beim Einchecken und berücksichtigte unser Wünsche. <br/>vielen Dank noch mal für alles (weinen war einfach super) und wir würden jederzeit gerne wieder so eine 5 Sternen Wohnung nutzen! <br/><br/>An incredibly beautiful apartment in the center of Athens.

21933793,352948130,2018-11-26,123844121,Tomasz,"It was difficult to make optimal temperature. It was once too cold, once too hot. The water pressure was really low in the shower. It was annoying to boil hot water in advance before taking a shower. Location is great. All the rest really good, as stated in the description."
21933793,355892582,2018-12-06,17297004,Tobias,"Perfect location, stunning place - very friendly and welcoming Nicholass. Very helpful host. Just like every Airbnb stay should aspire to be!"

The kitchen was minimally equipped.  The space was big enough to fit our family  of 8 and the location is very close to the tourist areas and the metro.  The host was very accommodating with early checkin when possible and had a space to leave the luggage after check out."

21933793,402688744,2019-01-19,45410900,Ranin,"We had a great stay in Athens! Thank you Nicholas for allowing us to stay at your lovely apartment. Everything went well, from communication to all the much-needed amenities at your property. The hot water situation was a little tricky at first but after we figured it out, it was all good. The only thing that we didn't like was the smell of cigarette smoke from someone smoking within the building in the middle of the night. I understand that this was not your fault at all, but it was such a nuisance. But all in all, it was a great stay and totally recommend Chloe apartment to someone visiting Athens!"

21933793,419921248,2019-03-05,70362898,Ana Belen,"El apartamento se encuentra en una ubicación inmejorable.  Próximo a una parada de metro y autobús. También posee cerca una de las paradas de los autobuses turísticos por lo que el desplazarte no es ningún problema. A dos calles de la entrada secundaria de la acrópolis y su museo. <br/>El apartamento es amplio y dispone de todo lo necesario para pasar un par de días en la ciudad. La cocina es algo pequeña y no dispone de mucho menaje pero existe una gran variedad de restauración por la zona y muchos locales tienen take away para poder disfrutar de la terraza. <br/>La terraza se encuentra en el piso superior, no tiene acceso desde el interior del piso por lo que se accede desde las escaleras del edificio con entrada independiente. Las vistas son excelentes y dispone de mesas y sillas tanto en la parte cubierta como en la exterior."
21933793,424203395,2019-03-16,23175728,David,"Simply amazing. Nicholas place was great, gorgeously decorated and big.  He replied very fast and made us feel like we were at home but also at a holiday. The view from the terrace is perfect."
21933793,425821774,2019-03-19,214794182,Troy,Nicholas's apartment was fantastic! Only a 5 minute walk to the Plaka and the Acropolis Museum. The apartment was perfect for our party of 7 with everyone having a comfortable place to sleep. I can't say enough good things about this apartment and the hospitality that Nicholas offered.  I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in Athens.
21933793,426791890,2019-03-22,246787441,Tetiana,Огромное спасибо за прекрасные апартаменты!  Удобное расположение в центре Афин. Свежий ремонт. Чистота. Чудесный дизайн. 2 санузла. 3 спальни. Великолепный холл с мини кухней и всем необходимым. Нас было 6 человек. Все остались очень довольными.  Благодарим за радушный прием!!
21933793,432838957,2019-04-05,65818543,Doug,"Nicholas's place is great! We would definitely try to stay here again the next time we visit Athens. Big, clean, nicely furnished and equipped place, and the location is great to see all the main sites.  Easy to get to from the airport, we took the metro.  And the private rooftop patio space is a fantastic way to finish a day of siteseeing with a cold beer or wine and watching the sunset over the Acropolis."
21933793,433327651,2019-04-06,21874453,Madeline,Great location and gorgeously decorated apartment! Nicholas also communicates consistently and the place is spacious.
21933793,436943722,2019-04-14,5457262,Maria,"Very nice apartment, with a fantastic view from a penthouse above and at an excellent location!<br/>We were a company of 7 girls and had a great time there! Although the building is very old and looks ugly from outside, the apartment is renovated and with a modern decoration.<br/>It is spacious (although slightly smaller than it looks at the photos) and it can accommodate 7-8 people, since the sofa becomes a double bed (it is comfortable).<br/>The photos showing a balcony are not from the main apartment, but from a penthouse above (separate door), that was for our use too.<br/>The owner is very polite - he even let us check-in earlier in a rainy day - and responds instantly.<br/>We only has some minor issues with the cleanness (coffee machines, under the sofa, etc.), but I am sure that the owner will fix them. Also we could not operate 2 of the air-conditions, but he was very eager to help us with that (finally we did not insist us we did not need them at the end).<br/>The locations is perfect. Very close to Acropolis metro station, Acropolis museum and Dionisiou Aeropagitou street. There is a city super market across the street, and some mini markets around it. Also, it is located at the area of Koukaki, where many restaurants and bars have opened the last years.<br/>So, I would recommend it for a company of friends that want to do some sightseeing and also discover the nightlife of Athens."
21933793,453616320,2019-05-16,54481863,Jane,"A super apartment! Nicholas went out of his way to arrange transfers and the flat was very well positioned right next to the Acropolis new museum and with a view of the Acropolis. We had a lovely  open plan dining, cooking and sitting area and good bathroom facilities - really enjoyed our stay."
21933793,455786314,2019-05-20,7217835,Kristin,Amazing location and outstanding view of the Parthenon from the rooftop! We absolutely loved this place for our group! Nicholas has excellent communication and was able to set up a driver for our group from the airport. Highly recommend this place.
21933793,456279720,2019-05-21,80795087,Airma,"Nicholas' home is lovely & sparkling clean. Great location just 10 minutes walking to the Plaka & Acropolis entrance.  It is located at a very busy intersection so if you want to enjoy the rooftop patio, the view is amazing, but very noisy.  When you are inside the home it is quiet.  The house is beautifully furnished with huge TV & Netflix, which is a nice luxury in Athens. The beds are great, linens & pillows are comfortable, bathroom amenities very nice, living area is light & spacious. 3rd bedroom is actually a child's room with 2 single beds.  The mattresses in this room are really not very comfortable for an adult."
21933793,460393999,2019-05-29,101650548,Esteban,"The apartment is big, has plenty of place for a big group (we were 5 adults). Good location and an awesome view from the terrace. Nicholas was very helpful with arranging the transportation to and from the airport."

21933793,471179855,2019-06-17,113291185,Alyson,"We LOVED this place.  It surpassed our expectations!  We wish we had been in Athens longer to stay in this place longer.  It was stylish, with it's own personality, plenty of space, and the balcony area on 6th floor with the view of the Acropolis is beautiful!   We also loved that the air conditions worked well in every section of apartment (since we didn't always have that working in other airbnbs we stayed at during our trip).  We took a private car to this place, was located about 25-30 minutes from Athens airport and we got in late.  Ubers (which uses taxis are also a great way to travel around Athens and we used for our return back to airport)."
21933793,472608991,2019-06-20,241443087,Natalie,"Nice flat with good amenities, comfortable beds, and an awesome private balcony. Host set out informational brochures and maps that were neat and helpful. Clean and luxurious shower. The private balcony has a clear view of the Parthenon which we gazed at at night while we drank some Greek wine- I recommend doing that."

La pièce principale est très agréable, la climatisation est efficace... L'intérieur moderne et cosy contraste un peu avec les parties communes un peu sales et vétustes (notamment l'ascenseur qui fait un peu peur). Belle vue sur l'Acropole, mais à noter qu'il faut monter à l'étage pour la voir (il y a une pièce supplémentaire qui fait aussi partie de la location). La cuisine est minimaliste, il y a juste une plaque chauffante et un micro-ondes, pas de quoi cuisiner pour une famille mais ce n'est pas un problème vu la proximité de tràs nombreux restaurants.<br/>Nicholas a été très précis dans ses communications et désireux de tout faire pour faciliter notre installation. Nous sommes arrivés en soirée et avec un peu de retard mais le transfert que nous avons réservé par son intermédiaire a été ponctuel et efficace ! Adresse à recommander."

21933793,449740188358273931,2021-09-12,74913162,Andrew,"Perfect location. Worn out furnishings. The location of the apartment couldn’t have been better with a short walk to the town center and Acropolis. Nicholas was a great host and responded quickly about any questions or recommendations we had. I don’t believe the pictures are recent, as some of the furnishings are different/greatly worn. The porch that has the Acropolis view is on a separate floor than the apartment you stay in. The furniture on the porch was also out of date and seemed to not be the same as shown in the pictures. I have stayed in many airbnb’s and this certainly wasn’t the worst, but I don’t believe it lives up the 4.9 star rating."

A walk from the main train station then just 15 mins walk early morning for the bus to Delphi. This alone saved much time, money and avoided stress of more travel with bags etc."

The apartment first of all is next to the station Attiki which serves 2 lines(underground+overground) and the centre is 5 minutes away. The flat was sparkling clean and had all the house appliances and air conditioning for the hot summer days. You have just down the building a mini market where you can buy drinks and snacks.

Incluso, pasamos un día entero de excursión con ella, nos llevó al Cabo Sounion y luego a la playa.  Como podéis ver, se trata de una anfitriona de diez. Por otra parte, el apartamento es tal y como aparece en las fotos, además esta muy bien comunicado con el centro de la ciudad y con el aeropuerto, ya que a 5 min hay una parada de metro, y la estación de bus está a unos 15 min. También existen comercios y tiendas en los alrededores donde poder hacer una compra. No duden en alojarse aquí! No se arrepentirán!"

It is in a very happening and lively neighbourhood, gardens, cafe's, bars, restaurants, shopping etc. You can walk to central Athens in about 20mins (to Syntagma square) and the touristy bits are all reachable from there on (doesn't have to go that far even). Christina is quite prompt in responding to messages, good at providing tips, and even helped me out once when I got locked out! Would recommend. "

21935648,305891356,2018-08-12,186729817,Maurizio,"Stare a casa di Christina nel  complesso è molto confortevole.  Zona piazza Pangrati, ottimo quartiere che offre molte possibilità di svago fino a notte fonda senza dover andare tutti i giorni in centro.  Per andare in centro è preferibile prendere gli autobus sono più linee, ad esempio a piazza Plastira credo che tutti gli autobus dopo poche fermate portano a piazza Syntagma che è il centro di Atene e ci sono autobus, filobus, tram, metropolitane e eccetera per andare dove vuoi.  Dopo le ore 24 puoi prendere l' autobus numero 11 che funziona 24 su 24 , penso che ci sono altri autobus di notte chiedete a Christina che è molto gentile, precisa e veloce nelle risposte. Quando arrivi con i bagagli dall' aeroporto prendi la metro e poi uno degli autobus che passano li vicino, anche questo chiedi a Christina che ti risponde volentieri e velocemente. Buona permanenza a tutri. <br/>"

21935648,316296646,2018-08-31,945867,Penelope,Christina’s place was just perfect for my stay in athens. The apt is very close to the trolley/bus stop which brings you straight to Syntagma. Also it’s only a 20 min walk to syntagma. Pangrati is a great neighborhood. It has many bars and restaurants and a super market very close by. <br/> The apartment was impeccable clean and very comfortable. I really wish I didn’t have to leave! Christiana went beyond the being a gracious host. She was so helpful and welcoming and friendly which is what the Greeks are known for!

21935648,337057774,2018-10-15,163092709,Claire,I would honestly highly recommend for all travelers to Athens. The Airbnb is easily within walking distance to all major sites and museums and also surrounded by all kinds of colorful restaurants and cafes. The space itself is kept sparkling clean and is very spacious! You cannot beat the value of Christina's place.

21935648,348834803,2018-11-15,13427001,Lee,"Do not stay at this apartment.  It's very old.  Very old and dilapidated: the furniture, the windows, bathroom, towels, etc.  There is a weird stench throughout the apartment that doesn't go away.  It took the host 3 days to service the air conditioner and the failing shower curtain. I caught a cold by staying there without heat.  More importantly, the way she spoke with me was very condescending and demeaning.  I have traveled to over 60 countries and this was one of the very few moments where I felt racial issues.  Not good.  Not sure how she is rated as a Superhost."

Answered every of my questions (and I had a lot), and every time I send her a message she reacted within a short time and even arrived within 10 minutes (when needed). <br/>The apartment is large, homey and well equipped. <br/>The street is quiet, everything is within walking distance. <br/>(To the center of athens its about 10 minuets walking). <br/>Shops / restaurants / food / cell phones / supermarkets and bus stops are only 2 minutes from the apartment.<br/>And in the apartment there is papers that Christina made, important numbers to call, and the maps of the area. <br/>I had an amazing vacation, hope to come back soon to athens and to Christina❤️"

Μας ενημέρωσε για ότι τον ρωτήσαμε και ήταν κατατοπιστικός σε όλα. Το σπίτι αρκετά μεγάλο, φωτεινό, με όλες τις ανέσεις και πολύ ζεστό. <br/>Ο Ηλίας μας είχε μια μεγάλη ποικιλία από ροφήματα και πρωινό!!!! Έχω πληρώσει πολλά παραπάνω χρήματα για σπίτια πολύ κατώτερα και χωρίς καν λίγο καφέ....<br/>Η πρόσβαση στο μετρό είναι απίστευτα εύκολη (5 μόλις λεπτά) και η συγκεκριμένη στάση βολική προς όλες τις κατευθύνσεις. <br/>Ηλία σε ευχαριστούμε πολύ και σίγουρα θα τα ξαναπούμε σύντομα!"

Hay tiendecitas donde comprar comida por toda la calle, así como un par de locales para cenar, aunque sería todo para salir del paso. Es mejor buscar un supermercado e intentar cenar en otros sitios para disfrutar de la comida griega. <br/>En cuanto al comportamiento del anfitrión, inmejorable. Muy agradecidos por su atención y nos hizo el favor de dejar las maletas en la casa hasta cuando tuvimos que partir. <br/>Para volver a altas horas de la noche se recomienda Uber, que desde el centro no sale a más de 5 o 6 euros en total.<br/>Como dato, el metro es un cachondeo y parece ser que la gente no paga, o eso nos pareció. Fue un gasto tonto pagar unos 40 euros entre 3 para movernos por la ciudad.<br/>Un bonito detalle del piso es el tema de las hierbas para infusiones que Elias te ofrece, aparte de varios tipos de café que hay siempre a tu disposición en la cocina.<br/>¡Muy aconsejable!"

21936481,271000434,2018-05-31,6247293,Ursula,"Elias war ein zuvorkommender Gastgeber, der jederzeit erreichbar war. Die saubere geräumige Wohnung liegt in einem lebhaften Multikulti-Viertel, in dem ich problemlos bummeln konnte und viele interessante kleine Läden entdeckte. Zur Metrostation Attiki sind es zu Fuß nur 7 Minuten. Hier treffen sich die Metrolinien 1 und 2. Der Bahnhof Larissa ist nur eine Station entfernt und im Herzen von Athen,  Omonia und Syntagma ist man auch rasch. Auch fußläufig fand ich eine kleine Garküche (Spitiki Kouzina), die Hausmannskost anbietet. Die Speisen kann man auch in die Wohnung bestellen. Die Speisekarte ist allerdings in griechischer Sprache aufgeschrieben. Es lohnt sich dort hinzugehen und sich aus den täglich wechselnden Gerichten, die appetitlich im Fensterthresen ausgestellt sind, etwas auszusuchen. Sie sind hausgemacht und auch preisgünstig. <br/>Ich verbrachte einige schöne Tage in Elias Wohnung und würde beim nächsten Besuch gerne wieder dort wohnen.  <br/>Ursula"

He showed us the apartment, told the most important ones, and gave a review of the operation of the apartment's machines and useful phone numbers. (The info on the taxi company was useful) Cleaning agents, detergent, iron, garbage bag, coffee all kinds of, tea, sugar, honey, spices were available. Metro stop is approx. 10 minutes on foot, separate on the red and green (land surface) line. It's not downtown, but it's just a couple of stops. The neighborhood of the apartment is not dangerous, and in the evenings we traveled quietly. There are small shops nearby and a bread shop at the corner of the street approx. 300 meters away. The flat is on the first floor, there is a lift, but climbing on the mezzanine level. Very comfortable apartment. Entrance hall, living room with large dining table, kitchen, two bedrooms, bathroom. Very comfortable beds. A little care would be in the apartment. These are not great things. A map would be nice, ticking the metro stop, some sights. Overall good price value ratio. thanks for everything Elias."

Llegamos muy temprano en barco a Atenas y nos dejó hacer check in inmediatamente, lo que es algo poco común en airbnb, que por lo general no te dejan ingresar hasta después del mediodía. La cocina está equipada para cocinar y además Elias dejó un aceite de oliva, vinagre, un montón de deliciosas hierbas para hacerse té y cocinar (como orégano, Rosemary, pimienta) y además para el desayuno nos dejó unas tostadas, manteca y mermelada, espectacular! El departamento es enorme, hay aire acondicionado en cada cuarto y en el living y Elias siempre está a disposición por tips locales o cualquier inquietud.

He went extra miles to provide us with local tips, a tour around the apartment even in the early morning (we checked in about 1:30am), and some bakery for breakfast. The little touches really impressed us. <br/><br/>The apartment is large with two bedrooms and lovely living room. You can even play boardgames there. Extra blankets are provided too. The room temperature is adjustable easily. The only little suggestion for the shower head is it would be ideal to be able to have it fixed on top as it is not always convenient to hold it with a hand, but it is no big deal. Shampoo, conditioners and Body sopa are provided I also noticed that there are sunscreen and other small personal hegien items provided, very considerate.<br/><br/>The location is within 10 minutes walk to subway and 5 minutes walk to bus stop. It is very close to a local morning street market every Wednesday! Freshest produces with amazing price!  A lot of restaurants, barbershops, gas station, and other variety of shops around. <br/><br/>I strongly recommend this and will stay there again for my next visit!"

The apartment is reasonably equipped and in a central location, 10 min away from Attiki station, 16 min away from Larissa station. The board game and the tea collections were a nice plus. It is in a working class, vibrant immigrant neighborhood, with 2 weekly farmers markets nearby. It has three AC units, one of which can be a bit loud at times (the one in the 2 single bed bedroom)Elias was very fast in resolving issues and offered even a discount when we considered extending the reservation for an extra month, which we did gladly. He also fixed one of the ACs after its fuse blew up during a heatwave. Downsides: The kitchen could be better equipped for long stays. There were no food storage containers, no microwave, and the pans and pots could be in a better state.  Similarly the internet could be faster and the tree by the front balcony better trimmed. The TV had a thick line of white pixels right in the middle of the screen; knowing about it before booking would have been helpful. Paying about 1000 euros a month for an apartment with a broken TV strikes me as a little disappointing."

Elias' very nice and excellent value-for-money flat served as suitable accommodation for us during this time. The two bedrooms face an inner yard, which is much quieter than the living room, which has a window facing the street. The bathroom and kitchen offer everything important that one needs in a temporary accommodation. The furnishings correspond to the photos and are very clean. There is a small table with an ashtray on the front balcony and clotheslines on the back balcony to hang washed clothes to dry.<br/>The flat is less than 5 minutes walk from Attiki station, from where you can get to anywhere in the city centre in no time. All kinds of important everyday shops are also in the immediate vicinity. Particularly worth mentioning, however, are the weekly markets, which are always worth a stroll, and where you can get all kinds of very fresh vegetables and the like for very cheap money.<br/><br/>Whenever I come to Athens again, I will definitely keep this flat in mind!"

21942566,268482096,2018-05-25,150803272,Shanila,Great location!
21942566,269208314,2018-05-27,63390610,Dragan,"Toni's place is very clean, walking distance to Acropolis. He was very accommodating regarding our check in."
21942566,270997591,2018-05-31,32849221,D.,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt bei Toni der mit einer ausführlichen Einführung in die Wohnung begann. Super ausgestattet und alles modern eingerichtet. Das Apartment liegt sehr verkehrsgünstig und man kann alle Sehenswürdigkeiten gut zu Fuß erreichen. Leider ist das Apartment dadurch auch etwas laut, da die Bahn unmittelbar vor der Tür langfährt und eine Café neben dem Haus sich befindet. Ansonsten netter und schneller Kontakt. Absolut zu empfehlen."
21942566,273743509,2018-06-07,157542841,Rhiannon,"Very lovely place to stay! Was conveniently located to 2 different metro stations, so very easy to get wherever you need to go!"
21942566,276255956,2018-06-13,22942726,Manuella,"I couldn’t have chosen a better place to stay on my first visit to Athens. Location is perfect, the apartment is perfect, the amenities like the Korres bathroom amenities and coffee machine and pods were very thoughtful. I loved these little touches. The apartment is also very clean and safe. We walked everywhere, the apartment is really close to the centre so no need for a car at all and also just a short walk from the train station. The location makes you fell a truly local. There is a great bar next door that is open till late for a nice cold greek beer and also a tavern just two blocks away that is famous for the lamb. Really worth a try.  The host hospitality and his response time is amazing. Every question i had before and during my stay was responded promptly. The check in was also very smooth, even though my flight was delayed and I arrived way after the time I had planned. Make sure to stay here if you decide to come to Athens! "
21942566,276913006,2018-06-15,25711413,George,Everything was as described ! Perfect location & spacy for two persons!
21942566,285239556,2018-07-03,187905782,Min,"Toni and his team are very friendly and responsive.  The flat is perfect and you feel it is like your home. Spacious, clean, newly refurbished, sufficient amenities, good mattress and bedding. Check in was smooth. Though we are late for 40 min as boat delay, the staff still awaited at the gate to welcome us.  EVERYTHING is perfect except noise which is not described in the webpage. It is near train line and event park. We stayed at weekend and were lucky to meet an event."
21942566,289025089,2018-07-11,16521029,Sofia,Great stylish apartment footsteps away from the historical center. 
21942566,289314228,2018-07-12,76428953,Ashleigh,The apartment is very clean and looks exactly like the pictures. It’s located in a very good and safe area but it is next to a train line so you do hear trains go by from time to time. It’s great for a short stay in Athens.
21942566,291677548,2018-07-16,63922554,Brandon,"We very much enjoyed staying at Toni's apartment! The neighborhood felt safe and was only a 5-10 minute walk to the Market Place and tons of restaurants not to mention a Metro Station. The space was clean, well organized and had everything you might need for your trip and more. Even a full cooking set.<br/><br/>If you're going to Athens and you can handle a few stairs to get to your apartment door, then I would book Toni's place without hesitation."
21942566,293780526,2018-07-21,141504592,Shannon,"Very neat and modern apartment in an up and coming area in Greece, close to the train station. "
21942566,297122793,2018-07-27,10495353,Ania,"Highly recommend a stay at this apartment. Location wise it was about a 10- 15  minute walk to Monastiraki Square ( depending on your pace ) and a scenic walk past the Ancient Agora with views of the Acropolis and  lovely cafes and restaurants. In the other direction you are less than 10 mins walk from the Gazi district. It is a 5 min walk to Thissio Station which is 20 mins ( same line)  from Piraeus station if you are heading to the port. <br/>The actual apartment itself has been renovated and has comfortable modern furniture. Some nice touches are the coffee machine and pods ,high quality shampoo and soaps, and washing machine. "
21942566,298355272,2018-07-29,70635605,Patrick,"Clean and modern, short walk to major sites"
21942566,300388886,2018-08-02,517046,Bruce,"Toni's apartment is central to all tourist facilities and public transport, with a number of great restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The apartment was very clean and tidy, with all amenities you would need for a short stay. We were well looked after by Toni's team, with good communication maintained throughout. Overall one of the best Airbnb's we have stayed in so far."
21942566,303329021,2018-08-07,177372571,Emma,"God beliggenhed alt ligger indenfor en rimelig gå afstand. Beboere i nærheden er venlige. Der ligger en rigtig hyggelig og lokal restaurent tæt på, ved siden af kirken på vej ned mod parken. <br/><br/>Vær opmærksom på, at der kører toge lige ved siden af terrassen, derfor forekommer der lidt larm, som for os ikke voldte problemer, men som kan for andre. <br/><br/>Toni’s lejlighed er moderne, fin og indrettet på bedste vis og er perfekt for 2-3 mennesker. Min kæreste og jeg nød vores ophold i lejligheden."
21942566,306720395,2018-08-13,128203496,Agi,The apartment is the perfect start to discover the city by foot or public transportation. As I was travelling alone I was feeling really safe in the neighborhood. 
21942566,310807458,2018-08-20,96289634,Wai Sun,"Toni's house is great, location is quite convenient, and you can find all the basics in his house."
21942566,312858276,2018-08-24,10289035,Alessandro,"Toni was really helpful during our staying. We had a problem with the flight and he was always available to find solutions for the check-in.  The house was fully equipped, very clean and with a modern and comfortable taste. It’s very bright with a nice balcony and new furniture! The position was perfect close to every interesting area. I would highly recommend this flat!"
21942566,314051572,2018-08-26,110509147,Monika,"Toni's place is really perfect - it is close to the restaurants, bars, but at the same time not in the middle of the noisy area. It is also few minutes walk to reach the metro station. The apartment itself is nicely decorated, very clean and with very comfortable bed. In this place you have everyhing that you would need while visiting Athens. From time to time you can hear the train passing but it is not problematic in any way. Without any doubt I can recommend Toni's place for those who want to visit Athens"
21942566,317511119,2018-09-02,58460819,Yasmin,"Lovely apartment in a very convenient area for tourists. The only downside is the level of noise in the evening and night time, there is a club nearby that plays loud music throughout the night which is audible from the flat. There is also a bar next door and a train track across the road."
21942566,318621413,2018-09-04,45124581,Klaas,Very nice apartment at a 15min walk from the city center. <br/>The host was very nice and I could even check-in a bit earlier then first expected. <br/>Be aware that the apartment is directly next to the railroad which you hear a lot. There were also 2 concert halls in the neighbourhood which had 2 concerts at the time at my stay which gave a lot of noise till late in the night (1pm). <br/>Very nice apartment with a very nice host but a pity the windows are not better isolated against noise.
21942566,322770871,2018-09-14,61279362,David,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights (Sept 2018). The place was spotless, really spacious and modern. Even the balcony was huge. The place was equipped with every amenity you could possibly need - free strong WiFi, washer, hairdryer, Nespresso machine, air-con, iron & ironing board to name but a few. We were welcomed in person and provided with information on the apartment and the surrounding locality. The apartment is located 5 minutes walk from Thissio metro station. Thissio is conveniently located for metro to airport/port. There are many restaurants/cafés/bars very close to the apartment. There is also a café/bar directly next door. Also the location is perfectly situated for visiting the tourist sites of the Acropolis etc. Close to the popular neighbourhoods of Plaka and Monastiraki too. As the metro station is nearby the apartment you can hear the trains, but you can't be near the metro station and not hear trains! Everything about this apartment is location, location, location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. It was perfect and we would recommend it 100% to other travellers. You will not be disappointed."
21942566,324857167,2018-09-18,130281858,Marc,"really nice place, very clean and modern. very good and quick communication. would definately recommend the place"
21942566,325624826,2018-09-20,37436206,Felix,"we had a great 2-night-stay at this apartment!<br/>late check-in was no problem.<br/>place is well located near Metro station Kerameikos and gave us the flexibilty to explore the nice neighbourhoods nearby as Monastiraki, Gaza & Psiri by foot.<br/>We had a warm welcome and were given all necessary information about our stay.<br/>Appartment itself is newly renovated, even better equipment than we needed!<br/>Checkout was simple as well. <br/><br/>Huge thumps up for this place!"
21942566,331293013,2018-10-02,32876835,Daniel,"Pros: <br/>(1) Good location, next to almost everything; <br/>(2) Well decorated;<br/>(3) The neighborhood is quite nice and safe, with lovely café bar and local restaurants in walking distance (less than 5 mins).<br/>(4) Toni and his team are responsible and the communication is good and fast;<br/>(5) Worth the money.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>(1)	Water heater is a big issue for us, because every time you want to use hot water, you have to turn the switch on and wait at least 30 mins, then you get 5-10 mins’ hot water for the shower, which is not enough even for a single person;<br/>(2)	The noise is really loud, because the apartment is only 10-20 meters away from railway; and in the night there are often some kind of musical events or late-night bars, which are quite annoying.<br/><br/>All in all, this may be a good choice for people with limited budget. But for us, we will not choose it again."
21942566,332335243,2018-10-05,19898344,Ashley,Nice and clean. Felt safe and Toni provided excellent communication with me. I would definitely recommend!

21942566,339866917,2018-10-22,191486813,Stylianos,The apartment was amazing. Everything was clean. It is close by the beautiful hotspots in the city. The communication between the host and me was very good. <br/>When I come next time to Athens i will book the apartment again.
21942566,341990561,2018-10-28,128819225,Sofia,Everything was great!! The apartment was perfect and the host really understanding and willing to help us. I recommend it

21942566,350726313,2018-11-20,118383923,Stevie,"Very nice flat, Toni is a great host and it is centrally located. Unfortunately the hot water ran out after about 3/4 mins usage which was extremely annoying. We stayed for 5 nights and it was the same every day. The area itself that the flat is located in is not very nice, lots of teenagers hanging around the street drinking etc. Overall 3/5"
21942566,355189385,2018-12-03,25087639,Smara,This apartment in Athens is just amazing. Great location: within walking distance of all must see spots and close to bars and restaurants. It is very stylish and clean and it was just perfect that we got to stay here.
21942566,355669127,2018-12-05,51112839,Sally,"Toni’s place was amazing. We communicated before our arrival and it was super easy. The apartment was a little hard to find at first, but it’s very conveniently located to the metro. It’s a nice walk from the apartment to Plaka and the Acropolis. The hot water had to be turned on 30 minutes before and doesn’t stay hot if you shower back to back. But other than that, I would definitely stay there again and recommend to others. Toni’s place was clean, comfortable and welcoming."
21942566,357372370,2018-12-10,8017550,Martyna,It was a pleasure staying at your place! Everything looked like at the photos. Great location!

21942566,415604438,2019-02-23,101807898,Lisa,This apartment was a lovely space for my friend and I on our stay in Athens. It was within reasonable walking distance of many attractions. There are plenty of shops and restaurants within a close distance as well. Checking in was a breeze and we were met at the apartment and given lots of information and tips about how to enjoy our time there. There are lots of little touches that made the space functional and enjoyable. We would happily stay again in the future.
21942566,417689570,2019-02-28,162799763,James,"The apartment was modern and contemporary yet created a feeling of homeliness, genuinely felt upset having to leave the apartment and Athens. Would definitely recommend :)"

Окна выходят к линии метро, но нам шум совсем не мешал. Рядом есть супермаркет и неплохая пекарня. В квартире чисто и есть все необходимое. Хозяин приветлив, любезен и разрешил заехать в квартиру чуть раньше. Рекомендую!"
21942566,425842434,2019-03-19,83906921,Sarah,"Very nice apartment in an easily accessible part of town! It's far enough from downtown that there aren't a crazy amount of people around, but close enough to walk to literally everything. The trains across the street runs until midnight, but with the blinds closed on the doors, it didn't bother us at all!<br/><br/>While we were checking in, they helped us arrange a transfer ride to the airport for our very early flight out of Athens. The driver was early, it was reasonably priced, and made our last day/morning stress-free.<br/><br/>Remembering to turn on the water heater before our showers was something to get used to, but we ended up just setting an alarm 30 minutes before when we wanted to wake up and it worked perfectly!<br/><br/>We would definitely recommend Toni's place just for the hospitality and the helpfulness of his team with arranging the ride to the airport, but being a 15 minute walk from all of the sights really made it."
21942566,428931900,2019-03-26,23842500,Ilaria,"L'appartamento è nel cuore di Atene, 5 minuti a piedi dalla fermata Θησείο.  È arredato con gusto e molto funzionale. Nota positivissima è il bagno e doccia, elementi spesso sottovalutati ad Atene, e la pulizia."
21942566,429827877,2019-03-29,2443151,Yap,Good place.. just beware of the noise from the trains? Other than that.. awesome place and location! Do spend a bit of time walking from here to the agora and syntagma square.. the walk is pleasant :)
21942566,432918217,2019-04-05,120097618,Angela,This was a great place to stay! The location was perfect for waking everywhere and the metro was also close by. The Korres toiletries were a nice touch.

It's in a great location and I would highly recommend it for others.<br/>Thank you Toni!"

21942566,481187777,2019-07-04,170710556,Robin,"The service provided by Toni was second to none.  We had a massively delayed flight, and Toni showed complete flexibility in assisting us with airport transfer and checkin, so incredibly helpful every step of the way.  The flat is fabulous, and is exactly as advertised.  Bonus: a lovely wine bar literally outside the front door; this went down very well indeed when we arrived late at night!"
21942566,482242451,2019-07-06,166277144,Matilde,"I really enjoyed staying at Toni’s. The place was sparkling clean, modern, with a realllly good balcony and everything I needed. There was a great establishment literally right downstairs where I was able to grab a drink. Location is right by metro, really convenient. I took taxi into city but also walked there. All in all, a really great experience and I hope to be back and use Toni’s place again. There’s a wonderful bakery a couple of blocks up that I really liked!"

21942566,490098637,2019-07-18,160095782,Kate,"Toni’s place is a wonderful apartment in a great location, nearby to the city centre, but not right in the heart. Toni’s communication is excellent, with giving us directions on how to get to and from the airport. The check in was easy, with no issues. The apartment was clean and tidy. Unfortunately, the hot water did run out quickly. And music could be heard until early hours of the morning from nearby places. But still an enjoyable stay."
21942566,491314261,2019-07-20,66841610,Pranjal,"Nice clean place to stay. Next to train tracks and a bar just downstairs, so can be noisy on weekend but Toni has done a great job with the place to mute the sounds. 15 mins walk to Acropolis, 6-8 min walk to first sight of it. Nice neighborhood, great bars and coffee places around. Toni and his team made our stay very comfortable. Highly recommend."
21942566,494869956,2019-07-25,102622124,Angelica,"Toni’s place is very nice and stylish and in a perfect location. Few meters away from a famous traditional restaurant and of course close to Akropolis, Plaka, Thisio and other historical places. We really enjoyed our stay there! Thank you Toni!"
21942566,496987672,2019-07-28,31350818,Pantelis,Thank you very much for everything! A very nice apartment in the heart of Athens! Anything you could ask for in a very good price. My guests loved it!

21942566,501857804,2019-08-04,66177131,Emma,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay at Toni’s place. We really appreciated the quick responses and how Toni organised a transfer to the port for us as we had an early ferry to catch. The flat is great, especially the powerful shower! The location was perfect, a short walk to lots of restaurants with a beautiful view of the pantheon and round the corner is an amazing little bakery. Easy to get to from the airport as a short walk to the metro station. We had a brilliant time and would definitely stay there again."
21942566,502942242,2019-08-05,9461558,Jay,"Toni’s place is better than advertised. Perfect location for sightseeing, or if you want to have a drink in a very vibrate Athens nightlife scene. The space was clean, spacious and comforting. I will definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place in Athens."
21942566,504067833,2019-08-07,278465997,Eirini,I had a lovely time in Toni's place. The location was very convenient and close to the underground. It was a walking distance from all the archaeological sites we wanted to visit. The house was outstanding and equipped with everything. The place was absolutely spotless and clean. The communication with the host was fast and friendly. I had such a great time and If I was going back I would choose nothing else but Toni's place.
21942566,508615421,2019-08-13,24898189,Ashish,Very nice and modern place near to all major attractions of Athens. Toni and his team are very helpful and reply is instant for all your queries.
21942566,510382053,2019-08-16,271896642,Annette,It was just as pictured and would be the perfect location for a young couple to enjoy the thriving night life.
21942566,513117977,2019-08-19,40221515,Karthik Srivatsan,"Toni’s place was fantastic. A few great things were the central location which meant we could walk to all of the places of interest. Also, there are a number of great restaurants and bars nearby which make for a great evening. Toni was super helpful in arranging the pick up and drop, and was always super helpful! You can’t go wrong with your choice to stay here !"
21942566,513980095,2019-08-20,67434451,Julanda,"This 1 bedroom apt is absolutely beautiful. It is modern and has all the amenities needed from ACs to water heater to washing machine to even a safe! The interior design is especially beautiful and gives a sense of spaciousness and comfortability. <br/><br/>One thing I would add, is that the apartment is next to the train railway and can bit noisy at times.<br/><br/>Other than that the location is fairly close to city attractions and the Toni Team are exceptionally helpful. They also arranged for transportation from and to the airport in very comfortable cars (extra cost €38 standard per trip).<br/><br/>Thank you to the team for their hospitality. Definitely would consider your apartments when i’m in Athens Again! Tc"

21942566,533158154,2019-09-21,16774683,Judy,"A clean, comfortable and spacious apartment.  It is all as described and easy to get to the metro station or even walk in the centre. The Gazi area is funky with a great atmosphere. The noise from outside was reasonable for a big city however music from concerts at Technopolis was very loud. We weren't that bothered but if it would bother you, maybe check the concert programme.  Otherwise everything great and very professional."
21942566,535233356,2019-09-24,84084623,丰涩,"All perfect, location, facilities and most importantly Toni’s hospitality and feel like I am enjoying service as from a 5star hotel, if one thing to be mindful is the train is very close by but it didn’t bother me as I slept well during the night, maybe train stopped during night hours. Anyway highly recommended and will stay again."

We had to wait a few hours before we could check in, reasons were because they needed to fix some issues in the unit, which could have been done before. Saw the electrician in a different unit while they could have been working in ours before we came. Other than that the place was clean and as expected"

There are also great tips on what to visit and some city guides as well.<br/>What is not so positive is that the place is by the railroad, so you hear the trains all the time. And the air conditioning is too loud so we had to switch it off during the night even though it was cold in the apartment. <br/>However, our overall impression is positive and we would come back to Toni's."

With the closed windows (there is an A/C in each room) it wasn't bad, but light sleepers will have troubles. There is also a small cafe/pub downstairs, so people are outside (under your window) talking till quite late. Again, with the closed windows it wasn't bad"

Y únicamente a mejorar el tema del calentador ya que aunque seguiamos las indicaciones solamente teníamos 20 minutos de agua caliente en la ducha.<br/>El barrio en sí no tiene mucho encanto pero es seguro y en 5-10min andando llegas a una avenida de cafeterías con vistas muy bonita.<br/>Toni es encantador y nos facilitó entrar antes en el piso.

There were so many thoughtful touches - like leaving bottled water, wine, and delicious homemade cakes for us :) <br/><br/>The neighbourhood has so much character, it's full of interesting graffiti and art and has loads of restaurants, bars, and cafes. We were so happy to be in this neighbourhood over the crowded Plaka Monastakiri neighbourhoods.<br/><br/>An absolutely fantastic experience at Ioanna's place, and I would without a doubt stay here again and would recommend it to everyone!"

The area is where the universities are so there are lots of good and cheap pubs and cafes within 2 minutes of the apartment. You can walk to the Acropolis within 10-15 minutes and you are about 7 minutes from a metro stop. The hosts are exceptionally helpful and accommodating, with quick responses and nice touches to welcome you. The apartment is big so lots of places to put things if you are traveling with a family. Highly recommend this place for your visit to Athens."

There are plenty of restaurants and bakeries nearby but the apartment is always very quiet. The apartment has everything you might need, including a washer/dryer. The host was also super nice and thoughtful! She even informed us that the metro will go on strike the day we leave as soon as the news was announced, so we had plenty of time to prepare."

Spotlessly clean and facilities that allow you to be very self-sufficient. Also provided tea, coffee, sugar and milk as well as umbrellas or historical movies, all of which was a pleasant surprise.  During the winter time it is better to take slippers with you – the floor is quite cold. Anyway, totally recommend the place - great host Militsa, great facilities, great location. Couldn't have been any happier with our stay."

It is located right next to the Acropolis, but is in a really small and quiet street with no trafic at all. The apartment is extremely clean and so so cute! We loved it so much! The only downside of the apartment is that there is no view, as the apartment is lower than the street, but the apartment on itself will make up for it! Militsa has a lot of information about the city, transportation, taxi's, restaurants,... Thanks again Militsa for all your help and your quick responses! Would defenately recommend!"

In 5 minutes you are on the path around the Acropolis. You can walk everywhere! <br/>Militsa is an amazing host, very friendly and welcoming.  She has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and nothing is too much trouble. We were emailed lots of useful information prior to arrival and she always tried to find answers for our questions about places to visit. <br/>Highly recommended!"

It is also in the most perfect location being right next to the acropolis. We walked everywhere with no problem. Militsa was also very helpful with quick replies and suggestions for seeing the city. She also left us bottled water, juice, and cookies which was so nice. This has been one of my favorite airbnbs. I will definitely return to Militsa's place if I come back to Athens."
21948767,247313720,2018-03-28,41777401,Brian,"Militsa's place was great.  Close to the metro line, yet far enough away from the busier streets in a peaceful neighborhood.  The apartment was very well stocked with anything you may need.  There are bakeries, cafes and good restaurants all within a short walk.  The Acropolis and the Acropolis museum are only a few minutes away. Militsa met us upon arrival and walked us through everything we needed to know including restaurant recommendations, maps, guidebooks and even the phone number of a recommended taxi driver.  We were pleased with the location and enjoyed our three night stay.  I would not hesitate to stay there again.<br/><br/><br/>"

This place was much more than that. <br/>Located walking distance to the center of Athens and 2 of the main metro stations it was great to move around the city. Aside from that the apartment was really nicely decorated and very well equipped with so many things going far beyond the classic ""basic utensils usually provided."" The apartment is inside a somewhat old building, but completely remodeled and very clean. On top of that Militsa was quick to respond to all messages and questions, provided a transportation and basic info guide of the city a couple of days prior to our arrival, and waited for us past late check out time to great as at the apartment as our flight was delayed. She also greeted us with local snacks as well as a bottle of wine and water bottles in the fridge. Overall a great experience. Efcharistó Militsa!!"

Militsa nous avait même laissé des tranches de gâteau marbré délicieux et des petits jus d'orange pour le petit déjeuner !<br/>Elle nous avait envoyé plein d'informations avant (petite carte du quartier, recommandations sur les choses à voir, le festival de théâtre en cours, etc.). Il y avait même une clé USB avec plein de petits films sur Athènes, ses musées, l'histoire de l'Acropole, etc. <br/>La localisation est par ailleurs parfaite : à quelques minutes de marches de l'Acropole et des principaux sites d'Athènes, tout proche également du quartier de la Plaka plein de petits restaurants, bars et autres petits magasins.<br/>Une expérience exceptionnelle ! 1000 mercis !"

Militsa is super gracious and lovely, and there were loads of special touches throughout the apartment that made it homey and comfortable, and also very stylish.   I've seen tons of places that are tidy and 'sort of' clean, but this apartment sparkled."
21948767,322381369,2018-09-13,10620097,Talitha,"This place is really clean and roomie. The washer/dryer combo was convenient, even though it wouldn’t dry clothes completely. Local house phone is a nice touch. All menus she provided were in Greek. Shower was big and great. Very safe with double security doors. The main downfall is that there aren’t many restaurants within walking distance. The Acropolis is less than a 10 minute walk though."

There was useful tips about Athens in a little book which was great and the apartment was sparkling clean. She did everything she could to make it easy for us on the day of departure. Location was fabulous- only a short walk to the Acropolis and Plaka. Would definitely recommend!

There are metro lines accessible just a few short minutes away by foot. Upon entering the touches were as gentle as the host. European adapters, guestbook with recommendations, travel size soaps & lotions, USB history programming, and champs!! duh we will be back!"
21948767,338637397,2018-10-20,168718530,Ashley,We have stayed here twice and both times it has been AMAZING. 5 star doesn't even begin to describe this amazing apartment and host.

You can see from the photos that the apartment is stylish, but it was also incredibly clean and really felt like home. I managed to do laundry after a week on the road, and the bed was super comfy. The highlight of this apartment would have to be the amenities, including a welcome kit with assorted nibbles and drinks, and the fully stocked bathroom and laundry for everything you could need. Also, Militsa was really easy to communicate with and organise everything. Incredible!"

We can't thank her enough for her hospitality. she provided a list and directions for all the local restaurants and shops in the area. This location is perfect to stay because you are in the acropolis and there are several things to do walking distance. Militsa's place is very clean, modern and stylish.

21948767,367213586,2019-01-04,165469066,Arianna Lisa,"È stata una bellissima vacanza, ci siamo trovate benissimo e gli host, Militsa e suo marito, sono molto cordiali e disponibili, ci hanno fornito tutte le indicazioni necessarie sui mezzi di trasporto e sul quartiere in cui si trovava la casa.<br/>L'appartamento è meraviglioso e molto molto carino, con tutto il necessario per trascorrere una vacanza nella comodità assoluta. Non manca davvero niente! Addirittura abbiamo trovato il montalatte per il cappuccino!<br/>Come posizione, l'appartamento si trova a 5 minuti dall'Acropoli e dalla metro quindi é perfettamente collegato con il resto della città.<br/>Né io né la mia amica abbiamo trovato difetti e sicuramente sceglieremo di nuovo questo posto se dovessimo tornare ad Atene."
21948767,369323401,2019-01-10,77532845,Anaëlle,Everything was perfect : flat and location ! Thanks a lot
21948767,401300500,2019-01-14,58222171,Veronica,"This apartment is a jewel, very well situated in a perfectly quiet street despite being on the ground floor (important for sensitive sleepers). I like how Militsa decorated it, with a lot of attention to detail, and how exceptionally well-equipped this apartment is. This comes in handy when you can only travel with so much soaps and gels in your cabine luggage. Everything you might find yourself in need of, you will find at the apartment. The bed is large and comfortable, it is easy to regulate the temperature in both rooms and the shower is a true delight. I also very much enjoyed the apartment's closeness to the main historical sites, all walking distance away. Within a 5-10 minutes walk you will find an area with the little cafés and bars of Koukaki (there is a very good vegan + raw café called Peas). All in all, my stay at Militsa's place could not have been better. I definitely recommend this apartment if you are traveling alone or in couple."

We could have a small walk around Acropolis hill before sleep, when we were already tired to do other things in the City. The final stop of the City sightseeing bus was also near the flat.  Militsa was very nice host, gave us useful advices and information materials, including set of video on TV. If I come to Athenes again, I would like to stay in the same flat."

Many, many thoughtful touches, but most importantly a comfortable bed, and more hot water in the shower than you could ever use. Would definitely stay again as location is excellent as well. She arranged return to the airport for us as well, and driver was (at least) 15 minutes early - that’s when I checked. Excellent experience overall. A+++"

The apartment was very clean and very well equipped. We appreciated having access to the washer/dryer so we could come home with clean clothes.  Militsa provides a lot of very helpful information that aided our getting around in Athens.   She also recommended that we might enjoy going to the Athens festival and we got tickets to a great concert at an ancient theater in the Acropolis. I appreciated Militsa's very prompt responses to any questions.  I recommend this apartment without reservations to anyone coming to Athens.

We didn’t end up using the kitchen, but it looked well equipped. Best of all, the location is so convenient! It’s just a couple blocks from the pedestrian walking path that will take you right to the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum. It took about 7 or 8 minutes to walk to the Acropolis and to the metro.

21948767,387439976542815522,2021-06-18,31590768,Aya,"Militsa is by far the most deserving of her title of super host that i have ever come across. Immaculate even for the germophobic and obsessively cleanly me. Lovely taste: not too much useless clutter, not that typically greek ikea-cheapo furniture deco. You can tell she put a lot of energy and thought into providing her guests with everything they could possibly need: tupperware, super organised binder of recommended addresses for tourists, vinyl gloves, dehumidifiers, complimentary juice and ouzo, use of her landline for local calls, every single kitchen utensil that other airbnbs don't bother to put, and of course all the typical stuff like extra sheets, etc. I have to mention that her place was so clean that even under the kitchen sink was super organised, well stocked with cleaning items and it smelled good! Amazing. Communication was perfect obviously. When i didn't reply at first from a simple lack of checking my airbnb messages, she even found me on (Hidden by Airbnb) and made the effort to contact me through that app. Location perfect on a quiet side street next to the acropolis amphitheatre. Quiet is precious in koukaki Athens where a lot of Airbnb are located on the busy and very loud main streets where earplugs are a must. Very secure front door to her flat (not old and wooden which is great for insulation etc.) is another resssuring plus. Not neeeded here for sure! What else can I say but that her flat was perfect and provided a super comfortable home for almost one month! Thank you so much Militsa."
21948767,396826075373641400,2021-07-01,512672,Peter,"Militsa's place was perfect! Fantastic location in a nice neighborhood, super close to the Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, beautiful sunrise/sunset views from the Hill of the Muses and Areopagus Hill, and easy stroll to Plaka and the center of the city. Militsa is super nice, her communication was impeccable, and she was very kind letting us check in and out late. You'll also find an incredible amount of thoughtful touches throughout the apartment. You could literally roll up just with your clothes here and you'd have everything you need. The apartment was super clean, beautifully designed, and cozy. The photos are spot on. The apartment is on the ground floor of the building and built into the hill, which makes it wonderfully nice and cool in the Greek summer heat. Wifi, hot/cold water, shower, aircon, dehumidifiers, hob, and laundry machine - like everything else here - work great. We'd book to come back here in a heartbeat - and hope to do so soon!"
21948767,456920784139410316,2021-09-22,1220382,Raymond,"This place is a rare find!  Located a short 5-10 min walk from the acropolis and museum.  It was very clean, new and comfortable.   The host was extremely helpful and very accommodating!   You won't find many places this nice for the price and location."
21948767,459908370353059020,2021-09-26,9557286,Géraldine,We had a very good time at Militsa's appartment. It's literally 2min's walk to the Acropolis in a very quiet neighborhood. Militsa is very reactive and accommodating host. Would definitely recommend.
21948767,467845279567639486,2021-10-07,15764709,Mo,"Military was amazing,  she made sure everything was smooth. Her place is walking distance to Acropolis and in nice area. I would definitely stay there again"
21948767,475098925162688396,2021-10-17,365112196,Ali,"Militsa apt is perfectly located, 5 minutes walk to the Acropolis, yet in a quite neighborhood. There are two areas with great food, also within 5 minutes walk.  The apartment itself is very well appointed, with all the kitchen equipment you would need. The rooms are clean and the dehumidifiers work their magic.  Internet worked great, and Militisa had thoughtfully stocked the fridge with water, and some beer and wine.  Tea bags, Coffee, both instant and drip, was well stocked.  The apartment was very tastefully decorated, and felt very open. <br/><br/> It is 5 minutes walk to the FIX or Acropolis Metro stations, however we preferred to take cabs which are easy to call using the BEAT app, a must for any traveler to Athens. <br/><br/>The the best thing about the apartment is Militsa. She is super helpful, from meeting us at the apt for an early check-in, arranging a 6:00 am taxi, locating the gate our ferry departed from,  and just keeping in touch to make sure we were not running into any problems. She has detailed maps / binders of all the nearby attractions, restaurants etc, and helped us locate a close by lab for our mandatory covid PCR tests, calling them to insure we would get our results on time. She is certainly a superhost. <br/><br/>One thing to remember that this close to the Acropolis is very hilly, and a 5 minute walk usually involves climbing up some inclines. That said, there is some amazing food just 5 minutes from her place.  There are two areas,  either go straight down Drakou towards FIX metro station, with the Kalamaki Bar, Ambrosia, and Seawolf having great food. Or for more grab and go turn left onto Veikou for fantastic Falafal, Thai at Tuk Tuk Thai, or sandwiches at Guarantee sandwiches, continuing on will bring you to more bars as you get closer to Acropolis museum. On  Makirigiani, you have the expensive tourist traps, opposite to the museum.   In Plaka, Cave of Acropolis, had delicious Greek food, go for their 2 person platters. worth it."
21953979,217005017,2017-12-07,23417689,George,"The apartment has an amazing design, is very clean and has everything you would need for a stay in Athens. The location is perfect being only a short walk to Thiseio, Gazi, Acropolis, Monastiraki and all the other wonders of Athens are within walking distance. Amalia was always quick to reply and was incredibly helpful. She made our last day much easier by allowing us to leave our luggage in the apartment leaving us to enjoy the city! Overall - great value home away from home. Couldn't have wished for better! Highly recommended."
21953979,221642546,2017-12-27,23220475,Stavros,"Everything was great at this little flat in Petralona/Thisio neighborhood. The place was extra-clean, warm and convenient, the mattress super-comfortable and the caretakers very thoughtful and communicative. Something else that made our stay an extra bit more great was the flexibility that the owners gave us in check-in and check-out times to help us with our flights times. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a clean and quiet place in a clean and quiet neighborhood full of interesting possibilities for eating, drinking and beautiful walks around the city center."
21953979,225986641,2018-01-08,577610,Giannis,"One of my best choices to stay in Athens! Well appointed with all the facilities even for a long stay, I felt home away from home! From washing/drying machine to Nespresso coffee maker and Netflix I enjoyed every single minute. You will also love the tasteful decoration as well as the  location near the Keramikos metro station that links you directly to the airport (8 min on foot). You can also stroll to Thision or enjoy the nightlife in Gazi. Communication with Amalia was excellent and I also appreciated the cleanliness of the apartment! I will stay there again if it is available! Thank you for everything!"
21953979,253043633,2018-04-13,17519951,Celia,"He estado viviendo 3 meses en esta bonita casa. Tiene un baño precioso, el colchón de la cama es cómodo, el salón/cocina es muy espacioso y tiene 2 televisiones para disfrutar de Netflix (una en el dormitorio y otra más grande en el salón). El sofá cama también es cómodo. Toda la decoración está muy bien cuidada y tienes utensilios de cocina suficientes para cocinar y disfrutar de tu estancia.<br/>Lo que menos me gustó fue el tendedero, que da a un patio interior y si llueve se moja la ropa. Y las vistas del balcón del salón son a la calle casi en la acera, en una planta primera (entreplanta).<br/>Amalia está siempre ahí para ayudar, contesta muy rápido a los mensajes y es muy maja!<br/>La zona es residencial y familiar, pero en 15 minutos andando puedes llegar a la zona de puestos de artesanía del centro y en unos 25 minutos andando a Monasteraki (unos 15 minutos en taxi cuestan unos 5€). Los metros más cercanos son Petralona o Kerameikos (barrio de Gazi) o Thisseio. Petralona tiene un montón de buenos restaurantes, panaderías, peluquerías, farmacias, pequeños supermercados... Todo lo que necesitas lo tienes a un paso en los comercios de barrio. Pero para ir al supermercado grande tendrás que andar como 5 minutos y cruzar las vías del metro por un puente.<br/>Puedes disfrutar un montón de Atenas en esta casa. Yo volvería sin duda a este apartamento tan renovado!!<br/>—————-<br/>I was living in this beautiful house for 3 months. It has a lovely bathroom, the mattress is comfortable, the kitchen/living room has a lot of space and the house has 2 televisions to enjoy Netflix (the bigger in the living room and the other in the bedroom). The sofa/bed is comfortable too. All the decoration is nice and detailed and you will have full equipment of kitchen stuff to cook.<br/>The thing that I didnt like a lot was the place to dry the laundry, it is outside and the clothes could wet with rainning or fall in a backyard. And the views of the house are to the street, near the walkside of the street.<br/>The host, Amalia, is always available to help, she answer the messages soon and she is very nice!<br/>The location is familiar and residential, in 15 min walking you could be in the center (where there are craft shops) and in 25 min walking you can get Monastiraki (the taxis are cheap, 15 min by taxi is around 5€). The metro stations nearest are Petralona, Kerameikos and Thisseio. The neighbourhood Gazi is very close too (Kerameikos station). The Petralona neighbourhood has a lot of restaurants, bakeries, pharmacies, haridressers, small supermarkets... all that you could need. The big supermarket is in the other side of the metro rails and you need to walk around 5 minutes and cross a small bridge. You will enjoy a lot your stance in this apartment. I would definitely go back to this renovated house!"

21953979,258394724,2018-04-29,67601819,Tatiana,"Amalia is great host and apartment is very clean, stylish and looks exactly like on photos. Acropolis and lots of other sites are very close (be prepared to make few steps up on the hill). Everything we needed we found easily. Thanks again!"
21953979,260804980,2018-05-05,45714504,Wendy,"Great location, quiet but within 10 minutes one way you are in central Athens, and 10 minutes the other direction fantastic restaurants and bars.  Well equipped with everything you need, and air con too (not that we needed it).  Highly recommendable"
21953979,262289066,2018-05-08,13823774,Ben,Clean and easy stay. Not a lot going on in the immediate neighborhood but close to everything. Apartment was clean and recently renovated. I would recommend!
21953979,263453782,2018-05-12,114180927,Eli,"Amalia’s place is the best Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. Her attention to detail, her thoughtfulness with her sweet welcoming treats, coffee, juices and water were a beautiful additional touch. She has thought if everything. Her directions for check in and how to find the apt were superb, and it was walking distance to all the major attractions. I would recommend her place to everybody!"
21953979,264012794,2018-05-13,57538143,C.,"I am very picky about accommodations when I travel, and Amalia’s apartment exceeded my expectations. We chose to stay there because of the great reviews, stylish decor, updated bathroom, and proximity to a metro stop and main attractions. What we didn’t expect but found upon our arrival was a plate full of baked goodies, orange juice and other things that made it possible to eat breakfast there before heading to the airport at dawn the next day. I really appreciated that touch. The apartment was very clean, which was important to us.  The photos and listing on AirBnB were 100% accurate. Amalia very quickly responded to several emails I sent after check-in regarding where to find sheets for the sofa. She’s a great hostess! One note to travelers: If you’re looking for an apartment with a terrace or a view, this one doesn’t have either one. It still is a fabulous place. I definitely would stay there again."
21953979,269262637,2018-05-27,2356196,Reena,"Clean, great location, stylish apartment! Everything you need for a great stay. Don’t think twice to book!"

21953979,277350061,2018-06-16,88645614,Harriet,"This is a lovely, clean and modern apartment. It is in a fantastic area, about 5 minutes walk from lots of restaurants and bars but it is quiet at night. It is close to a metro station which will take you all over Athens and is only a short walk away from some of the main sights such as the Acropolis. Amalia is very helpful and responded promptly to any queries and gave us advice about getting from the airport to Athens centre. The apartment is clean and the bathroom is modern with a large shower. The bed is large and comfortable and there is ample storage space, as well as air conditioning in the bed room and living space which was great. On arrival there was a cake waiting for us as well as water and orange juice in the fridge which was a really nice touch. Overall I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking to explore Athens and I would definitely stay there again, it was perfect. "

21953979,283495933,2018-06-30,79376455,Kristen,"We loved the apartment! Everything was clean and stylish with just enough space to spread out and be comfortable. Access to a Netflix account was also an added bonus. There was a bit of a walk to the Metro station (10 minutes). I would recommend arriving in a taxi because the streets are uneven with tiny sidewalks and makes it very difficult to roll suitcases. Otherwise, if you are just going out for the day the walk is fine. Amalia was a great host with quick and helpful communication. We would not hesitate to recommend this stay to others!"
21953979,284033768,2018-07-01,38336131,Miroslav,"The description is spot on, the location is easy to find, the host is super fast and very accurate in communication and the place is really nice!

The location was perfect, within 15-20 minutes walking distance from the Acropolis and surrounding neighborhoods, but in a much quieter part of town. The neighborhood felt very safe, which was important to me traveling alone. The apartment itself was very clean and well equipped if you need to cook, and there is a small grocery a few blocks away. Amalia was very responsive to my questions and requests."

All important spots are in walking distance- such as the acropolis and old town „Plaka“. You can reach the apartment by metro, it’s located only 700m from the next metro station. Contact with the owners was always very good. Many thanks, we had a great stay :) We recommend the Kerameikos quarter for restaurants, they are way cheaper then in the “touristic area“ and you find a lot of locals there"

Communication was great and Amalia was very accommodating with arranging late check out.<br/><br/>I stayed here with my partner and toddler for 7 nights - the provision of a spacious cot and high chair was really helpful to us. Check in was really easy. The apartment size is very generous with lots of storage space, and the bed was super comfy.

She even accommodated a couple of extra requests we had free of charge. The location is great, in a quiet neighbourhood but extremely close to Thiseio, Monastiraki and the Acropolis. We walked to the Thiseio pedestrian road every day in 10 minutes. We really enjoyed our stay at Amalia's flat and we would recommend it to anyone who wants to experience living in a central Athens neighbourhood like a local, rather than a tourist."

The whole place made us feel at ease! <br/>The apartment was walking distance from Acropolis and other touristic attractions, and close to metro to get you to the ones further away. It s very near Gazi, Psiri, Monastiraki, Plaka and Thision, places very popular for the lovely restaurants and bars. <br/>Amalia was very helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever we had any questions. <br/>Thanks Amalia and “Walk to Acropolis from minimalist Zen flat” for a wonderful week. <br/>We will be back, Titus."

It is in close enough walking distance to the Acropolis and main attractions, while still far enough to feel like it was a retreat from all the touristy spots. It was also very spacious, and it allowed us to easily cook a few meals when we didn’t feel like running back out for a meal after a long day of walking around. Having a supermarket a minute away also helped immensely, but they also sweetly had some treats for us upon arrival. And although we didn’t get to meet Amalia, her communication was super fast, and she even checked to make sure we got in okay. If we ever make it back to Athens in the future, we will stay at Amalia’s with no hesitation. Book this place!"

21953979,449972452,2019-05-08,31557753,Leilani,"Amalia is a great host! Very responsive and extremely accommodating! the place is very well kept, stylish and cozy.<br/><br/>loved the towel rack warmer! the decor was beautiful, very nice to leave us some marble cake and bread and coffee pods for breakfast! the bed was clean and very comfy! very clear and easy instructions to enter property. we would definitely stay here again!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!<br/><br/>*very minor things I could suggest are to offer more than 1 towel per person as well as maybe add a curtain or door to shower because it splashes a lot and clean the water dispenser of the espresso maker. maybe add usb cords to outlets or offer outlet adapters for foreigners."
21953979,451174896,2019-05-11,239221601,Varun,Nice and stylish place!
21953979,452865675,2019-05-14,235392231,Karin,"We very much enjoyed our stay in this beautiful apartment, that gave us an instant „at home“ feeling (pictures show exactly how it is). <br/>The apartment is a good starting point for exploring nice restaurants (e.g. Kuzina or Caravin) or the Acropolis in walking distance. „Dinner in the air“ and a Streetfood Festival were close by as well."
21953979,453249451,2019-05-15,42581237,Ash,Very beautiful and cozy place :) super clean
21953979,454356326,2019-05-18,97737600,Lorreta,"The place was very clean and bright with the shutters open.  The bathroom was very spacious. There were two TVs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom both with Netflix. Around the corner is a bakery which became our breakfast/snack stop. Amalia was very friendly and easy to communicate with when I needed help. Loved this home, wish we stayed in Athens a bit longer."
21953979,456687109,2019-05-22,83153144,Hector,"Although when you arrive at the front building you won’t see anything special, once you get into the apartment you’ll see a very modern and beautifully decorated place. In the kitchen there was a capsule espresso machine that we found very handy, especially for those that wanted a quick caffeine fix without much hassle. The Wi-Fi was reliable; good enough for us to communicate with our loved ones back home, among other things. On a very personal anecdote, we lost our baggage when we arrived at Athens, and had no other clothes with us at that point. However, the fact that the 2-in-1 washer and drying machine was inside the apartment (as opposed to it being just in the building) made our lives so much easier those couple days we were without our luggage. There were plenty of restaurants and markets nearby. Nothing fancy, but good enough to serve you with your basic needs and give you some local, non-touristy experience. We consider the apartment to be well located. It’s an approximately 20 minute walk from the Acropolis, so don’t expect it to be right there, but if you’re physically able to walk that kind of distance then you won’t have any issues. If you utilize the Beat app (like an Uber for taxis) you won’t have any issues finding the place if you need to get a taxi during the night or if you’re not into walking. Last but not least, the communication with Amalia was very satisfying. She was very helpful and was always available (through the Airbnb chat) if we needed anything. We really enjoyed our stay at Amalia’s place and would definitely stay there again if we ever return to Athens."
21953979,457935071,2019-05-25,44609815,Stacey,"It was very nice inside, but the location was not quite as central as we hoped. Some Taxi drivers had a difficult time finding it, and we didn’t feel safe walking at night as we were three girls alone. The inside was very clean and well appointed. The WiFi was pretty rough. Not much of a signal. We did enjoy the space a lot though!"
21953979,460804801,2019-05-30,200986656,Lin,Very nice! The host is super kind.
21953979,461852831,2019-06-01,229825289,Annika,"This adorable flat is homey, clean, and in a great location! The owners were easily accessible at all times and went above and beyond to provide us with the necessary information to make us feel at home."
21953979,464685279,2019-06-06,113122428,Megan,Amazing! So accommodating!
21953979,466272213,2019-06-09,63605343,Jean,"Even though we didn't meet the host in person, but check-in was smooth with clear instructions provided. Host also helped us arrange transport to airport and recommended a great place to buy nuts, upon request. We also appreciated the thoughtful gestures of providing bottled water, jam and bread. Apartment is spacious, stylish and pretty in pink, spacious for 2, with WiFi. About 10 minutes walk to the nearest train station, and only some steps (manageable) from main street to the unit."
21953979,467911802,2019-06-11,234221391,Matthew,"Amalia’s place was beautiful on the inside. Very cozy and welcoming with a booklet of everything you need to know right inside the front door. There were snacks and bottled water provided. The neighborhood is a little bit off the beaten path. There aren’t that many shopping or food options nearby, at least that we saw. We opted to get the extra exercise and walk to our destinations during the day and get a cab back at night."
21953979,468290729,2019-06-12,246103237,Nick,Super nice flat in typical urban athens. Easy walk to blue line. All amenities including washer/dryer. Sparkling clean.

21953979,473204883,2019-06-21,126704201,Arvind,"This apartment was amazing! Good location and very comfortable! All of the amenities were great. We did not spend that much time inside as we were out exploring but it was always nice to come back to a well furnished airbnb! On our last night we used the kitchen and found all the utensils, dishes, pots/pans that we needed. Highly recommend to anyone else staying here, this place is great."
21953979,473680823,2019-06-22,18303530,Caroline,"Ideal for a quick stop over in Athens, well located (20 minute walk from the Acropolis), central and some cute bars and cafes nearby.  Exactly as you see it in the pictures, spotlessly clean and nice design features.  The air con is probably a bit too noisy to have on for any great length of time but a welcome feature nevertheless when very hot outside (as it was during our stay). Amalia made sure our check in went smoothly (albeit from afar!) - would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!"
21953979,474330627,2019-06-23,71123048,Marilyn,This Airbnb is absolutely adorable! We were able to walk to the acropolis and restaurants  near by.  Definitely would recommend this spot.
21953979,475965905,2019-06-25,6320426,Neesha,"This place was the perfect home away from home for the last few days of our trip. Everything was clean and tidy, and the place was very spacious. Air conditioning was wonderful! We appreciated the easy check-in and check-out process."
21953979,480605565,2019-07-03,53644616,Janice,"Amalia is a great host who is easy to get in contact with and very communicative.<br/>The apartment was clean, modern and functional.<br/>The bathroom was spacious and beautiful and when you did not want to watch greek news and shows, Netflix was available.<br/>Close to downtown Athens, easy to walk everywhere."
21953979,483949920,2019-07-08,25357296,Annie,"Amalia’s place was everything we could have asked for and more! We were able to walk to many spots (restaurants, bars, markets) including acropolis! It is sparkling clean, comfortable and we felt safe the entire stay."

21953979,486707684,2019-07-13,241738129,Emily,I stayed here for the first few nights in Athens before heading off island hopping. The apartment is very secure and makes you feel safe in the middle of Athens (great location). Very nice decor theme and the place was spotless. Very comfy furniture and modern TVs. A supermarket is on the same road making it really convenient. Would definitely return if I ever came back to Athens.

The location was within walking distance to attractions, the apartment super clean & comfortable, and you can immediately tell a lot of care and thought is taken into designing the apartment. Thank you Amelia for the wonderful stay, I hope I have the opportunity to return & stay again!"
21953979,513844251,2019-08-20,38663056,Milena,"Such a wonderful apartment to stay in! We really enjoyed our visit to Athens, especially this apartment. It had everything we needed (wifi, washer, dishes, Netflix etc.) to fully wind down after a busy few weeks on the islands. The host was super thoughtful and made sure there was everything in the apartment we could possibly need (detergent, toiletries, clean towels, linens). The place was spotlessly clean and also a close walk to all the sights you’d want to see in Athens city centre. Highly recommend!"

It was spotless clean, decorated so cute, and stocked with everything we could have possibly needed.<br/>She even left treats out for when we arrived, it was so thoughtful! <br/>Check-in was super easy and the apartment is just a few minute walk from a nice supermarket. <br/>It’s not very often that you can walk into someone else’s home and automatically feel comfortable but this is how we felt staying there! <br/>Thanks so much for a great end to our vacation Amalia!"

21953979,526650860,2019-09-09,120064399,Rachel,Wonderful apartment. Lovely host- so helpful and communicative! Only<br/>con was location- far walk from public transport and not as close to acropolis as we expected. The comfort of the apartment was lovely though and host was helpful with setting up transportation :)
21953979,527120577,2019-09-10,133791221,Paloma,"We are so so happy that we stayed in Amalia's beautiful little apartment right in the heart of Athens! The apartment was so easy to find, and just a 15 minute walk to Acropolis and tons of restaurants. Right on the corner, a little convenience store we you can grab a local Greek candy or one of the delicious local Greek beers! We felt like we lived in Athens for the day! We stepped out of our apartment and explored. The neighborhood was bustling and felt very safe too. The apartment was  so so cute!!! She even left us these delicious sweet breads for breakfast. It was so thoughtful! The apartment was stylish, comfortable and had everything we needed. The bed was so comfortable, two air conditioners and two tvs - we felt so cozy the whole time. I definitely recommend this apartment for its style, cleanliness, size and location! Thank you Amalia for everything!"

21953979,532697089,2019-09-20,109057,Herb,"The apartment is in a residential area of other apartments. Very quite and walkable neighborhood.<br/>A small grocery on the corner, a very good bakery and an excellent pizza parlor that has takeaway only.<br/>We were here for only two days so we were getting to know the area it was time to leave.<br/>The apartment is very well sit  up for longer stays and we would not hesitate staying here again.<br/>Amalia was available at all times to answer my questions and arranged a cab for our departure."
21953979,533840999,2019-09-22,24980906,Laura,"Amalia’s place was immaculately clean and stylish. They were a lot of nice touches that made the stay extra comfortable. Her flat is very close walking distance to the Acropolis and easy to access from the Athens airport. We weren’t sure how 4 people could sleep there comfortably as there was only one bed, but it was fine for my friend and I. Overall would highly recommend for a stay in Athens!"
21953979,535326462,2019-09-24,129059706,Deepika,"Amalia's home is beautiful, warm, inviting, cosy, spotless and just what one needs to spend some time in this beautiful city. It is very close to Plaka and the Acropolis. It is within walking distance of Cafés and a supermarket. My sisters and I had a wonderful time here. Amalia's warm touch was so thoughtful with cakes and juice and water that she provided of her own accord. Thank you, Amalia, for your warm hospitality, responses to my endless queries and your beautiful home."

21953979,543623926,2019-10-08,20841617,Amanda,"Absolutely fantastic apartment! <br/>Everything about Amalia’s place worked well. It was immaculately clean, well designed, comfortable, well located and a great price. <br/>We travelled with our two teenage sons who shared the sofa bed quite comfortably. The bedding was cotton and tasteful colours used. The washing machine was a bonus having spent time away before arriving in Athens. The outlook from the bedroom onto the leafy back area of other apartments was pleasant too. <br/>We shopped at the very local OK store - it was OK! We used the barbers for €8 that gave a super cut, but a long wait despite no other customers... we went to Cine Paris and enjoyed a late summer evening (outdoor cinema looking sideways to Acropolis). We loved walking around the Acropolis ( go early - less than 20 mins walk away), and Agora with free Rick Steen podcast commentaries. We visited the  Acropolis Museum the day we arrived and felt oriented towards understanding something of the history of early Athens before we visited the Acropolis. We had the worst tea and coffee there of perhaps any trip anywhere...nice waiter though! Lovely food anywhere it seems. Super cheap and tasty Souvlaki from a very local place en route to M3 station. Trendy coffee at Underdog - coffee making raised to an art- sloooow food service though for one portion of pancakes. Great Greek dinner at number 51 on Trip Advisor - on walk to Acropolis from the flat."
21953979,547836681,2019-10-16,270033863,Rebecca,"My stay at the zen apartment with my daughter and dad was perfect! The sofa bed was very comfortable for my dad and so was the king size bed for us!<br/>The host really spent a lot of their time, energy, and funds to think about the modern design of the small apartment. The ceiling rain shower was wonderful as was the built in tiled shelf.<br/><br/>The angle wall for the tv was a very nice design detail and all points were thought out with quality and care."
21953979,551459698,2019-10-20,59990365,Kara,Really lovely apartment! The space was super clean and Amalia even left croissants for us to eat. The decorations were beautiful and the bed was super comfortable (we fell asleep immediately). The check in process was super easy with the instructions provided. She even has a book of local places which was really neat. Would definitely return if we ever make it back to Greece!
21953979,556377753,2019-10-29,161699600,Nur,"Amelia’s place is very clean, cozy and super chic! The minimalist deco is what attracts me and having the washer-dryer is a plus! There is a convenient store just 5mins walk and the area is peaceful and quiet too. We love it!"

21953979,588781067,2020-01-05,217648289,Christos,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Amalia's apartment.<br/>It is located in a great part of Athens close to the Acropolis and its nearby museum.<br/>The accommodation was extremely clean and tidy and we appreciated the host's efforts to make us feel welcome.<br/>Highly recommended.
21953979,600597218,2020-02-02,19400209,Valerie,"Overall great experience. Beautiful, simple decor, comfortable bed, great rain shower. A small grocery store and a bakery are located just around the corner! I liked the location a lot since it was not in the touristic area, rather calm but accessible, and just 1-2 stops to the city centre by metro. Also good starting point if you want to go for a jog :)"

L'appartamento di Amalia è molto accogliente e ben arredato, è dotato di tutto il necessario anche per soggiorno più lunghi. La posizione è strategica poiché è vicino alla metropolitana e facilmente raggiungibile dall'aeroporto, ma anche vicino al centro di Atene e all'Acropoli (raggiungibili anche a piedi). Lo consigliamo vivamente"

21953979,660975830,2020-09-06,3512924,Ioanna,"Amalia's place has an amazing bathroom and is located in a great neighborhood. The apartment is on the ground floor and does not have natural light , the lighting in the house does not compensate for that. We are giving it two stars due to a conflict with the host and because it's clear she does not maintain the apartment with care. We could tell that the a/c units were not working properly right away so we asked her to address the issue; this resulted in us having to act as the property manager and call the technician, schedule an appointment, and be present while the work was being done (our choice as our stuff was in the house and the cleaning did end up spreading dust on sheets and cleaning liquid on the couch which we wouldn’t have seen having not been there) . The technicians said the units had not been cleaned over 3 years. After the work was complete the house also needed a re-cleaning so we had to coordinate that with the cleaner too. Our conflict basically came from us believing that we should have been compensated more for our time and labor vs her saying ""you can have 1 day back or leave"". She said this after we had coordinated the cleaning of her a/c which she hadn't thought to do. We decided to stay and not take any money.<br/>When we discovered that her fans had a thick layer of dust on them (like they hadn't been cleaned in years) we didn't bother telling her because we did not feel we had the energy for one more round of all of this.<br/><br/>Realistically, both of these issues should be fixed at this point. You should just be aware that if you do end up in some sort of disagreement with Amalia, she may very well not be understanding.<br/><br/> Overall the bathroom is a treasure, but alone it's not worth the price of this Airbnb because the rest of the apartment is not thoughtfully put together.<br/><br/>As a final statement, the host did send us 1 day's money back but we did not ask for it and don't know where it came from after we had not spoken with her for the the rest of that week of our stay."
21953979,666997396,2020-09-22,3047756,Carolina,"This apartment is your home away from home while in Athens. It’s super cozy and comfortable. The kitchen had enough items for a long stay and there is a very positive vibe in every corner with the homely touches the host has given to the apartment. The neighborhood is amazing! Huge park with the best acropolis and city views only 5 minutes away walking. Plenty of supermarkets, restaurants (make sure you visit Blue Bamboo), coffee places and only 20 minute walk to Acropolis (which is very enjoyable and feels very short). I stayed almost two weeks in this place and I can easily stay for a year! Amalia was very responsive also and always had an answer for all of our needs. Definitely a place to stay if you travel to Athens!"
21953979,667212568,2020-09-23,13949283,Marie-Christine,The apartement  is nice located near the acropolis. there is no balcony but the apartement has everything you need for a city trip

The bed is comfortable, the AC and ceiling fans work perfectly! The bathroom is spacious, well designed and makes you feel like you are in a spa.  Plenty of fresh towels. Communication was excellent. Easy check-in and check-out. They would get 12 points in a Eurovision contest from me! :)"

The location is a nice walk to many main attractions of Athens. Our family of 3 slept very well on the comfortable bed and sofa bed, and the window shades in the living room and bedroom create a complete blackout. Excellent water pressure (and hot water) in the shower, too. It’s like a high-end boutique hotel suite that also has a kitchen and clothes washer. Highly recommended!"

21961391,240113245,2018-03-04,51502135,Laura,"Lykofronas was really kind and always ready to help us with any questions that we had. The apartment is good located since you have near a lot of options to eat and to buy and because it is not in a tourist area you are gonna find always really good prices. The apartment was very clean, just the toilet is a little bit small and you have to pay attention to the instructions of Lykofronas for the hot water, because it is a little bit tricky. But we got it! <br/>You a have a metro station just 300 meters from the apartment and if you want to go to the downtown, it takes just from 15 to 20 minutes. We walked once to the downtown but it was quiet far away and took us more than one hour, so I wouldn't recommend it if you want to walk the whole day! <br/>I recommend the apartment and Lykofronas for being a really nice person and I think the relation price - quality is very good."

21981519,253673737,2018-04-15,13947429,Wenkai John,"Anna’s location is very near the Monastiraki Metro station! When u exit the station don’t go towards the square’s exit but to the other exit which will lead you right opposite the road which leads to the apartment. there was a nice pantry there shared with other private rooms. We didn’t see or meet any other guest though. You have to climb 3 floors to the apartment. Room is accurate as the photos. Wifi works well. It is also very near the archaeological sites like Roman Agora or Hadrian’s Library where you can buy combo tickets easily, instead of going all the way to Acropolis.<br/>Thanks Anna!"
21981519,260205963,2018-05-04,58835983,Ville,Great apartment in an excellent location. The host is really helpful and made the trip even better!

Room was exactly as depicted in the photos. <br/>Felt safe too as there was digital lock for the building door, followed by the ""apartment"" door and then the room door.<br/>Host usually replies quickly to messages too."

There's really nothing fancy here, just a room and a shared kitchen, but everything was perfectly clean, safe and nice. The host was very responsive. Great value for money!"

A few small things could be changed to make the stay more pleasurable, but really you‘re probably not there for the room ;-)<br/>Avoid breakfast across the street. Coffee is okay though. "

Gros plus : la clim !!<br/>L'immeuble à une situation expectionnelle pour visiter Athene : on peut tout faire à pied ! C'est à 5 Minutes du Parthenon et du quartier Plaka. <br/>Par contre, l'entrée dans l'immeuble est vraiment déplorable ... et vraiment pas propre. On se demande où on va arriver ! Mais il ne faut pas s'arrêter à cela car l'appartement permet de passer un bon séjour à moindre prix.<br/>Merci !"

21981519,317327020,2018-09-02,131868955,Pierre,Anna is a very nice and caring person! She was very reactive when I had questions. <br/>The room is clean and perfectly located -in the heart of Monastiraki. You can do everything by walking and enjoy the vibrating nightlife of Athens! <br/>Just do not take attention to the street/building which are under construction. <br/>I definitively recommend this place !

21981519,368089529,2019-01-06,13703546,Emanuel,"Location is really nice. Kind of a strange street, but in the middle of it all. 30 Euros is too much for a single room this size, you can get whole beautiful appartements for that money in Athens if you book in time. Beautiful very clean bathroom, clean but not very clean room. Really dirty entrance&stairwell to the appartement. Don't count the shared kitchen, it's clean but strange and has 5 rooms going to it, no windows so stale air. Nobody ever used the kitchen during my 5 nights stay. <br/>Can be a little noisy at night, never really gets dark because of thin curtains. I didn't sleep well."

21981519,424819159,2019-03-17,68088634,Kostas,"Πρώτον, το δωμάτιο ήταν πάρα πολύ καθαρό. Έμοιαζε να είναι καινούριο. Δεν είχε ίχνος σκόνης πουθενά και το μπάνιο πραγματικά ήταν πεντακάθαρο. Δεύτερον, η τοποθεσία είναι πολύ πολύ βολική για όσους θέλουν να κινούνται μοναστηράκι-θησείο-σύνταγμα-πλάκα. Απόσταση 5 λεπτών με τα πόδια από το σταθμό του μετρό στο Μοναστηράκι. Αυτά τα δύο και μόνο το κάνουν μια πολύ καλή επιλογή. <br/><br/>Το δωμάτιο βρίσκεται στον 2ο όροφο (στην πραγματικότητα 3ος γιατί υπάρχει και ημιόροφος) και παρότι σε κεντρικό σημείο δεν είχα κάποιο ιδιαίτερο πρόβλημα με τη φασαρία. <br/><br/>Η τιμή θα μπορούσε να είναι λίγο πιο ανταγωνιστική σε σχέση πάντα με ό,τι προσφέρεται από αντίστοιχα καταλλύματα στην περιοχή. Για αυτά που προσφέρει το διαμέρισμα είναι λίγο τσιμπημένη. <br/><br/>Στο δωμάτιο υπάρχει κλιματισμός, οπότε για το καλοκαίρι θα είναι μια χαρά. Για το χειμώνα όμως δεν ξέρω. Επισκέφθηκα το δωμάτιο μέσα του Μάρτη, είχε κρύο αλλά όχι πολύ. Ο κλιματισμός δούλευε καλά μεν αλλά το βράδυ αισθάνθηκα να κρυώνω. Και δεν είναι και το πιο υγιεινό πράγμα να κοιμάσαι κάτω από το air condition.  Ένα σώμα λαδιού ή κάτι αντίστοιχο ηλεκτρικό πιστεύω θα ήταν προτιμότερο. Επίσης, μία έξτρα κουβέρτα για κάθε κρεβάτι θεωρώ πως είναι απαραίτητη.<br/><br/>Για ζεστό νερό υπάρχει θερμοσίφωνας απλά να ξέρετε ότι χρειάζεται 20 λεπτάκια περίπου για να ζεστάνει το νερό. Σταματάει αυτόματα. Πολύ βολικός.<br/><br/>Τα κρεβάτια είναι δύο μονά. Οριακά μικρά. Το ίδιο και το πάπλωμα. Για κάποιον μεγαλόσωμο 1.88 και πάνω ίσως είναι θεματάκι. Κατά τα άλλα αναπαυτικό αν και αρκετά μαλακό για μένα. Αλλά αυτό είναι και θέμα προσωπικής προτίμησης. <br/><br/>Για το βράδυ υπάρχει πολύ καλός φωτισμός περιμετρικά του ενός τοίχου καθώς και λάμπα στο ταβάνι, οπότε βλέπεις μια χαρά. Υπάρχει και ένα φωτιστικό δαπέδου που λειτουργεί ως φως ανάγνωσης αλλά μπορεί να το περιστρέψεις ώστε φωτίζει τον τοίχο και να υπάρχει ένα πιο ήπιο φως στο χώρο. <br/><br/>Οι κουρτίνες είναι αρκετά ελαφριές με αποτέλεσμα να περνάει αρκετό φως το πρωί και κάποιος που ξενύχτησε και θα ήθελε να κοιμηθεί παραπάνω μπορεί με το φως να ενοχληθεί. <br/><br/>Το κτίριο είναι αρκετά παλιό, όπως όλα στο κέντρο άλλωστε. Οπότε είναι και αρκετά βρώμικο.   Μη σας τρομάξει όμως αυτό γιατί ο χώρος του δωματίου είναι (Website hidden by Airbnb) ασανσέρ μάλλον δεν έχει συντηρηθεί ούτε πρέπει να ελέγχεται καθότι δεν υπήρχε σχετικό χαρτί συντήρησης και επιπλέον πολλές φορές το έβρισκες κολλημένο στο ισόγειο και να μην ανοίγει η πόρτα. Θα σύστηνα να μην το χρησιμοποιήσετε έως ότου υπάρξει διαβεβαίωση πως είναι ασφαλές. <br/><br/>Για όσους θα θέλανε να σιδερώσουν κάποιο ρούχο υπάρχει σίδερο αλλά όχι σιδερώστρα και να σιδερώνεις πουκάμισο γονατισμένος και σκυμμένος στο κρεβάτι δεν είναι και ό,τι καλύτερο. <br/><br/>Τον κοινόχρηστο χώρο της κουζίνας δεν τον χρησιμοποίησα οπότε δεν μπορώ να πω κάτι.<br/><br/>Κατά τα άλλα, όπως είπα και στην αρχή, η καθαριότητα και η τοποθεσία κάνουν το δωμάτιο μια ιδανική επιλογή."

The room is very well located to visit all main places by walk. A very animated quarter but in a little street not too noisy, ideal.  The room was perfectly clean and we have access to a simple kitchen including common fridge for few rooms. I was well appreciated the private showroom. For that price and that location, you cannot find better. Really perfect for people searching a simple room and clean. <br/><br/>Emmanuel"

Secondly the location was EXCELENT, 1min from Monastiraki, 5 min from Syntagma, 10-15 min (max) to all major cultural/archeological landmarks.  The check in/out was easy and fast. The room was extremly clean and funky. <br/>I highly recommend Yannis' place !"

Yannis is a very nice host and contact me before my arrival in order to give plenty of information regarding how to reach the place, transport among others. The place is located very near Monastiraki square. The room was very comfortable as it was described. Although the entrance to the building was not very nice, once you get inside the apartment it is all better. I will surely return to Yannis place if I go to Athens again."

From the moment we booked (for the next night), we received a warm welcome with very clear check in instructions - a very smooth and easy process! The location is amazing - cannot recommend higher enough within Athens - a safe and lively area with everything at your doorstep. We walked everywhere and Yannis gave some lovely recommendations in the local area which we AMAZING! After check out, we were able to leave our bags in a secure area while we continued exploring before flying out that evening. Great place, highly recommend! Thank you Yannis!"
21981519,528966031,2019-09-14,44200267,Karla,"This is a private room within an apartment-like little “hostel”. It has everything you need to have an amazing stay, you have access to a fully equipped kitchen and a private bathroom and shower. The location of the building is just fabulous and couldn’t be more convenient, really close to awesome neighborhoods and interesting places, you can go anywhere walking. I totally recommend the place and the hosts, they took care of us by sharing very useful tips and answering all our questions really fast!"

I really enjoyed my last night in Athens at this place and could not have asked for a better place to stay. Conveniently located near Monastiraki Square, the train station and all the action. If you were traveling solo or with a friend this is a perfect budget room. Most of your traveling will include exploring the city that you will not need a fancy kitchen or living room at some Airbnb units offer. This is perfect for ending a long day with a hot shower and sleeping so you can start the next day all over again exploring the city of Athens!"
21981519,542027768,2019-10-06,94649328,Ria,"Great room and location, easy to get to when you need a rest or a break from the madness of travelling in Athens. Bathroom has plenty of hot water and the shower has the attachment to stand under it (very rare in Greece). Space is cool, the cleaners come regularly and clean the communal space, kitchen has plenty of utensils snd amenities. As with any traveling, if you’re a light sleeper bring a mask and earplugs, but that’s common sense. Was worried as a solo female traveler but the entrance door is quick to open with a code and locks behind you, the appartment and room also locks, so I recommend!!"

It is located about 3-5 mn far away from the center which is considered as the best place to eat in the whole neighbourhood of Athens.<br/><br/>House itself is very clean and well organised. No issues. Neighbourhood is safe but noisy a bit because of the building constructions, which should be temporary I believe. <br/>The host is absolutely responsible and nice person who provides the useful information at his very earliest conveniences. <br/><br/>Have a great time in Athens!<br/>Best"

Yannis already switched on the heater so I was able to find a warm room. Also, they provided indications about where to eat and drink and what to do on new year's eve. The building is safe and in a very great location in the vibrant heart of Athens, near to restaurants, bars and to the Monastiraki metro station.

The loft was also located about a 30 minute walk from the center, but I enjoy walking and it led us through some other cute areas of Athens I would not of discovered on my own.

The apartment was clean and exactly like in photos! Fresh sheets and towels laid out on the bed when we arrived. The kitchen was good - big fridge and freezer, was great for storing all our food and lots of water. The AC was a life saver in the heat, and the balcony was a lovely little spot for a drink and to look out over the city. A lovely little neighbourhood! (Be warned, supermarkets we found there were quite overpriced - best to find a larger one/Lidl). Thank you Eleni for a great stay! "

21993344,336185259,2018-10-14,142665489,Paulina,"We had an amzing stay at Eleni’s apartment and recommend it to everyone. So much better then any touristic hotel, we felt the apartment has a lot of local charm and that is very precious to experience. One of the best things was opening the door to a large balcony/terrace in the early morning and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere and light breeze while having breakfast :-) The location is perfect, cosy neighborhood. Taking a walk over the green hill towards Acropolis was also a highlight. Thank you for really nice, relaxed and easygoing stay!"

Across the train line is a fabulous area for hidden garden restaurants.<br/>The winning feature of this apartment is the terrace area with great views, perfect for eating and relaxing outdoors. <br/>Kitchen has full stove and oven. <br/>The bed is a sofa bed and I found it sufficiently comfortable for a 2-week stay.<br/>Check in and out was easy, and there is a lift for easy access to the apartment."

Eleni was helpful, always answered my questions in minutes. The apartment itself feels a bit old, which is not a problem until it gets cold - during my stay it was pretty cold outside and it was impossible to heat up the rooms even though there is an AC to heat and an electric heater. It got worse when there was strong wind. Anyways, this shouldn't be a problem if the weather is a bit more friendly."

Do not switch on radiator and AC same time :D<br/>Little problem with cold water in washbasin (no cold water; if you turn it on, remember to turn it also off, coz water starts to run after loooong time), but you can do your things with tap from shower.<br/>I recommend this place - it is clean, not so far from public transport."

21994352,275877048,2018-06-12,101049173,Sylvie,"Emplacement idéal mais métro à environ 500 m. Monastiraki à 500 m à pied. Appartement clair et propre mais balcon petit. Très bon accueil par la propriétaire, tout pour le petit déjeuner plus attention particulière avec vin, bière. A recommander. Nous avons, malheureusement, eu un problème avec la climatisation d'une chambre qui ne fonctionnait pas, ce problème a durer l'ensemble de notre séjour. Dommage quand il fait plus de 30° degrés dehors car difficile de dormir."

21994352,289441723,2018-07-12,140071747,Amit,The place is amazing and more over kitty is a great host. We reached Athens and it was raining but kitty was all ready waiting to greet us with umbrellas. Her warm welcome and thoughtful preparedness won our hearts. She had already stuffed the moth hen with a few snacks and daily needs also she was more than generous to place a bottle of wine for us which we all enjoyed very much.<br/>If you ever visit Athens this is the place to stay.
21994352,305236678,2018-08-11,25951879,Christopher,"Very nice apartment, spacious, very clean, well equipped, and it looks like it was very recently renovated.<br/><br/>Kitty reserved great welcome for us with breakfast cereals for the children, milk, jam, and a bottle of wine for us. <br/><br/>The bathrooms were well equipped with shower and body gel. There were sufficient towels for everyone.<br/><br/>There are balconies to two different sides and we could breakfast outside in the morning when it was still relatively cool. <br/><br/>Having stayed here in August, the air conditioning was fully appreciated. <br/><br/>We were only 10 or 15 minutes from downtown Athens. Everything we visited could be visited on foot, but the metro station is only a few minutes walk away as well.<br/><br/>We highly recommend this apartment, well-suited for parents with children or two couples."

Even long before our arrival they were providing precious help and already welcomed us with a smile :)<br/>Their apartment is a wonderful place not far from the interesting spots, located in an authentic part of the city. <br/>It‘s truly the perfect place to discover the city by yourself, you can even walk to most of the sights from the apartment (but the metro is close too). And when you come back it‘s the perfect place to relax and have a great time there. It‘s very modern, clean and equipped with everything you need. It combines the comfort of a hotel with the charme and atmosphere of your own apartment, so all in all it could not have been better!

The area is quiet but very central, only a 10-15 min walk from the Acropolis and Plaka. The metro nearby is handy and taxis are plentiful and cheap. The area is more residential which was perfect to see a little bit of local life. The apartment was very modern, clean and comfortable. There is a/c for the hot summer days and balconies to enjoy. Both Maja and Hlias were always available if needed and we appreciated their local knowledge. Would highly recommend staying here!"

The location is perfect, right next to the metro, probably a 5 minute walk max. It felt really safe when we were there, we grabbed some Gyros nearby around 10PM with no concerns whatsoever. The place is ABSOLUTELY amazing, the pictures don’t do it any justice. It has all the amenities you need: high speed internet, cozy living room with TV, washer and dryer, clothes iron, and a fully equipped kitchen. We used the kitchen daily using ingredients we bought from a nearby market, and also used it brew our morning coffee.<br/><br/>Maja met us when we checked in and gave a well thought out tour of the place. She definitely went above and beyond, and this is reflected in every detail that went into her apartment. To sum it up Maja is the definition of a perfect host, and her apartment exceeded our expectations. We will absolutely book this apartment in the future whenever we return to Greece!"

The unit is just a walking distance (around (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) min) from the most iconic sites Athens can offer including historical sites such as Acropolis, shops such as Plaka and restaurants.<br/>Maya was a fantastic host, she gave us all the tips and information we needed for our holiday in Athens. Furthermore she was so kind to send a follow up email with the summary of all the important tips as there were too many of them to remember.<br/>I personally was amazed with the clearness of the place, the kids with the superfast Wi-Fi and Netflix of course , and my wife with the appliances and equipment. But all of us were absolutely charmed by Maya's kindness and hospitality, her beautiful smile and her willingness to help us feel like we were at home. <br/>We had an absolutely fantastic time in Athens.<br/>Maya, thank you s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) much for everything.

In der Küche ist alles wichtige vorhanden, sogar eine Geschirrspülmaschine. In die Plaka läuft man ca. 15 Minuten. Um die Ecke ist ein Pitaladen sowie ein Minimarkt. Mit der Beat-App konnten wir jederzeit ein Taxi zum günstigen Preis bestellen, das war ein sehr guter Tipp. (Nicht die Taxen von der Straße heranwinken, die sind defintiv immer teurer.) Hlias war super nett und die Kommunikation klappte einwandfrei. Danke dafür. Wir können das Appartement zu 100% weiterempfehlen."

21994965,489693718,2019-07-17,262919533,Rami,"The apartment is very clean and stylish. It is centrally located with only a 20 minute walk to Sites such as the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Olympic Stadium, the Acropolis Museum, and Plaka (all located in one vicinity). Furnishing is minimal, but enough for all your needs with a seating area for 8 and a dining table for 6 (plus three bar stools). It is located on the second floor (third floor by US counting) and no elevator, but stairway is well lit by a command button which lights the stairway for a couple of minutes to get you through. Window shutters can be used to block out light for sleeping in, and then be raised to let in the plentiful natural lighting through the large windows and balcony doors. The two restrooms are a great size and provide the added convenience of not having to wait for showering or using the bathroom. Nearby is a wonderful Taverna - Ta Philarakia which serves the juiciest chicken and pork dishes. A great coffee shop is located at the corner of Ipparchou and Amvrosiou Frantzi, followed by a quaint and delicious bakery also along Ipparchou. We also tried Chicken Fresh - also great rotisserie chicken and potatoes. Finally' there is a great local “farmers market” on Dionysiou street (5 minutes walk from the apartment) that we stumbled upon while walking to the Temple of Olympian Zeus. This was a great choice of an apartment for our family and we will definitely stay again!"

The apartment located very close to the central Athens, taxi takes 10 mins/4 Eur to reach the attractions. There are two local markets 2-3 minutes away, open till 11pm helped us to buy day to day things. The flat is good sized, very well  decorated as can be seen from the photos. There are nearly everything in the apartment that helps you to kickstart your accommodation. I strongly suggest hiring the place to anyone visiting Athens."

You are 10 mins walking from some of the best bars and shopping locally, and 15 mins walk from the Acropolis! The apartment itself had everything we needed - the washer and dryer worked great and the desk chair was such a bonus for us as digital nomads. :) Maja was pleasant to work with and very communicative and let us store our bags after checking out so we could plan logistics worry-free. Thank you for everything, Maja!"

Die Kommunikation hat super und schnell geklappt. Wir haben die Küche nie benutzt, da es in der Umgebung tolle griechische Restaurants gibt. Die Küche wäre aber top eingerichtet gewesen. Zu Fuss in die Innenstadt (Eingang Akropolis) war es ca. 20 Min.<br/>Wenn wir das nächste mal in Athen sind, werden wir wieder diese Wohnung buchen."

21995360,233848260,2018-02-11,168592102,Edoardo,"Un’accoglienza calorosa così è iniziato il nostro viaggio ad Atene. Nella casa ci hanno accolto due signore di cui una parla benissimo italiano,  ci hanno mostrato la casa così come si fa con gli amici. La cucina è fornita di tutto. Il wi fi funziona benissimo e cè la tv.   Hanno avuto tante piccole attenzioni, biscotti, cioccolatini e generi di prima necessità. E’ situata vicino al centro di Atene ma se un giorno si vuole mangiare vicino casa ci sono molti locali  dove mangiare bene. Particolare importante sia il check-in sia il check-out sono elastici.  Insomma andando via avevamo la sensazione di aver lasciato degli amici e non un appartamento qualsiasi. Lo raccomandiamo caldamente."
21995360,240536048,2018-03-05,22513434,Lucie,"Náš pobyt v Athénách byl úžasný i díky skvělé pohostinnosti, byt byl krásně čistý, prostorný a vybavený všemi možnými drobnosti (plně vybavená kuchyň i koupelna), a myšleno zde bylo i pro zapomnětlivé cestovatele (pokud byste zapomněli šampon nebo zubní kartáček). Fulya reagovala hbitě na všechny možné dotazy i ohledně tipů na výlety po městě i do okolí. <br/>Toto ubytování vřele doporučuji, vše odpovídá zveřejněným fotografiím, při další návštěvě Athén budu ráda opět bydlet zde."

They’ve checked with us all the time and printed our plane tickets when we left Athens. They were very nice and kind. <br/>The apartment is very big, quiet, modern and extremely clean and comfortable, you will find all that you need there; coffee and tea are for free; the location is very good, 15 min by feet from Acropolis; you can eat good and cheap food in the neighborhood.<br/>We had a great stay in Athens and I highly recommend staying in Fulya’s apartment, it’s perfect if you want a home away from home!"
21995360,249859108,2018-04-03,14560586,Jelka,Fulya’s place was the right choice to explore Athens. It is within walking distance to all atractions and the center of Athens. The flat is very nice refurbished and very clean. It was very easy to comunicate with Fulya. I highly recommend this place. Would love to come back again.

And last but not least they let us stay in really late so we didn't need to worry about our late flight home. All in all Athens is a great city worth at least a week of everyone's time."
21995360,272191648,2018-06-03,52973653,Suzanne,"This flat is beautiful and fully updated. It is in a relatively quiet residential area with bakery,  coffee shop and markets for food very nearby. We got fantastic fresh bread from the bakery every morning. The kitchen was well stocked with essentials for cooking. Everything needed for cleaning up was stocked. It was very easy to live in this flat. Great local information was provided  by the host.  Getting to the acropolis and central plaka was an easy 15 minute walk. It was easy to catch a cab if you want to go further away and the cab fares were reasonable when they picked you up near the apartment.  Be warned, if you try to catch a cab from the tourist areas, such as outside  the Archeological Museum, the prices are double. We did not try to take the metro, but it is conveniently located to the flat."

21995360,318624788,2018-09-04,34219233,Buvini,"This is a large, stylish apartment in a good location. Fulya was quick and responsive. Our flight in to Athens was delayed so that we only arrived at the flat just before midnight. Fulya had no problems with that and was very accommodating. We were met there by her parents who gave us detailed instructions and were very helpful. Fulya also provided us with a couple of pages of tips for restaurants, etc. in the area, which was handy. Fulya was also gracious about pushing back the check out time a little bit to accommodate our later flight out of Athens. The flat itself is in great condition, has a couple of small but lovely balconies, is stylishly decorated and is very spacious. All in all, it was great value for money and I would certainly choose to stay there again."

The apartment had everything you need, both the kitchen and the bathroom were extremely well equipped. In addition, every detail in the apartment is wonderful and well thought of. The decoration is very stylish. The location is very central, it took us 10-15 min to the Acropolis by foot. There were some delicious bakeries, stores and restaurants around.<br/>This is definitely our place in Athens and we will go back for sure. <br/>Thank you, Fulya!"

21995360,410364518,2019-02-10,2158309,Lorenzo,The place was as we imagined. But there were a few extra touches that made a great stay. Dominicos (if I’m not misspelling his name) greeted us with a warm welcome that included Turkish delights and coffee straight from Istanbul. Furthermore the list of local spots that they shared was great. (Especially Lolos). <br/><br/>We came with our two(loud) kids but the only comment from the neighbor below was a big smile and a “I love the sound of small kids”. Perfect.

21995360,471757481,2019-06-18,51139831,Roberto,A good value apartment in a typical central Athenian neighborhood (10-15 min walk from the Acropolis). Great apartment for 4 people. In the neighborhood (Koukaki) there are a number of rather good bar & restaurants at relatively inexpensive prices. Excellent on-site assistance from Fulya's family. The apartment is 10 min walk from the subway and below the house there is a stop for a series of buses that take you to the Acropolis and to Syntagma square

(Draps pas tous super propres, mobilier abîmé et vieux, porte de salle de bain qui reste entrouverte et ne ferme pas, quelques cafards dans la salle de bain… rien de méchant quand on reste deux jours mais qui devraient être traités avec plus de sérieux quand on loue son appartement)."
21995408,456931547640783459,2021-09-22,85723078,Paulina,"Overall we had a very good stay at the penthouse. The area is very cool with many spots to eat and drink and have coffee, but also the more historical part of Athens is within walking distance. The apartment + terrace are both very big, so you can really have a good time there without having to leave the house - or if you need to get work done it’s very handy to have several rooms. The kitchen is very well equipped and I would definitely recommend to have dinner at the terrace and watch the sunset. We had an issue with the bathroom door which could not fully be closed, so the hosts should definitely get that fixed. Other than that, everything great! Communication was quick and easy."

22006696,299086336,2018-07-30,63055380,Alexander,"My girlfriend and I stayed here over a long weekend and had a wonderful time. The flat is very well presented and has a balcony with a view of the Hill of the Muses and a charming pedestrianised street. The location is ideal; it is a pleasant fifteen minute walk to the Acropolis and another ten to the Ancient Forum and Monastiraki. However, being on the far side of the Acropolis to the other sites means that the area is a bit less touristy and there are some excellent restaurants nearby (in particular a seafood place practically next door). The flat is thoughtfully laid out, decorated, and equipped and overall provides an excellent AirBnB experience. "

The sofa bed is large and comfortable, while the balcony also provides a great spot for breakfast etc. There is a well-equipped kitchen for preparing food as well. A main highlight for me was the neighbourhood - it's close to the Acropolis and historical centre, while also having a slightly calmer atmosphere - that said, there are countless restaurants, bars and coffee houses right outside the door.<br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Stefanie's apartment to anyone staying in Athens!"

Though I wasnt expecting a response before noon ( who would be up on a Sunday morning anyway...) there she was within half an hour of my booking request confirming everything and providing info on how to get there and how to check in! <br/>She was extremely welcoming and communicative all the way until i was having coffee on her cozy little balcony well settled in what is one of the best cared apartements I have come across in Greece. Stefania made absolutely sure I had everyting I needed for my stay and would constantly be a chat away on airbnb inbox for whatever question or querry I could come up with! I was lucky enough to meet her shortly on my second day as she popped by to bring me juice and some extra provisions for the flat! She was a stelar host and all her attention and character made my stay stay in Athens a trully memorable one! Highly recomended to anyone who wishes to have a totally care free stay!

22006696,444589331,2019-04-28,60259155,Fanny,L’appartement de Stefania est très bien placé : proche du métro et au pied de l’Acropole. La rue est vivante et il y a des commerces et restaurants donc c’est bien pratique. <br/>L’appartement en lui même est bien aménagé et agréable avec sa petite terrasse. <br/>Stephania est une hôte à l’écoute est très réactive

The location of the apartment is great, it is only a short walk from the major tourist destinations and very near public transport, it has lots of nice bars and restaurants right next to it and the apartment acts as the perfect place to enjoy the city of Athens."
22006696,456733511,2019-05-22,244927498,Yves,L’appartement est très bien situé dans une rue piétonne. Il faut s’attendre à une surface assez réduite et accepter de baisser ou lever le lit mural à chaque utilisation. <br/>L’appartement est tout près de l’Acropole et du métro qui va jusqu’à l’aéroport. Il faut compter une heure de trajet.
22006696,457883425,2019-05-25,58212211,Emily,"Highly recommend! Stefania is an amazing host, always quick to reply and gave detailed directions and great recommendations. The apartment is so close to everything and was the perfect spot. Would 100% stay again!!"

Stefania gave us excellent recommendations of food and places to visit around the area. The check-in process was exceptionally easy, even after our flight got delayed by 6 hours and didn’t land until 2:00am"
22006696,464636321,2019-06-06,65628230,Geneviève,La location de cet appartement est simplement parfaite ! À 10 minutes à pied du quartier Plaka et 10 minutes également de l'Acropole dans un quartier sécuritaire. Proche d'une station de métro. On est proche de tout mais sans les foules de touristes. Le check-in est très clair et Stefania est une hôte attentionné qui donne pleins de conseils pratiques et bonnes adresses dans le quartier. Propreté irréprochable lors de notre arrivée. Terrasse superbe située au 4e étage qui offre intimité et tranquillité.<br/>Cet appartement est parfait pour un couple ! J'y retournerai sans problème !

22006696,477907850,2019-06-29,256003502,Oonasofia,The apartment was everything we could ask for for a few nights stay in Athens. The location is amazing with subway right next to it and walking distance to Acropolis and the surrounding area of Parthenon. We loved the beautiful small balcony for enjoying slow breakfasts and drinks by night. Stefanie always answered fast and the check in was super easy and simple. Airconditioning and fan made the apartment pleasant even in the extreme 40 degrees. The bed was comfy and we had all the facilities we needed. We would definitely go back to stay at Stefanie's place and higly recommend it to anyone!
22006696,480640231,2019-07-03,13156581,Rockelle,"Right in the midst of all the places you will want to go in Athens. A 10-15 minute walk gets you to the Acropolis, Plaka, both central squares, etc, however, you also have a number of fantastic eating and shopping options all around you. Comfortable flat that is beautifully decorated and very centrally located."
22006696,481055791,2019-07-04,153138787,Louis,"Very nice area, perfect place to get some rest after a long walk in Athens."
22006696,483970393,2019-07-08,41482557,Sophie,Nice little apartment with lovely balcony and really close to the acropolis and old town with lots of nice bars and restaurants a short walk away. Check in and out was really easy. My only comment would be that this probably wouldn’t be suitable for three guests as there is just one pull out double bed so might be a bit cosy with three but otherwise a good find.
22006696,486688720,2019-07-13,60808519,Live,"Stefania's place was lovely! It was very central and in a beautiful area with everything you need (cafées, great restaurants, super marked etc.). Her place was only 10 minutes walking distance to Acropolis and the Plaka. Stefania was a great hostess - very helpful and kind! We would love to stay here again!"
22006696,488436112,2019-07-15,20175616,Jill,"We really enjoyed our stay and it was our first Airbnb experience. Everything was really clear and straightforward and the apartment was great!

22006696,498092964,2019-07-29,1015663,Kelly,"We stayed here for the first two nights of our Greece trip and were a little sad leaving, as it already began to feel like home. The location is beyond perfect. There are so many cafes, restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and markets right outside the front door and we were able to walk all over the city to everything we want to see from our home base. The interior was very clean and cute. I was a little nervous about sleeping on a Murphy bed, but it was extremely comfortable! We loved having an espresso on the balcony each morning and watch everyone walking around the streets at night. Stefania was an excellent host! She was very responsive and went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. We hope to be back and stay here again some day!!"
22006696,499350762,2019-07-31,137062326,Laetitia,"Bon séjour chez Stefania. L’appartement est idéalement situé, près de l’acropole. Epiceries et restaurants à proximité."

She described perfectly the arrival so we could enter the appartement in the best  conditions (very late at night).<br/>The appartment was super clean !<br/>The location is really 10 minutes top to the accropolis which is perfect when you don't have much time to visit.<br/>Stefania also helped us book transportation to Piraeus port really early in the morning which was a really good service (good and polite driver, not expensive)<br/>I recommand this Airbnb !!!<br/>Thank you Stefania !"
22006696,502883343,2019-08-05,58059159,Kai,"The flat was clean and well equipped. The bed was great, we really enjoyed it to be so high :-) There is a great view from the balkony to enjoy the breakfast.<br/>The flat is location very central, only maybe 10 min. to the Acropolis. The street is calm and very nice with all the trees and good restaurants.<br/>The check-in and check-out was very easy with the keybox.<br/>We can absolutly recommend Stefanies flat!"
22006696,504711107,2019-08-08,36368492,Sarah,"We enjoyed our stay at Stefania‘s place in the heart of Athens very much. The location was perfect as it was outside of the main tourist traps but within a five minute walk to the main attractions such as the Acropolis. We loved having breakfast at the local bar & walking everywhere we wanted to go. The place itself was located within an apartment building shared by local residents, so it felt like we got a genuine experience of living in Athens. Definitely stay here!"
22006696,506208357,2019-08-10,63929062,Antoine,"Logement confortable et fonctionnel, bien localisé à proximité de Plaka et de l’acropole, dans une rue piétonne remplie de restaurants qualitatifs."

The location is prime! Not super touristic area so you can have a stay like a local but only 12 min walk to main attractions. It is located on a pedrestian street with great restaurants. Kalamaki highly recommend!"
22006696,524473621,2019-09-06,171354963,John,"A gem of an apartment in a great location on a cute pedestrian street. The apartment is chic and well appointed with a very clever and easy to use Murphy bed that is both a comfortable sofa and a comfortable bed. The bathroom is very large and the kitchen is good sized as well with three options for making coffee (nevertheless, we went out to one of the nearby cafes or bakeries most mornings). We especially enjoyed sitting out on the charming terrace in the evening. Lots of cafes, bakeries, and shops are nearby. It's also very close to the metro and bus stops. It's an easy walk to the Acropolis, the Plakka, the National Gardens, and many other attractions, including the Monument of Philopappos, which is visible from the terrace (bonus: no crowds and an amazing view of the city). It's a wonderful place to stay."
22006696,527140330,2019-09-10,74265848,Mags,"This is a brilliantly located little flat, so close to cafes and the Acropolis. <br/>Flat was very quirky, small but fine for our overnight stay. Spotlessly clean. Would have been best if we’d read the instruction folder earlier as the water takes about 15 mins to heat up via switching on the mains fuse box so we  were unable to jump in the shower when we needed it.  Stefania provided so much info to support our stay locally, with excellent contacts for late transport needs and ferry tickets etc. Fab all round."
22006696,529653741,2019-09-15,67355850,Eza,"Stef’s place was great, very close to all the main attractions and check in was breezy through the instructions that she provided. The apartment is filled with thoughtful touches and is very quaint and cozy for 2. Along the streets of Drakou you can take a pick of the restaurants available to have brunch or dinner, complete with local and international options. Laundry, convenience stores, and pharmacy are all within walking distance. Stef was highly hospitable throughout my stay, thank you so much!"
22006696,531756092,2019-09-18,44766771,Dörte,"Wir hatten eine sehr schöne Zeit bei Stefania. Leider haben wir uns nicht persönlich getroffen, aber die Kommunikation war sehr angenehm. Das Apartment ist zentral gelegen und sehr gut mit der Metro zu erreichen. Es ist sehr sauber und schön eingerichtet. Es hat uns an nichts gefehlt. In der Straße befinden sich sehr schöne Restaurants und Bars. <br/>Wir kommen auf jeden Fall gerne wieder."
22006696,534741186,2019-09-23,42281480,Caitlin,Great value for money. Clean. Lots of cute bars and restaurants in the area. Walked to the Acropolis.

22006696,542281872,2019-10-06,30154182,Rikki,Area was very noisy and it was difficult to sleep. There was noise both from outside and hallway as doors are old and not at all sound proof. Would not recommended for light sleepers. Also note there is only one room that is both a living room and a bedroom. The wall bed is very high and is not recommended for anyone with mobility issues or older people. Room was not well cleaned. No amenities. Having stayed in other airbnbs in Athens this was the worst and it is over priced by far. Neibroughood is lovley however.
22006696,544813302,2019-10-11,136124821,Taylor,Great place to stay in Athens! Loved the location.Was a perfect starting point for seeing all the sites around the city. Inside was a great size and the bed was super comfy! Definitely would love to stay there again.

22006696,550628103,2019-10-19,10647988,Steven,We were on a cycling trip and needed help to store and transport our bikes. Stefania's helpfulness exceeded expectations. The studio itself was very nice and practically furnished. The location excellent. One remark: for three persons the studio is a bit small. For two persons it's perfect. Highly recommend!

22006696,563202604,2019-11-12,72845061,Shane,"A nice little apartment close to everything in Athens, offers lots of restaurants nearby and convenient stores. It is a smaller space that would suit people who intended to be out more and use the space as a place to rest."

22006696,568931237,2019-11-25,309266110,Κωνσταντίνος,A cute apartment in a perfect location and neighbourhood. Quite close to Acpropolis and to the city center in general. 1 minute away from metro station. Ideal for 2 people (for more than 2 it can be a bit small). Stefania was quite eager to help with everything we asked. Had a great time there and i surely recommend it!

22006696,612909994,2020-03-01,125045224,Lucy,"I stayed at Stefanie’s place for almost 2 months and had an absolutely fantastic stay! The apartment is located on a popular pedestrian street with lots of amazing shops and restaurants. The apartment is only 2 minutes from the metro and is walking distance to almost every main attraction in Athens. Stefanie has wonderful food and museum suggestions; I highly recommend checking out her “local guidebook”. Koukaki is such a fun, hip, and vibrant neighborhood—it’s the place to be in Athens!<br/>As a host, Stefanie was always extremely responsive and helpful. Even after running into a few issues, Stefanie was always understanding and available. The apartment itself is pretty small (would be tight with more than 2 people), but it is wonderful for a single traveller or couple. It has all of the amenities that you could need, and the balcony is perfect. The apartment was very tastefully decorated and was very clean. <br/><br/>Stefanie, thank you for a great stay! You have made my time in Athens a memorable one!"

22006696,453350027102910507,2021-09-17,44456846,Alina Lavinia,Thea studio is perfect located and Stefania was very kind and helpful. We enjoyed the coffee in the morning on the cute terrace. Everything is very close and also the places recommended by Stefania were very nice. <br/>Definitely we will come back!
22006696,456276695290168614,2021-09-21,152140546,Sylvain,"We had a very nice stay in Athens ! Stephania was really communicative and supportive, instructions to get in the housing were clear and hours were flexible.<br/>The flat is at a top location to visit Athens by walk and was very clean.<br/>Would definitively recommend!"
22006696,459868675074846474,2021-09-26,21111333,Amber,This was a nice place to stay in downtown Athens. Walkable to areas of interest and it had all the amenities we needed.
22006696,461269716065612938,2021-09-28,53922926,Encarni,"Stefania fue muy amable y permitió que dejáramos las maletas temprano. La ubicación y zona muy buena. La limpieza dejaba mucho que desear, dejamos las maletas antes de limpiar y la única diferencia fue que se llevaron la ropa sucia y dejaron limpia. La ducha estaba con pelos,  esponja, botes vacíos de champú, pasta de dientes en vaso sucio, etc..."
22006696,463454470396460241,2021-10-01,86168675,Sven,a comfortable and sweet flat in a great area for tourists. we enjoyed our trip to athens very much! <br/>strongly recommend!
22006696,464943457325825566,2021-10-03,5227257,Tamir,"Stefania's apartment is perfect. The location is fantastic and it was super clean. The self check in process was easy and efficient. The kitchen is really equipped with some decent amenities like an espresso machine, stove etc. The balcony is really cute and the sofa bed is comfortable! There was a short temporary issue with the water due to water company issues (not Stefania's fault) and she answered right away and tried to help! <br/><br/>The only slight issue were noises coming from the street - from the taverns nearby and construction in the building across the street. It woke us up a bit earlier than expected but it wasn't that bad so I guess it depends.<br/><br/>Highly recommend it! Will definitely come again if I can."
22006696,467165644388875861,2021-10-06,20945477,Lillian,I can’t quite see how the sleeping coach could be used when the bed is down.  Otherwise a great apartment and location.
22006696,470756612358725612,2021-10-11,20034507,Theodore,"Stefania’s place is an amazing value for what you get. It’s is an amazing location which somehow combines being quiet yet full of great restaurants and bars. You are close to everything. Either by short walks or with the use of public transportation. The Metro is safe and clean and will get you everywhere, especially with the multi day tourist card. Thanks Stefania."
22006696,474330219992298082,2021-10-16,37967041,Sidsel,"Great value for money! The place is small, but has everything you need. <br/>Fast internet, a cute balcony, espresso machine etc. <br/><br/>If you are prone to get cold at night it might not be optimal with only a very thin sheet for sleeping, however maybe that’s just for Scandi people being used to huge duvets. <br/><br/>The area is really nice and if you figure out where the good places are located you’re in for a treat. The place opposite the apartment, Riza Riza, is really nice and we went there a couple of times during our stay."
22013976,222924481,2017-12-31,4998450,Bram,"Mary and Theo were quick and clear to reply and greeted us with a warm welcome :) <br/>The room is clean, large and the bed very comfortable. It has a balkony and the building has a rooftop terras!<br/>The reason I put only 4 stars and not five is because we found the kitchen quite empty (no pepper, oil, thee etc).<br/>I highly recommend this place!"

Plus there's a stunning rooftop to sip a cup of tea or just to feel the sounds of Athens. In addition, the locatis perfect, and Mary and Theo explained in details how to get them, which options. Also there's a lot of space I. Genetal. Kitchen is fully equipped and we were enjoying to prepare Greek cuisine! Many thanks to the host."

22013976,327658915,2018-09-24,192539334,Denis,"Mary & Theo have a wonderful place that is clean with a spacious room, beautiful balcony, and is walking distance from the main tourist attractions in Athens. The location is close to streets that have drugs and prostitutes, but you will be perfectly fine if you stay on the main roads!!!!! (Stroutarni, 3rd September, 28th October, etc.) It was lovely to have dinner with Mary & Theo with a nighttime view of the Acropolis. There are FANTASTIC bakeries and food spots very close to their place, and they are on the way to the metro! I already miss them and their place, and want to go back!"
22013976,437054981,2019-04-14,1416809,Chris,"Hello Mary, thanks for everything. We liked your flat a lot and thanks for the good recommendations how to use the metro. The flat were clean and nice. The bed was very comfortable. We would book it one more time we are in Athens. 5 Stars for you."

The apartment is small but nice and everything is within walking distance. Loud surroundings, but very centrally located. Athens is definitely worth a trip and I will certainly come back again. Thanks."
22013976,467909373,2019-06-11,75715303,Mariangela,"Mary & Theo are super present and available, ready to help with any possible request, kind and fast to answer. The apartment is cute, clean, confortable and has everything you need! We stayed for 5 nights and everything was perfect. The only bad side is that the neighborhood is quite bad, a bit scary to walk alone at night, but if you stay on the main road or take a taxi (which are very cheap) you will be fine. Thank you again!"

22013976,498154381,2019-07-29,232401220,Visnja,"Mary and Theo were really wonderful hosts!! They met me and my friend personally at our arrival. Theo helped us with the parking spot and explained where we should park the car during our stay. Mary introduced us to everything regarding the apartment. They were always there, for everything we needed and answered quickly to all of my messages. The place was perfectly clean, with a terasse, and we had everything we needed during our stay. Furthermore, I made a mistake and confused the days when I should return the apartment. Mary and Theo were so very kind to let me stay one day more!! Truly wonderful hosts!! I would definitely come back to their place and I recommend them with all my heart! Thank you, Mary and Theo!"

Mary était là à notre arrivée, souriante et chaleureuse, elle nous à bien informé sur les points d’intérêts à visiter sur d’Athènes et ses environs. Theo est passé nous voir au cour de notre séjour pour voir si tout allé bien et si nous n'avions besoin de rien. Mary et theo sont disponible à tout moment et très rapide pour répondre à nos attente. l'appartement est propre et bien situé au centre ville. En revanche, la rue est bruyante(normal c'est le centre ville) et peut fréquentable le soir(il faut rester sur l'avenue principale et tout va bien). En résumé, nous sommes ravi de notre séjour et nous vous conseillons cet appartement. Merci encore à Mary et Theo."

You can ask them anytime.<br/>This place is very recommanded."
22013976,540342234,2019-10-03,12196523,Kyoko,"Mary & Theo’s room, kitchen and bathroom are very clean and big enough to relax after walking around the city. The building is located in a very convenient place for exploring the centre of Athens. In front of the building is a busy big street so there are always quite nosy but I could relax in the room when I closed the windows. A big supermarket is just 10m away. It was also very helpful.  I could get to all the iconic places such as Acropolis on foot.  Here is a good place to stay for sightseeing in Athens."
22013976,544081947,2019-10-09,19454299,Yoxanan,"Modest price for a nice, cosy and basic place. Very helpful hosts. Maybe the shower isn't for people taller than 185cm."

The location is ideal, and though it overlooks Kolonaki Square, it was silent at night for sleeping.  The view from the large balcony is spectacular.  Everything in the apartment is new and worked perfectly (air conditioning, washing machine, etc.); the bed was as good as any I've slept on; the bathrooms (1 full and 1 half) were immaculate... I could go on.  Communications were fast and fully responsive.  Christos's place is more expensive than other Airbnb's in Athens, but worth every cent.  I recommend it without hesitation and thank Christos for making our visit to Athens so fantastic."

The apartment itself was very functional and clean and you have everything you need including a washing machine, dishwasher, iron and board, etc. The apartment has two separate toilets (always good when you have a guest) and the air-conditioning was nice and cold (Athens gets hot!) and this made it perfect for this city apartment.

A great choice for anybody who wants to walk and experience the city. The apartment is cozy, sparkling clean, and it has everything you need. Central heating during the winter was a great plus! Stay here and you won't regret it! Thank you, Panos! "
22029941,740908664,2021-03-21,95562818,Georgia,"Starting from the start: Panos place is in a lovely neighborhood, on the slope of the gorgeous Lycabettus Hill, safe and super cute with a lot of nice cafes, bars, bistros and everything else one could wish for. A lot of high rank politicians live nearby, so the streets are patrolled, that should not alarm anyone, the officers mind their business, in fact it is just extra safety! <br/>Having said all that, if you are not with a car be prepared for some walking uphill, so, maybe it is not perfect for people with trouble on their knees, unless they use a car to move around the city. I personally loved that little hike and being already on the slope of Lycabettus, I would go all the way up the hill whenever I could, this is one of the loveliest things you can do in Athens, the walk is beautiful and view simply spectacular.<br/>The flat itself is very convenient and comfy, very practically arranged, exactly the way i would have done it myself. It has pretty much everything one could need and looks cute. I loved the sparkling bathroom that is in the bedroom! Mrs Elvira, the super sweet lady who gave me the keys and who keeps the flat clean, is doing an amazing work at it, the place is shining, it is the only place I have ever been to, where even the sugar jars were spotless :)<br/>For me personally the only problem was, that the beds mattresses, even though they were truly not bad, did not agree well with my back and injured shoulders, which was unfortunate, because I loved the place. Also, only during the coldest nights, sometimes a bit of smoke would get in the flat through the windows, I assumed some burner nearby was emitting it, but that was not a big problem, usually it would clear within 30-60 min.<br/>All in all it was a wonderful stay. Thank you Panos!"
22029941,441032770945994437,2021-08-31,111942912,Francisca,"Mr Panos apartment has an excellent location, central and in a very nice neighborhood. The flat has everything you need, it's full equipped for everyday life. I had a long stay there I'm looking forward to come back.<br/>We had excellent communication with the host, and with also the cleaning lady, they were helpful at all times."
22029941,454022956978364882,2021-09-18,58415580,Jake,I would definitely recommend Panos’ apartment. The apartment is in the perfect location between Exarchia & Kolonaki - the area feels very safe as there are lots of police around. The apartment itself has everything you will need and Panos is super helpful and responsive.

The place was beautifully setup and comfortable. Loved the sofa, that turned into bed.  Window had screens and shutters provided security.

Ci ha fatto trovare gli ovetti di cioccolato per i bambini e anche un bagnoschiuma delicato apposta per loro. Oltre a tutto l’occorrente per la colazione. Piccoli dettagli che però fanno la differenza e fanno sentire a casa.

22045201,349326394,2018-11-17,4633673,Panagiotis,"One of the best Airbnb stays we've had. The house was very welcoming as everything was newly renovated with very good taste. It made for a very comfortable stay for our family (we have a small infant). The metro was in easy and walkable reach (7minutes) and the center another 10 minutes away, whilst the neighborhood was calm and quiet. The open air fruit and veggie market on Thursdays with cheap and tasty products was an extra bonus."

Also, she left a map at the air b&b which was very detailed, we used it to navigate around and it was great! We saw so much in the 10 days we were there. Her air b&b also had extra special touches like tea, coffee and a bottle of wine. We felt as if we were home away from home. I especially loved the black out windows, they helped us sleep in  and adjust to the 8 hour time difference. I would definitely recommend her place!"

The three bedrooms each had air-conditioning which was great for a hot Athens July.    Nikos and Ada kindly provided everything we asked for, with Ada even being there for a late-night check-in... much better than having us hunt for some key hidden in a bush and then trying to figure out how everything worked in the apartment.  Not only did Ada let us into the apartment around midnight, she also patiently explained each aspect of the apartment and the neighboring area.  <br/><br/>The WiFi was easy to use and fast for all members of the family.<br/><br/>While it might be too large for just a couple who might want a smaller place for a lower price, it is outstanding for larger families or groups of friends.  We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and certainly stay here on our next visit to Athens.<br/><br/>Nikos and Ada, many thanks.... Mangla"

When we got there the host helped us with our luggage’s, then he showed us how to use the code for the door entries. Everything around the house was upscale. All the rooms had air conditioning which was perfect for the hot weather. The location of the house was close to the metro go take you to the downtown of Athens where there are a bunch of different restaurants and bars. Would definitely consider staying at this house again when I’m back in Athens! "
22047314,297674031,2018-07-28,191800031,Jeff,"Great location perfect for our short stay in Athens.   Smart TV for Netflix was good and very large living area which was great for a family.  The three bedrooms are above the main living area all with AC accessible via a tight spiral staircase which was difficult with large suitcases.  Smart tv in,living area and main bedroom.  Wifi good downstairs but sporadic in some bedrooms.  Grocery store short walk away.   Ideal for families but main bathroom had drainage and electrical issues which I am sure will get sorted as we only notified about this on departure.  Good washing dryer in laundry with separate shower.   "

We found everything we needed in the apartment (plenty of glassware, dinnerware, coffee makers including espresso machine, hairdryer, iron and iron board, amazing freezer and fridge space). The neighbourhod is peaceful but at the same time at a walking distance to syntagma and plaka. There is also a metro station 5 mins away which came in handy!

22047314,420270370,2019-03-06,6489367,Thao Minh,"We stayed at Nikos for 4 nights and had a wonderful time there. The apartment could easily fit 8 people.<br/><br/>Pros: <br/>The location is top! Really close to all tourist attractions, safe and can be reached by bus & metro or even on foot. There are also a lot of cafes and supermarket nearby. <br/>The apartment itself was very clean and looked just like the pictures shown, really chick and spacious. There was actually everything you need. The checkin and checkout was super easy. Anta & Niko actually even let us leave our luggages in the apartment past checkout so we could walk around a bit before having to head to the airport (Thank you again for that). They were really nice and always within reach because their laundry store was just downstairs. BTW we had a wash machine as well as a dryer machine which was super convenient. <br/><br/>Cons: <br/>It tends to be quite loud at night and in the morning. There was always people talking or some car alarms going off on the street. The neighbors or the building next to us started drilling at about 8/9 a.m. A vehicle with loudspeakers drove around in the morning, not sure if it tried to sell something or collect something but it was loud. <br/>The toaster didn’t work, a lot of things fell off even though we barely touch it ( e.g. dishwasher, bathtub, knobs of drawers etc.). The bathroom downstairs smelled bad even though we kept it really clean. The bathroom door downstairs was awful to open and close. <br/>The apartment had a boiler which had to be turn on 30 min before use. The water stayed warm for less then 2 hours. That was really problematic for the 7 girls of us. <br/><br/>Overall we’d really recommend this apartment!"

Three spacious, beautiful and comfortable bedrooms upstairs and spacious beautiful living area downstairs. Everything was very clean, lots of light, and  fresh air. Tastefully decorated and full of little details for your comfort. The host was very easy to communicate with, gave us contact info for airport transfer, received us in person at check in and gave great recommendations for restaurants.

No problems with anything: easy check in with very friendly host there to meet us: helped with our bags and answer all our questions while offering good  local places to eat and visit. The place was very comfortable with nice beds , bathrooms and the air conditioning and Internet worked perfectly and made us very comfortable. Huge windows throughout the apartment made the place feel open and lots of natural light. Good location close to important sites to see and beautiful beaches. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a quality Airbnb. We would love to come stay here again."

Very close to great bars and restaurants. It's a lonnng walk to the Acropolis and the main downtown area, however its was very easy to hail a cab if you don't feel like a 30 minute walk, (especially if it's hot. Definitely doable in cooler conditions). We would certainly stay here again."

The host is friendly and helpful and after a week in the islands it was nice to have the laundry facilities. Our group enjoyed going to the shops and getting breakfast items and snack items to keep at the apartment and the kitchen had an espresso machine and conventional coffee maker which made it easy to put together a nice morning meal.

A few things note:<br/>-check-in was almost seem-less, the lady running the apartment met us at the door to show how to enter the building (with a key) and then separately the apartment (with a keypad). Make sure you have an internet connection on your phone to have contact through the Airbnb app for this method of check-in (they didn’t leave the front door key somewhere for pick up, or give the keypad door code to the apartment before hand). <br/>-WiFi is speedy and works well throughout the apartment.<br/>-The main bedroom has a really nice office/desk space<br/>-the second bedroom has an awesome corner big window, very bright<br/>-third bedroom was nice, a little darker as there’s a big tree in front of the window.<br/>-the kitchen is modern/clean looking.<br/><br/>Overall great  stay- recommend."

Easy to walk towards the intersection of Drakou and Siggrou streets where there are plenty of restaurants and cafes. Walking around the Acropolis site, you can easily reach the Plaka town and walk along Adrianou street where there's plenty of everything for tourists and locals. Extremely convenient location to take hop-on hop-off tour buses as well. The cafe at the street corner, To Kafenedaki, has friendly people and is excellent for breakfast every day."

Не понравился только вид с балкона, вернее его отсутствие,на внутренний дворик, стены и окна дома с голубями, но сам балкончик чистый. Квартира Находится у Акрополя, рядом остановка с экскурсионными автобусами, все в шаговой доступности, район спокойный. На соседней улице есть рынок, где продают много разных фруктов, овощей ....

22056579,286326953,2018-07-06,1726856,Brent,"Anna Maria’s home is gorgeous, contemporary, and beautifully designed. We were instantly comfortable and she’s she has thought of everything. The apartment is perfectly located in Athens and on a lovely street. Her entry instructions were easy and straightforward, which we appreciated after a very long day of travel. She was also very helpful and communicative and arranged airport pickups and transfers when we arrived, when we then left Athens for Santorini, and on our return to the Athens airport and transfer to Piraeus to the Sarconic Gulf. Her thoughtfulness and promptness made our stay and multiple trips within Greece easy and without any complications. This took extra time on her part and we are so thankful for her kindness and hospitality. We highly recommend her home! "

There are a couple of restaurants, cafes and supermarkets. It is close to acropolis subway station. I feel safe here, and would stay in the area again.<br/><br/>The flat provides almost everything you need at home, all sorts of kitchen kits, bowls and dishes, sanitary napkins, towels, welcome pack of toast and coffee etc."

22056579,572206664,2019-12-02,307173108,Alexis,"Die Unterkunft ist modern und stilvoll eingerichtet. Allerdings sind die Räumlichkeiten etwas zu dunkel, da sich die Wohnung innerhalb eines Wohnblockes befindet und daher wenig Sonnenstrahlen durchdringen um den Wohnraum zu erhellen. <br/><br/>Im Großen und Ganzen war die Wohnung sauber. Einziger Makel war das Bad. Die Tür zum Bad konnte nicht abgeschlossen werden und es war aufgrund der Beschaffenheit der Tür sehr hellhörig. Das Klo wurde von innen und außen nicht optimal gesäubert. Daher mussten wir bei Ankunft selber nachhelfen. Türklinke und die Halterung in der Dusche für die Kosmetikartikel waren nicht fest angeschraubt. <br/><br/>Schlafkapazitäten wären zwar vorhanden, jedoch ist ein Aufenthalt über mehrere Tage mit mehr als zwei Personen nicht zu empfehlen. <br/><br/>Die Wohnung ist sehr schön gelegen. Sie befindet sich wenige Minuten von der Akropolis und dem Akropolis Museum entfernt. Die nächste Metro Station (Akropolis) ist in 5 Minuten zu Fuß zu erreichen, diese wurde jedoch nicht so oft genutzt aufgrund der nicht guten Anbindungen ins Zentrum (Monastiraki). Wir wählten daher lieber den Fußweg bis in die Stadt (Monastiraki bzw. Thyssio), welcher ungefähr 10-15 Minuten betrug. Ansonst hätten wir mit der Metro umsteigen müssen.  Zu Fuß war alles gut erreichbar.<br/><br/>Insgesamt ist die Unterkunft aufgrund der wundervollen Lage sehr zu empfehlen. Für zwei Personen ist sie ideal."
22056579,576738616,2019-12-14,51730901,Lamar,"Super cute place. Fantastic location, near restaurant, metro and walking distance from Acropolis. Very safe neighborhood.

22056579,591953041,2020-01-12,22527562,Michelle,"The most important for me is the location,and Anna Marias' apartment is located in a safe calm neighborhood just a few minutes walk from the Plaka & of course the magnificent Acropolis! In fact we walked everywhere and had a great time.<br/>It was very cold once the sun went down, we had an electric blanket which was great. And a nice cup of tea, but don't expect a big breakfast, only biscuits with butter & jam,very basic. A minute away is George's place where you can have a super meal,with omelette,fresh squeezed orange juice & the best pastries! ""To Kafenedaki"".<br/>Arriving & entering was easy and simple, also Anna Maria allowed us to have a late check out, very nice of her. Good communication with host.Enough clean towels & cups plates & glasses for a family.<br/>There is also a super cool balcony! No view but such a nice atmosphere, if we were coming in the summer-a nice spot to have a beer, or smoke, if you must.<br/>Very nice,calm decor, I think you get it looking at the pictures.<br/>In conclusion-great city break in Athens...we'll be back!"

Anna is very helpful without being intrusive and replies to questions immediately. I fully recommend this apartment for cleanliness, style and practicalities.

22056579,664577914,2020-09-15,81237986,Leighton,"We were disappointed. Our key broke after using it for the 2nd time and Anna Maria was very rude and unprofessional about it. She spoke rudely on the phone and made us pay for the locksmith and told us we had to wait 5 hours until we got a new key because she was out of <br/>town and couldn’t give us a spare key. <br/><br/>The key was very thin and she said over the phone that it had happened to other people, and that those people paid for the locksmith so it seems like it was a common problem. Not only this we also had some cockroaches around the place which really put us off our stay. We asked for compensation but she ignored this request. Very disappointed :("

22056579,668447732,2020-09-27,26845408,Stephanie,"Amazing, this is hands down in the perfect location and it has everything you need. Lovely shower head with good water pressure, balcony, central location, netflix on tv and modern space. No need to look further. After being spoiled by this location I doubt I will ever stay on the outskirts of any city again."

22056579,734005432,2021-02-24,8948298,Benjamin,"Very nice apartment. Good quality furnishing and very high ceilings. Great location, seconds away from the Acropolis and in a nice neighbourhood with a good-sized supermarket 3 mins away. The apartment has a slight lack of natural light due to adjacent buildings in close proximity to balcony/terrace/windows, but it still felt airy. However great ceiling lights so I could happily stay indoors working all day. Would stay again!"

I mean what about my milk and cheese?! <br/>I also told him I CAN NOT RECEIVE PHONE-CALLS INSIDE THE FLAT bad reception in there and I would like to alter my reservation and leave the next day, his wife said of course no problem but then he came back with an attitude !!!! <br/>I asked to leave within the hour so he had NO EXCUSE but to accept the alteration of my reservation! I would have paid for a night .. <br/>Two friends, Athenians tried to talked to him as well and he basically laughed on the phone to one of them rudely…what is the point keeping someone’s money hostage if what you offer is not good??? <br/>My friends told me about the area that it is not a good one and I should have asked them before booking<br/>Unfortunately I booked for 9 nights!!<br/>As I wasn’t able to work from there I booked another flat So I HAD TO PAY FOR TWO FLATS during my stay in Athens <br/>He could have easily accepted my alteration and let me move out …. <br/>AWFUL EXPERIENCE <br/> Book elsewhere, a good kind host can make all the difference.. he is not one of those so save yourself the hassl"

Excellent communication, warm welcome, very clean spaces, extra towels, comfortable beds, soft linen and so much more! All in all it is a very stylish and well equipped place. The wall to wall, top to bottom windows in the bedrooms were my absolute favourite feature and although the apartment is situated on a busy avenue and may get a little noisy, I would 100% recommend it. Great location, walking distance to the most important museums and archaeological sites as well as the must-see neighbourhoods in Athens. <br/>Thank you all for a great stay!

L'emplacement est vraiment idéal et permet de se rendre vers l'Acropole et le quartier Plaka en quelques minutes. Par contre, nous sommes arrivés un samedi, et les bars au-dessous ont mis de la musique jusqu'à 2h30-3h. Il était donc difficile de s'endormir. C'est le seul point négatif que je trouverais a l'appartement."

22074774,285597433,2018-07-04,13801355,Isabella,"We stayed two days in the apartment as the ending of our honeymoon. Let me list some Pro&Cons:<br/>Pro:<br/>- perfect location - all the sights and main areas are within walking distance and the neighborhood has a great infrastructure<br/>- the host was super friendly and uncomplicated with the check-in and communication<br/>- the apartment has a great style<br/>Con: <br/>- the apartment is situated next to a big road. One can hear the traffic noise - even in the night. Therefore, I would not recommend the apartment for noise sensitive people. We did not mind and could sleep anyways."

Perfect spot for restaurants and all the tourist things. We even walked to the Olympic Stadium even if it was about 15 minutes away. The amenities were awesome. We even had a welcome gift upon greeting and giving our keys! I like the convenience of the welcome pick ups service in regards to booking transfers and tours.

22074854,307831740,2018-08-15,139504508,Igor,"Hlektra's apartment is a spacious and very beautiful: a huge (I think 70+ sq meters) main room, marble floors, mirrors, beautiful furniture with many personal nice touches. All was sparking clean and prepared to meet guests. It was noticeably better than we expected. <br/><br/>We were greeted us at building's entrance and taken to the apartment by elevator, and explained all features and where everything is located and where to buy food late, and how to get to tourist attractions. Huge balcony gave the overlook of the northern part of Athens and had chairs and table (and some plants), so we enjoyed the night view of Athens with a glass of wine. All rooms had powerful air conditioners, so we could set comfortable temperature in the whole apartment.<br/><br/>The area where the apartment is located is safe: we walked many times at night and only met local and typically friendly residents. We were told that there are some unsafe areas if we go further in some directions, but you won't need to go there since it takes about 10 minutes on taxi to get to most of Athens attractions and costs about 5-6 euros which was cheaper for our family than take subway/metro, and much quicker: the taxi station is located next building, and you can always get a cab immediately.<br/><br/>One of apartment's key features was security system and reinforced entrance door with multipoint locks: you could put protective blinds on windows and set an alarm. We felt safer leaving our possessions at the apartment than taking them with us, which was a good surprise. <br/><br/>Hlektra was very quick and prompt with response on our questions and gave many suggestions and tried to anticipate all our needs. It was really a pleasure to communicate with her and we would highly recommend her place to anyone planning to stay in Athens.<br/><br/>Thank you very much Hlektra (and to your mother)!<br/>Igor and family"
22074854,309270543,2018-08-18,143567426,Gianluigi,Really beautiful and large house with astonishing view on Atene
22074854,318616212,2018-09-04,14760973,Sandra,"I initially booked a 10 days holiday with Elektra in a property in Nea Makri which looked ideally suited to our family's needs, but unfortunately the terrible fires  which have occured this July (2018) have made it impossible for us to go there. We booked alternative accommodation in a different part of Greece for a week and Elektra was very helpful and suggested we could spend a few days  in her  property in Athens. It was a very good decision, her place is really large, beautiful and stylish (marble floors, air conditioning in every room), the welcome has been very warm and helpful (lots of local tips and practical suggestions, coffee, cool water, bread and bananas for the children) and the location was perfect. A genuinely Greek area of Athens (so not too busy and with good quality and inexpensive little coffee shops and restaurants), a 10 min drive from the centre (€5-6 in a cab to downtown) and a private and secure garage space.  The view from the large terrace was outstanding, especially in the evening,  we all liked going back to the apartment in the evening, after a tiring day walking the museums and ancient monuments. We will definitely be back, in the cooler season, to experience some more of this fantastic city which is Athens."

It’s amazingly central. The building has windows on all sides which means that it is light and airy, but double glazing means it can also be very quiet and peaceful. The rooms are spacious and hospitable - Aliki has thought of all of the details. <br/><br/>It’s walking distance to anywhere we wanted to visit. There is a folder of useful information in English, French and Greek.<br/><br/>It was a real pleasure to be able to base ourselves here during our few days in Athens. Thank you Aliki!"

Πολύ καλαίσθητος ζεστός χωρος, η κρεβατοκάμαρα ονειρικη, ο κηπακος έξω είναι σαν να σε μεταφέρει σε μια γειτονιά εκτός Αθήνας! Μετρό και ηλεκτρικός πολύ κοντά για μετακινήσεις! Το προτείνω οπωσδήποτε..."

22082795,236377996,2018-02-19,4675478,Amanda,"Lamprini was a great host, she welcomed us with flowers and homemade sweets. The house is really nicely decorated and it is extremely clean! The view on the small orange tree yard is lovely, however in the winter when it is too cold to sit outside the apartment can be a little dark as it is underground and the sun doesn't reach... That's the only downside. The rest was great !"
22082795,250217024,2018-04-04,170986802,Xavier,"Lamprini is a great host, she always answers very quickly to our questions. She was there when we arrived and available during our stay. She provided explanations about how to get there from the airport and advices for visiting Athens. I certainly recommend this place for staying in Athens!"
22082795,253092248,2018-04-13,171661501,Benita,"Really modern, stylish space that was close to public transportation and a fully equipped kitchen. Lots supermarkets and dining areas close by!"
22082795,257661509,2018-04-27,166854879,Noreen,"The host greeted us at the door, showed us around & how to use the appliances in the apartment. She made us a fresh homemade Greek Salad & fresh lemonade from the lemons off the tree in the small garden off the patio. The patio is a nice place to relax in the morning & evening.  Beds were very comfortable & air conditioner in each bedroom worked well.<br/><br/>The hot water takes 30 min to heat for 1 shower.<br/>We did not feel the neighbourhood was very safe & were not comfortable to be out after dark.<br/><br/>It was close to a grocery store, transit system and walkable to the National Archaeology Museum."
22082795,260219932,2018-05-04,56844222,Tessa,"We really enjoyed our stay in Lamprini's wonderful appartment. It was spacious, clean and very cosy. Lamprini was a great and helpful host! She prepared a Greek speciality for us on arrival. She also kept in touch if we needed anything and informed us about events in the city (such as a strike in the public transport). I could really recommend staying here!"
22082795,260883835,2018-05-05,184037702,David,"Lamprini’s place is ideal if you plan to stay in Athens for a few days. <br/>The neighborhood is not the best in town, but ... <br/>- It is well located, only 2stops from the centre<br/>- it has a pretty decoration <br/>- super clean ! <br/>And most of all Lamprini is the most adorable host ! The communication was very clear, she made a self made souvenir for our wedding anniversary and prepared a delicious refreshing lemonade. <br/>And of course stayed at our disposal In case we needed her ! <br/>I recommend highly !"
22082795,263166768,2018-05-11,29719358,Caroline,"Nous avons passer un bon séjour chez Lamprini. L'avion arrivant tard dans la nuit, notre hôte nous a proposé de venir nous récupérer à l'aéroport, ce qui est vraiment très appréciable. Des petites attentions étaient prêtes à notre arrivée. L'appartement est conforme aux photos, propre et proche de toutes les commodités. Le métro est à quelques minutes, mais tout peut se faire à pieds. Je recommence Lamprini pour un séjour à Athènes et reviendrais avec plaisir."
22082795,264558118,2018-05-14,142383858,Lea,We had an amazing stay at Lamprini’s House.

Un quartier vivant et peu touristique mais pas loin des métros (5-7min selon la ligne) et des places touristiques à pied (15min de monastiraki). <br/>Lamprini est vraiment adorable et très réactive aux messages, hôte formidable !<br/>ce fut pour nous un magnifique séjour à athenes  !! On recommande !"
22082795,268790659,2018-05-26,1447825,Laura,"Sweet host, rapid communication and the flat is spacious. However its on ground floor so no sun on the balcony. Also its not directly in Exarchia, its 10min walk away and the area is very different to Exarchia. At night its a little bit dodgy, especially for women. All in all, good value for the space (2 bedrooms) and a really nice host."
22082795,272080624,2018-06-03,2548197,Leena,"While the neighborhood was not in the best area, it did not bother me whatsoever. (I live in New York City.) But those who are not used to the City should be careful especially in the evenings. It is also a ground floor apartment so if you have mobility issues, keep in mind that you have go go down 6 steps. That said, I felt like Lamprini's space is absolutely excellent and tremendous value for Athens. I loved it, felt safe in the flat, and we very much enjoyed our stay.  It was located between the red line stop Larissa Station and the green line stop Victoria Station, which made it very convenient to go around town and to/from the airport. We took the red like to acropolis, and we transferred to the green line from the blue line coming in from the airport. Lamprini gave clear directions, waited for our arrival, and even prepared some truly delicious tea! We were keen on the little neighborhood restaurants for takeaway and enjoyed breakfast most mornings at the charming patio with lemon and orange trees. The apartment was well-lit (we stayed during May/June), sparkling clean, possessed amenities like towels/toiletries, fully-functional kitchenette, and possessed an air of what it is like to live like a local in Athens. There are lots of little markets for groceries if you want to cook and mineral water. Lamprini also remained highly communicative during our entire stay and even informed us ahead of time when there was strike so we could plan accordingly with the metro being down. All in all, it was a fabulous stay in a clean and charming little flat for a lovely holiday. We would definitely stay again the next time we are in Athens :) Thank you so very much Lamprini! "
22082795,273775413,2018-06-07,134533743,Preeti,Lamprini welcomed us like a very good friend. We felt like home and we would suggest everyone to book this place. The location is perfect. In less than 15 min you reach the city.<br/><br/>The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Everything was available. We will definitely come back! Thank You very much again♥️
22082795,275477845,2018-06-11,116308946,Gabrielle,The apartment was in good walking distance to restaurants and public transportation. Lamprini was a great host! She had fresh fruit waiting for us when we arrived and took time to walk us to the train station so we knew where it was. She also helped us coordinate us with a ride to the airport. She was very helpful and great communication!

22082795,290195562,2018-07-14,16675854,Anica,"Lamprini's place is great! Very clean, comfortable and very accessible to the city center.

22082795,317421172,2018-09-02,133934974,Stefanie Vera,A nice and clean Appartement. One can easily reach the city centre via Metro. Lamprini is a friendly and helpful person. We enjoyed our stay in Athens   - the Appartement was one of the  reasons.
22082795,318632793,2018-09-04,38965029,Frederike,We enjoyed our stay a lot. Beautiful bedrooms and Nice Balkony. I can totaly recommend The Apartment for a weekend in Athen.

22082795,322431585,2018-09-13,199222758,Patty,"The space was clean and cozy, like the description. It felt luxurious to have two bedrooms with queen beds and ac in each. WiFi was very good. Location was great: close to a grocery store and a smaller convenience store, near the metro, restaurants and cafes. Great value."

Жили в Афинах два дня. квартира чистая, две спальни с большими кроватями, в ванне и на кухне есть все, что необходимо. В квартире есть балкон с лимонным садом, где приятно посидеть вечером. Квартира находится в пол часа ходьбы от центра города, в районе живет много приезжих, но как заверила хозяйка район безопасен. Спасибо, Ламприни, за гостепреимство."

22082795,331591503,2018-10-03,130705977,Katerina,"My stay at Lamprini's cosy apartment at the heart of Athens was a BLAST!First of all she was always there at my rescue when I needed Infos or Tips for the city or the apartment itself (location, public transport nearby) before I had even checked in. On my arrival day she was there welcoming me with flowers and an out of the world, homemade pastry (I mean, who does that nowadays !!), the first time a host (I Airbnb a lot) has down that for me!!!!The apartment was in an quiet block of flats that was just minutes away on foot from the two metro lines both of which lead also to the third one which connects the city to the airport. The apartment itself had EVERYTHING I needed (this is not an exaggeration!!!) from hair dryer and wine glasses to duvets and extra pair of towels , it was of exquisite taste and with a sweet backyard as bonus to enjoy a brunch Al (Website hidden by Airbnb) is with utter pleasure to say that I have met an incredible person/hostess and I look forward to going back again. A true MUST!!!!"
22082795,417153083,2019-02-26,55681089,Nicolas,Lamprini is a very friendly host who organised and decorated her flat with a lot of taste
22082795,431942096,2019-04-02,4986076,Elisabeth,The apartment is very quiet and relaxing. It has all the amenities you could ask for. Lamprini gave us a warm and friendly welcome and made sure we had everything we needed. The apartment itself is very close to the center and to the next metro station.

22082795,434572980,2019-04-08,191465164,Andrea,"AMAZING! Lamprini is wonderful and even brought us homemade snacks. The apartment is 400m from the metro (which is even easier to use than DC’s metro). Walk from the metro to the apartment is well-lit and populated at night. The area is so quiet and peaceful.<br/><br/>There is coffee, extra toiletries, a great selection of basic cooking spices, and adorable spaces with great personal touches. The shower is handheld (probs not a good choice if you have shoulder issues), but pressure is great and hot water lasts. There is a great space heater in the bathroom!"
22082795,436072239,2019-04-12,97141860,Dominique,"The apartment is beautifully designed, everything was perfect except for the neighbourhood. <br/>It is centrally located but at night we always had to take a taxi to get home, otherwise we would not have felt very safe (as two young females travelling by themselves). Apart from that, we totally recommend it!"
22082795,436941510,2019-04-14,220997630,Yunwen,"The apartment is not far away from the victoria station,  and the style is warm and lovely. Lamprini is very nice and gave us many suggestions on the place we should go to. Very good experience."
22082795,440613201,2019-04-21,121196285,John,Great value for money in the city centre but the surrounding area untidy and filled with graffiti.
22082795,447693269,2019-05-04,101795961,Michele,"Lamprini was very prompt and helpful with advice on Athens, where to go and how to reach the apartment, and the apartment itself looked fine. However, our taxi driver informed us (2 females first time to Athens) that this neighbourhood is considered unsafe by most standards despite being close to the city centre, and advised us not to enter this road/that road. Several earlier reviews have also mentioned that the neighbourhood is ""sketchy"" and did not feel safe especially in the evenings. We made the decision to switch to a hotel, but it's no fault of the host or the apartment itself. Just be sure you're aware of the neighbourhood's reputation before making a booking."
22082795,452393286,2019-05-13,70754863,Tomasz,Lamprini is a wonderful host. It is very helpful throughout the stay. The flat is great.

She even gave us information about ferries to neighboring islands.<br/>Her flat is a two bedroom. It is nicely decorated and cozy. <br/>The flat is only a short walking distance from the green line metro which makes it easy to get to it from<br/>The airport and to get to the downtown area and the ruins easily.<br/>My friend and I had a lovely time and would highly recommend!"
22082795,462300229,2019-06-02,20501798,Björn,Lamprini is a great host of the apartment. It was easy to get around the city and it is grat that the apartment has two cozy bedrooms.
22082795,464304538,2019-06-05,64519275,Valerie,L’appartement est bien et propre. Les lits ne sont pas très confortables. L’appartement est situé dans un quartier délabré mais tout de même à 10-15 min de marche du metro

22082795,478527891,2019-06-30,191441463,Holly,Amazing place to stay close to the grain station had great aircon in both rooms. When I booked though it was only one room but there were two. Greeted us with cold beers during the heat wave which was much appreciated really great place to stay could not recommend a better place

22082795,490131206,2019-07-18,25407035,Sarah,A nice apartment with a good kitchen set-up. Less than 10<br/>minute walk to the Metro and only two metro stops away from the heart of Athens. Lamprini was a very thoughtful host and promptly answered all my questions.

Zentrale Lage, 2 Metro Stationen schnell zu Fuß erreichbar, Supermärkte ebenfalls. Bad sehr klein aber ebenfalls gut ausgestattet. Wurden sehr freundlich begrüßt -  Ein- und Auschecken völlig komplikationslos.  Umgebung urban und lebhaft, jedoch keinesfalls unsicher."
22082795,523690070,2019-09-04,33190202,Bérénice,L’accueil de Lamprini était parfait. Elle est même venue nous chercher à l’aéroport car nous sommes arrivés tard <br/>L’appartement est proche du métro ce qui est très pratique pour visiter les endroits touristiques d’Athènes <br/>Et de petites attentions nous attendaient à notre arrivée <br/>Je recommanderai Lamprini sans hésiter
22082795,528394581,2019-09-13,41380111,Jayoung,"Host is really kind and check in was perfect. She prepared welcome drink and some bread for us. I am satisfied about this. But I felt neighborhood is not good a bit. If women stay alone, not recommend."

22082795,426564643714415200,2021-08-11,275864557,Mark,"My stay here was a pleasant and comfortable one. I was booked in for a month long stay. The bed was comfortable and having air conditioning in the room during July was very welcoming! The location was just two metro stops to the very centre- Plaka etc. Comunication with Lamprini was first class and she couldn't have been more helpful. I needed her help on one occasion and she was able to sort out effectively and promptly. Some reviews here say that the neighbourhood looks 'sketchy', however after my long stay here I can attest that I never saw anything to cause concern or felt unsafe. Young local women walk around Victoria square late at night seemingly unbothered. Some local men like to congregate in groups and chat together in the street which may intimidate those who are unfamilar of this custom, which is of course entirely normal in their culture. To sum up I think this apartment is great value for the location. Thanks again Lamprini for a wonderful stay! :)"

22082795,446062607456598710,2021-09-07,412669834,Heaven,"Lamprini was a lovely host, even though we never really had the chance to meet her personally. She welcomed us with snacks and drinks in the kitchen. The flat was as described. The only thing that really concerned us was the cleanliness. On our first day, we found a big, dead cockroach in the green room. Throughout the duration of our stay we kept finding small bugs in our beds and around the house, and as you can imagine, we were horrified as we immediately thought of bedbugs. In the end, with a bit of research,we deducted the bugs were nymphs of fabric eating moths or carpet beetles. Either way, we spent the last week thoroughly checking our beds before we went to sleep. Finally, a couple of days before we departed, we found another cockroach dying on one of our jackets, in the living room.<br/>We were very surprised that we kept finding these pests as we always had the net screens down when the windows were open.<br/>There is no denying that Lamprini has put her heart and soul on this flat and is very dedicated to making her guests feel at home. My only honest advice would be to just pay a bit more attention to detail.<br/>Thank you so much for having us, we hope to see you again soon :)"

22083550,268804381,2018-05-26,28705063,Andreas,Great experience in an unbelievable great house. The apartment is one of the best I have ever seen. George has an excellent style and a lot of fantastic details like an old gramophone or a type writer. For me as a writer on a travel to Athens more than lovely. The place is also one of the most interesting in Athens especially for younger people. Psirri is a hot spot and for people who like to take photos simply perfect. I will be back soon!

22083550,310883503,2018-08-20,10453218,Anisha,"George and Dennis' place was absolutely perfect! Its located in a lively neighbourhood, close to all attractions, 30-40 from the airport (which Dennis was kind enough to drop me off to in the morning upon request). The place was very uniquely decorated and had everything you would require and then some. Very comfortable, safe and a large open space to share with 4 guests (sofa opens up into a bed). Highly recommend a few nights here! "

22083550,321715381,2018-09-11,201203320,Stephanie,The apt is as beautiful in person as the photos online look!  The neighbourhood is fun with lots of patios to sit out on and is just around the corner from Monastriaki.  There is an elevator inside which is handy for someone like me who packs a lot.  George was awesome & even took us to the airport on our way out of town.  I highly recommend this apt!

One warning: bring ear plugs because the locals do love to party well into the morning hours! George was a communicative and friendly host."
22083550,345823632,2018-11-06,26777588,Ella May,"George's apartment is perfect for visiting Athens. I couldn't believe how close the Acropolis is and the area is really fun to walk around. The studio was quiet, clean and fitted with everything I needed. I will come back again next time I am in Athens!"

Plastic rain ponchos as well as a sewing kit, so they are truly prepared for anything. The place is not quite but this goes along with the fantastic location right in the center of everything. The bed could also be a little comfier but is certainly doable."
22083550,350372005,2018-11-19,78982856,Jeremiah,This studio might be my favorite place I’ve stayed through Airbnb. The location is central to anything you might want to see in Athens. The apartment is run in a professional manner and the check-in process is smooth and effective. <br/>The space is quiet and a great place to relax after a long day of walking around Athens.

22083550,354292169,2018-12-01,14739889,Yasmina,"I absolutely recommend the Pittaki studio for your stay in Athens.<br/>It has super beautiful interior, the pictures are more than accurate. Also cleaning and provided utilities where absolute en pointe. The location is also great, as you are walking distance away from the Ancient Greece and the beautiful Akropolis. If you wanna stay here in two or even all by yourself it is the perfect spot, cozy, practical and basically feels like home."

22083550,355660757,2018-12-05,80318186,Abdulrahman,Excellent place. clean and pretty on interior. Especially with the decorations. Only complaint is that the water isn't all that hot at its hottest. Especially since I was there in the December during the cold time. <br/>Overall very excellent place!
22083550,357419233,2018-12-10,60767711,Michaela,"I had an awesome time at the flat . If you’re looking for a cozy , stylish , and central location to everything look no further . I didn’t use public transportation after coming from the airport everything I wanted to do was walking distance . The only thing I will say is bring some ear plugs because there was Christmas music playing certain parts of the night from outside but I did not mind it at all :) Oh and the decor was everything ! They even had slippers for me so thoughtful ."
22083550,358118651,2018-12-13,45647045,Sam,"Had a great time staying at George’s apartment. Very convenient location and good bathroom and kitchen facilities.<br/><br/>This is unrelated to George’s apartment, but we had trouble with pick-pocketers on the street outside the apartment when we arrived late at night with our suitcases. So I would take extra care if you are arriving at night. Overall the area felt reasonably safe except for this one incident."
22083550,359031922,2018-12-16,229571867,Constandinos,"Great place to stay,amazing modern inside design.just 8-10 minutes from center on foot.<br/>Recommend 100%"
22083550,359584921,2018-12-17,23737316,Ruth,"The studio is beautiful, cozy and stylist. Definitely one the nicest airbnb place I stayed in. If you don't mind the crowd and loud music at night, you'll be fine here. If you're planning to go to Little Kook, this is the perfect place to stay since it's literally only 5 secs away. There's no more line at Little Kook after 22:30ish. A tip: Turn on the heater a few hours before you're going to bed to keep the place nice and warm."
22083550,361344347,2018-12-23,54478403,Joanna,"Studio Pittaki is a stylish, well equipped place, located in the lively heart of Monastiraki – the district full of nice cafes, bars and restaurants, close to the main greek historic areas. We had a great time staying in George’s apartment. It was easy and quick to communicate with the host, the place was clean and same as at the photos. The entrance to the building and the staircase itself were a bit scarry, also loud christmas music outside till 1 at night could be the obstacle but we didn’t bother that much afterall. I recommend this place, no doubt!"
22083550,362373494,2018-12-26,949232,Archana,"George's place is a large studio apartment with very unique and stylish decor. The location is great for exploring Athens. The Christmas decorations nearby added a very festive vibe to the neighborhood. The apartment and amenities were great. The only minor issue was that the noise isolation inside isn't great, so street noises and neighbourhood party sounds can be heard clearly into the wee hours of the night.... other than that it was a great place to stay."
22083550,364161462,2018-12-30,187282208,Anastasia,"We stayed at George’s place for two nights. The place is great, just like on pictures - very clean and with beautiful design. Location is the best part - few metres from best restaurants and bars!"
22083550,368819093,2019-01-08,218671848,Giovanni,"This apartment is perfect for all those spending time in Athens. I loved everything about the apartment!! Cleanliness and location are 5 stars! I was in athens for the only day of snow in ages and I enjoyed every moment of it. However, please remember that everytime you want to take a hot shower you have to remember to turn on the boiler for heating the water, which causes no problems but might be a bit slow if you were looking for a fast shower after a whole day out, but it's cool. I saw some reviews talking about the noise but there's nothing to worry about!! Nothing bad! Thank you george!"
22083550,400839087,2019-01-13,58326992,Panayiotis,"George is a very polite host! The appartment is very clean and looks exactly like on the pictures!<br/>It is located closely to the Monasteraki underground station, to which the airport train goes directly - no need to change means of  transportation.<br/>There are multiple cafes and street food options nearby, which are opened on Sunday as well. We highly recommend to have brunch at the ""A for Athens"" lounge, which is nearby - it offers a breath taking view to the Acropolis.<br/>George's appartment will be our first choice for our next Athens visit!"

22083550,448283381,2019-05-05,33527371,Kalliopi,"This studio apartment exceeded my boyfriends and my expectations. It was impeccably clean, modern decorated, had helpful touches (beverages for purchase, slippers, local made soaps and shampoo, even ponchos because rain was in the forecast!). The location was excellent and it took us less than ten minutes to walk to Monastiraki square. Lots of great rooftops, bars, cafes and restaurants in the area. We rented a car but didn’t need to use it at all. If you do bring a car, keep in mind you will probably have to park it in a garage nearby for about 10€ a day. We didn’t end up using our car because the area had everything we wanted within walking distance and we felt very safe walking everywhere, even at night. <br/><br/>Highly recommend this studio to anyone looking for the Athenian experience."

Don’t let the graffiti covered front door and dark interior hallway put you off when you open the main building door, it is well worth it once you make it upstairs to the apartment. The space is beautifully furnished, with so many thoughtful touches left by the hosts (sewing kit, maps, plastic cutlery sets for food on the go, etc.). The pillows were incredibly comfortable and the wifi and air-conditioning were great. To top it all off, the apartment is just a 3 minute walk to the metro station and 5 minutes to the Ancient Agora with views up to the Acropolis. Would definitely recommend a stay here!"

Dirty, difficult to find, and next to a place that plays loud music very late. That being said, George was a good host.

George answers quickly and really takes care to ensure you are safe and have a good time; he even told me about the earthquake that happened before I arrived and where to go and what to do if it happened again. The only gripe I have is the location; the front door is hard to locate and the Mary Poppins shop play loud music and attract loud guests all day and late into the night. Although I know this cannot be controlled it is something to be aware of. Overall I definitely recommend this place!!"
22083550,493908100,2019-07-23,11785225,Christos,"Georges place is just great! Superb location, very clean and very stylish. We only stayed for a night but still everything was great and George was kind to let us leave our suitcases at the flat way earlier than check in time <br/>Would definitely stay here again"
22083550,496153719,2019-07-27,9850834,Marina,"George’s place is excellent, in the best part of the city. Exactly like the pictures. Super clean and close to many restaurants, supermarket, metro. I definitely recommend it."
22083550,498721438,2019-07-30,120044858,Daniel,"Nice place, strange entrance with no lights in stair wells... despite this, it is a great place, near the main train station."
22083550,500350939,2019-08-02,273220482,Henry,"The apartment is cleverly designed, very clean, and perfectly located for the nightlife in central Athens."
22083550,505450752,2019-08-09,101382716,Kimberly,"George's place was exactly the same as the pictures; however, the outside is a bit sketch with a lot of graffiti on the doors and the elevator up to the room is kinda scary. We tried to walk up stairs and some of the floors were pitch black. Aside from that, the apartment was sparkling clean and really nice interior design."
22083550,506817925,2019-08-11,81955685,Effie,"The place was amazing. Location, spot on, the place was clean and decorated beautifully. The host was such a great communicator, George helped me with check in and also arranged a ride for me to the airport which was quite early in the morning."
22083550,507913890,2019-08-12,16733236,Imogen,"Excellent. Great location, easy check in, space is huge and very stylish. Lots of thoughtful touches like a mini bar you can buy drinks from, slippers, shampoo and shower gel. There’s a hairdryer ! A good one! Coffee etc. The list goes on. The space is great, the bed comfy - 100% recommend and would return for sure!"
22083550,509237684,2019-08-14,27192484,Martine,"Emplacement optimal pour visiter Athènes, quartier calme, plein de charme et surprenant.... Laissez-vous surprendre!  Vous serez au coeur de la créativité et des contrastes propres à la ville d'Athènes.<br/>Ce studio est décoré avec beaucoup de goût, les installations sont optimales, l'espace est vraiment agréable et très bien climatisé. <br/>Nous n'avons pas rencontré notre hôte mais toutes les infos via mail nous sont parvenues et tout était prêt pour notre arrivée."
22083550,510426746,2019-08-16,4261782,Maylis,The flat is very well located.
22083550,512307159,2019-08-18,42681737,Andrea,We loved our stay - very spacious and clean and the location was incredible!
22083550,513115230,2019-08-19,1474135,Sy,Lovely and stylish apartment in a fab location! Right in the Psirri district which was bustling and lively with eateries and bars but not rowdy. Wished i booked this for more nights :)
22083550,516403187,2019-08-24,98831100,Carly,"In terms of photos, the space looks exactly like what is pictured.  It's quite large and stylish with great decorations.  There are two things that I would note: 1. The bed is very hard; if you prefer a stiff mattress, then it is perfect for you, but if not the couch is comfy and folds out like a bed.  Secondly, In the summer months, Athens is extremely hot. While the place does have an AC unit, it doesn't go past a certain temperature and doesn't blow enough air to make it comfortable. While opening the windows, could be a good suggestion, at night it is a bit noisy so it could be a problem.<br/><br/>Besides that George is a great host! We had a water issue and he came right over and fixed it for us. The location is just one block from all the sites and some very good food."
22083550,516967443,2019-08-25,7800050,Gail,"Exactly like the pictures, great location and George is a fantastic host. Super easy check in, couldn’t ask for better."
22083550,519294106,2019-08-28,167535389,Aisling,"Fantastic place to stay, excellent central location, lots of space in the studio and very stylish and comfortable!"
22083550,520833518,2019-08-31,76390473,Jason,Great location and very nice apartment
22083550,524514952,2019-09-06,154593,Artem,"George's place was amazing! It was very centrally located, was easy to get to, and was incredibly clean and comfortable. Highly recommended."
22083550,524987817,2019-09-07,29344561,Francesca,Great location and super clean. Loved the interior and the bathroom was spacious for Europe! In a good spot for going out. Only 10 minute or less walk to the Plaka and 1 block away from the subway. Highly recommend this studio!!
22083550,527081022,2019-09-10,16557550,Capucine,Loved our stay in the studio. Very central and stylish. We had outgoing travel plans for the afternoon so weren’t able to leave our bags past check out but George kindly recommended a place to leave our luggage close by which worked well. <br/>Highly recommend!
22083550,529032474,2019-09-14,11831964,Marcus,"George is awesome as is this beautiful apartment. Talk about value for money! We’ve air bnbd all over Europe and this is by far the best value apartment ever. Stylish, clean and location is AWESOME! only wish I was there for longer!"
22083550,533111369,2019-09-21,185868524,Dan,"We stayed here for our short time in Athens on our way to and from the islands. This place is very clean and well kept, just like the pictures. George is extremely responsive and makes sure you get checked in OK. The location is extremely convenient to the metro, restaurants, bars, and the Acropolis. It's easy to get to both the airport and ports by metro, no cab needed. Great price, I would definitely stay again!"
22083550,534751622,2019-09-23,5227352,Shelly,"This apartment is in an amazing spot - just down from the so-cute Little Kook and 10 minute walk to the Acropolis. Super modern, comfy, cool and effortless to relax in. George was easy to work with and helpful. A must stay in Athens."
22083550,535799336,2019-09-25,16112515,Serge,"Accueil impeccable, l’appartement est conforme en tout point aux photos et description. L’emplacement est parfait."
22083550,536581998,2019-09-27,10853734,Sarah,"This was by far the most spacious and well-appointed and sparkling clean airbnb we stayed at during our time in Greece.   The apartment is beautifully renovated, super modern but totally comfortable and welcoming.   Many thoughful touches add to the sense of welcome - a frig stocked with cool drinks, cooking supplies, shampoos, slippers again all very tastefully executed.  As another traveller has mentioned, don't let the entrance put you off. This is Monasteraki afterall, the beating heart of graffiti and apparent grittiness.   Once you emerge from the lift up into George's place, you have the perfect contrast of impeccable and modern comfort.   The location is just a couple of minutes walk from the train station to take you to Pireaus or the airport ... or anywhere on the line. It is also a short walk to the Plaka and of course all the ancient sites.  A great location and a totally lovely apartment."
22083550,537698281,2019-09-29,41649623,Stephanie,George’s place was very comfortable and stylishly decorated. The location was fantastic - only a few minutes walk from Monastiraki metro and in a lovely neighbourhood close to lots of restaurants and bars. Walking distance to all the main sights such as the Acropolis.
22083550,538866981,2019-09-30,93701496,Emily,"You will feel sketched out by all the graffiti in the alley and the whole dimly lit horror vibe of the stairwell.. BUT once you get inside, the apartment is beautiful. Totally updated. The terrazzo floors are a standout too. George gave really solid food and drink recs.. where the hip young locals go. He was also prompt at responding. Also everything is super walkable from the apartment, which actually made up for the fact that the building itself was a little shabby. The bed was not comfortable, however, which was a bummer. Overall, absolutely would stay again though."
22083550,540284814,2019-10-03,84240371,An,"It is a very stylish and cozy apartment with all the amenities we needed. The street and building from the outside looks very eerie and dark but when you step into the apartment it’s completely different. The location is great and there are many bars and restaurants nearby, as well as a cool halloween cafe just downstairs along the streets! George is very responsive to our questions and helped us arrange for taxi to the port and gave us some recommendations for dinner. Overall a very good experience staying at this place and will recommend to everyone looking for a nice place to stay in Athens!"
22083550,543125910,2019-10-07,10150929,Charlotte,George’s flat is gorgeous! I would highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for a place to stay in Athens.
22083550,544411223,2019-10-10,104212828,Sacha,We were told by many people to be careful in this area as it can be dangerous although we did not experience this. The exterior may have been rough looking but the apartment was beautiful and the largest studio apartment we had stayed in in Europe. The area is filled with great restaurants at good prices and is walking distance to Acropolis.
22083550,544911864,2019-10-11,218584209,Χριστοφορος,"Εξαιρετική τοποθεσία , πανέμορφα διαμόρφομενος χώρος και καθαρός , γρήγορη και φιλική εξυπηρέτηση"
22083550,546017866,2019-10-13,18872350,Harry,Can't recommend this place enough. Beautifully designed studio flat with brand new appliances and great bathroom/shower facilities. All sparkling clean and well put together. The owners have put a lot of thought behind this studio flat concept and clearly care about the place. If you like to experience staying at the very centre of Athens and the quirky area of Psirri this is the place for you.
22083550,547819465,2019-10-16,66301481,Kim,It is very big and well-organized room but in the morning there was no hot water so I was struggling to take a shower with cold water.
22083550,550640014,2019-10-19,12801613,Chloe,Please don’t be put off by the street. Once inside the apartment it feels like another place.<br/><br/>It’s in a great spot. I loved the flea market down the road and my husband loved the Halloween themed desert cafe up the road!<br/><br/>The flat is spacious and has everything you need thanks to the thoughtful touches... including some handmade soap for sale. <br/><br/>George communicated really well with us and late check in was no problem.
22083550,552156774,2019-10-21,23855779,Nina,"The apartment was exactly as described. Communication was easy and quick! I felt very comfortable and had a pleasant stay. Only the noise level from the very lively street was a little disturbing. I recommend earplugs to sensitive people. Psirri is the perfect area to stay in Athens, many nice Restaurants, cool atmosphere, not too touristic and within walking distance to Akropolis and pretty much everything else in the old town. Metro Station to and from the Airport is just around the corner, 3 minutes to walk."
22083550,554323410,2019-10-26,62334475,David,"Great location, bad bed"
22083550,560868179,2019-11-08,1644948,Karl,We had a wonderful stay in George's apartment. There is plenty of space and the kitchen is well equipped. Thanks again for hosting us!
22083550,563202117,2019-11-12,8194014,Marie Et Pierre,"Très beau studio idéalement situé pour visiter Athènes,  chouette quartier pour sortir, et à deux pas du métro !"

22083550,579234765,2019-12-20,31342263,Susann,George's place it located very central in the city center. Loved that place... everything was good... communication with George was easy and welcoming.
22083550,584431509,2019-12-30,46799390,Anna-Maria,"George’s place was very clean and stylish. The check in was very easy and the communication with George was really helpful and fast. The greatest disadvantage was the noise and music from outside. The Christmas song’s was from 10am till 00:30 am and it was very loud. Moreover, I face problem with the water in the shower, it was very hot but I didn’t understand how to use it.   Overall, the apartment and the stay was very good the biggest problem was the outer noise. The location was perfect and extremely close to the metro station.  Thanks George xxx"
22083550,587475189,2020-01-03,10188047,Leonidas,"There’s no point in going on and on about the location, it is very central and ideal for anyone wanting to do some sightseeing around Athens. The check-in was incredibly easy and fast, the apartment was clean, it is spacious and well-designed, the sofa is comfy and the mini-bar is a nice touch, I would probably change the bed + mattress on a future update, while it would be great to have a floor mat or towel to step on when exiting the shower. I visited on a very cold day and it took a few hours for the apartment to become warm and cozy, it did not help that the duvet was paper thin and not suitable for this time of the year. These are details and friendly tips to elevate this place. Overall, I left satisfied with my stay, the location is very convenient and I can’t imagine anyone being disappointed with their experience in George’s loft."
22083550,588231747,2020-01-04,322158716,Ράνια,Πολύ όμορφο μέρος.

22083550,599529158,2020-01-30,45688207,Melina,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
22083550,601694504,2020-02-04,27715146,Anne,George's place is centrally located near Monastiraki station but still quiet enough for a good night sleep. What I was looking for. Thanks George!
22083550,603354593,2020-02-09,57737638,Sven,A perfect place in the very heart of Athens. I missed nothing – the interior is really awesome – everything was clean and welcoming. I definetly wanna come back!
22083550,604044952,2020-02-10,156225421,Costas,"Τέλειος χώρος, πεντακάθαρος και όμορφος,έχω πάει ήδη δύο φορές. Το μόνο του αρνητικό πραγματικά είναι η θέρμανση που δεν καλύπτει τον χώρο αρκετά και πρέπει να περιμένεις αρκετές ώρες μέχρι να ζεστάνει, και δεν φτάνει η θερμοκρασία μέχρι τα επιθυμητά επίπεδα."
22083550,604954595,2020-02-13,35715874,Nikolaos,"The Pittaki Studio is overall spacious, well arranged and very comfortable. It features all the amenities one may need during a short stay. A lot of attention has gone into the details. The description of the premises is accurate and communications with the host George were clear, polite and helpful. The studio is on the 2nd floor, but there is no view from the windows as across the narrow street there is another tall building. The location is excellent in terms of exploring on foot old Athens, the city centre, points of interest, bars, tavernas, etc. There are two metro stations with access to the airport & port within a few minutes’ walking distance. The facade of the premises’ building at street level is covered with graffiti and on a cursory look it is difficult to see the building number and the entrance door. The building’s corridors are in need of more frequent cleaning and  during my stay the outside street (Pittaki Street) stunk intensely of urine - careful where you step! Lone visitors should be cautious when venturing in the surrounding area especially during night time due to petty crime, though during my stay I did not suffer any such incident."
22083550,608993677,2020-02-22,31643683,Luc,"Good stay in this neat stylish clean place. Very central, street looks dodgy, but actually: super nice places around, apparently safe. George was super quick at replying to questions."
22083550,610342990,2020-02-24,226076170,Saulat,"Great location, near to the local attractions. Easy check in and out. Very clean apartment and with latest amenities. Just the place was a little cold considering the time of the year. Probably a bigger place needs a bigger heating system.. and the entrance to the apartment needs a little renovation and again that is expected by the building owner not the apartment host."
22083550,612272339,2020-02-29,304270720,Shaqeeb,"Really nice place and the host was very quick to respond to all my concerns, apartment was very clean and everything that was needed was not far away at all.<br/><br/>Location was good and close to a lot of different monuments and landmarks, but the cleanliness of the surrounding area was poor."
22083550,615044618,2020-03-07,259764481,Χάρης,Ένας αρκετά όμορφος χώρος σωστά διακοσμημένος με ακρίβεια . Το σημαντικότερο πρόβλημα ήταν η θέρμανση που ήταν ανεπαρκής για τον χώρο !!
22083550,617166540,2020-03-12,159712965,Ασπασία,Πολύ όμορφο μέρος στο κέντρο της Αθήνας! Όλα είναι δίπλα! Μια όμορφη πρόταση για το κέντρο.
22083550,667717725,2020-09-25,118499340,Giles,"Very stylish space, I only stayed for about 6 hours because I had a late flight in and early bus out but it was comfy and wish I could’ve stayed longer.<br/><br/>Only negative is the place smelled quite strongly of cigarette smoke - I know some places let people smoke in their apartments but I don’t like the stale smoke smell. It was fine for a night."
22083550,668301980,2020-09-27,229198003,Benjamin Und Andreas,"I had a great stay at the studio flat. Very big space, very cool and comfy. Definitely in the heart of the city. I enjoyed spending one day even staying inside, just to enjoy the flat and chill out from all the hustle.<br/><br/>As a host George was probably the most responsive and helpful, maybe because I kinda got myself into a pickle late at night, but he was on it in helping me out and also generous to help me feel better. Thanks again."
22083550,669511236,2020-09-30,8658475,Tyler,Stunning place! A lot of thought went into the final details. Would love to stay again
22083550,670081658,2020-10-02,4543838,Richard,George's studio really is excellently kitted out with style and attention to detail. It's also sparkling clean. He's super friendly and helpful too. Highly recommended.

22083550,673292585,2020-10-11,24248141,Andreea,Very nice Studio as on the pictures. George has been very reactive with me and answered in the same minute.  Good fournitures as hair dryer and iron machine.  <br/>What a pity that the street and the building are so dirty. I freaked out when I saw the building. Haha.
22083550,700742998,2020-10-16,297663237,Eleonora,Nice flat in a central area

22083550,704410641,2020-10-27,13048779,Rita,"The apartment was incredibly beautiful and George replied very quickly to my messages. The location is also great, very central.<br/>However, the street and the building are quite scary, especially at night, which made me fear for my safety. Nothing bad happened so it might be ok. Not sure if much can be done about the building though."
22083550,705272498,2020-10-31,43196637,Chris,This place is stylish and very comfortable. The apartment really is as beautiful as the photos suggest and it is located right in the thick of things. You really couldn't wish for a better location if you want to explore the local bars and restaurants.<br/><br/>The place itself is really well equipped and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. <br/><br/>George is an excellent host and was very quick in responding to all communication and they check-in instructions were easy to follow.

A few meters only away from the metro station, and just in the center of Athens. Communication with the host was very fast. The stay is perfect for young couples visiting Athens. My only issue with the accommodation was that the bed that was too stiff for my own taste. Keep also in mind that due to its location, the streets are very noisy all day and night. The main entrance may look a bit dodgy at first sight!"

It has two windows that open completely (having a balcony feel) which was relaxing. <br/><br/>The only down side for me was the bathroom is extremely small. The toilet is basically in the shower. There is a photo on air bnb of it, but it doesn’t quite show how small it is. Also there is a sand which press, and coffee pot with filters; but no cups, glasses, plates, utensils etc.<br/>So we couldn’t make anything unless we wanted to buy all the utensils & things which wasn’t worth it for two nights. <br/><br/>But realistically it’s such a minor issue, the loft its self is great. There’s plenty of restaurants around though.<br/>We didn’t get the pleasure of meeting Matina & George, however we did meet Aphrodite who was amazing. Super knowledgeable, she gave us tips on how to get around & she was very friendly. <br/><br/>When the booking was confirmed we received a detailed email about directions, with photos, details on exactly where to go. It told us how to get from the airport to the loft which was by fav my favourite thing. Definitely a special touch. <br/><br/>Overall, we had a great stay. It was comfortable, spacious & in a great location."
22090073,343951460,2018-11-02,151388017,Aitana,Really nice place. Close to the centre and very kind hosts.  there they are always that you need something.
22090073,347909019,2018-11-12,28687328,David,"This is a great place to spend a few days in Athens. Communication with the host was very easy and check-in instructions very detailed. The location is great, within walking distance to most major sites (we hardly ever used the metro) and lots of places to drink/eat nearby.<br/>On the downside, the place is a lot darker as the photos suggest as all the windows are completely covered with ads, so there is very little natural daylight. There is no ceiling lights either, so it is quite hard to make the place bright. Also, you pretty much hear everything that's happening elsewhere in the building or outside (to keep in mind if you're a light sleeper).<br/>All in all, it's a nice place to stay to explore Athens for a few days :-)"
22090073,353989401,2018-11-30,204449506,Katerina,Great loft close almost to everything by walk and very near to metro. Nice alive neighborhood! Definitely i will visit it again!

22090073,360599559,2018-12-21,9410852,Carmit,"The location of Matina and George's place was terrific! I walked everywhere I wanted to see in Athens. The area was full of restaurants and bakeries and felt very safe. Do not miss the amazing bakery around the corner at Anastasiou Zinni 25!<br/>The bed in the apartment was very uncomfortable (more like a cot) as was the couch (more like a bench). I didn't sleep well because of the bed.<br/>The place had a coffee maker and fridge but did not have plates, bowls, or mugs so eating in the apartment was not possible. <br/>Overall the place was fine, in a great location but missing some basic comfort."

22090073,411967508,2019-02-14,197663576,Diana Andreea,"Everything was great.  About the check in, we received detailed instructions about the hour and about the adress and how to reach it easily. The apartment was super clean. It s a really spacious and cozy apartment in which we felt so good. There you can find a fridge, a coffee machine and of course an air conditioning that we used it for heat. The neighboorhoud is safe and there are a lot of bars and restaurants with good prices and good food. We didn t use the transportation that much because we could reach easily by walking every place that we wanted to visit. The metro and bus station are 3 4 minutes away and by feet you can reach Syntagma in 20 25 minutes. <br/>So if we will visit Athens again, for sure we will stay at George's apartment!"
22090073,414316575,2019-02-19,238645947,Rafael,Really good place and really friendly.
22090073,423128708,2019-03-13,243453549,Lucija,George was a great host. He was available for any of our questions or requests. Apartment is on the perfect location (10 min walk from the Acropolis). In the neighbourhood you have dozen beautiful coffe bars (Luluk cafe is the best!) and restaurants with great Greek food. Apartment was clean and cozy and perfect for a couple. Highly recommended!
22090073,425382053,2019-03-18,234789251,Omar,Clean place in a walking distance from metro and from everything you need to see in the city center

22090073,438627547,2019-04-17,4182981,Sarah,"The flat is conveniently located and walking distance from all the major sites. Also, super clean and a comfortable bed! George's friend Aphrodite who runs a nearby cafe and helps with check-in is an absolute gem of a person too! Great hospitality--I would recommend this flat to anyone travelling in Athens!"
22090073,442682506,2019-04-24,53894416,Eusebius,"Place was clean and spacious, not much to complain about at all! Pretty easy to get around especially with the metro 5mins walk away. Aphrodite was the nicest person, she made sure we were well settled in and was always just a text message away when we needed her. She made us feel at home :)"
22090073,449222128,2019-05-06,252387548,Sabine,"Communication with Martina and George was super fast, the apartment ist very close to two metro stops and tram stops. WIth just one metro stop (or a little walk) you are at the acropolis and one more and you are in the midst of everything, hopping on the nearby tram will bring you to the beaches and everything is VERY easy to find from this apartment. Aphrodite who handed me the keys was super helpful organizing my transport back to the airport and also otherwise available for all my questions and needs. The only thing is that the apartment is situated in a noisy areay, I did not mind, as I enjoyed the Athens nightlife and then came back super tired and fell asleep like a stone but I can see how it might bother others, so if you are sensitive to noise, just bring a couple of earplugs and you should be good to go! Lots of bars and breakfast places around, a cute little wine bar right next to the apartment, too! Loved my stay in Athens!"
22090073,456257134,2019-05-21,16752583,Deepika,"Stay here to experience a different yet genuine side to Athens. We were glad to stay away from the Plaka area when we wanted to relax, yet it's close enough to walk to and get to all the main sights. The pedestrian walk near the house is where we spent all our time when we weren't exploring the main tourist sites in Athens. The house itself is clean & spacious. <br/><br/>Last but not the least, George is a warm, friendly and very helpful host. He helped us a lot with our travel logistics, and was always ready with fun suggestions for us around town. 100% recommend!"
22090073,460833887,2019-05-30,241842844,Alexander,"The apartment was sparkling clean and George was the best host imaginable. It is located in a nice area, surrounded by plenty of cool bars, cafes and restaurants. Don't miss out on Laluk Cafe right around the corner for a delicious breakfast. A lot of the famous sightseeing spots are in walking distance. Highly recommendend."

22090073,464204625,2019-06-05,43546466,Hemanth,"Though we never got to meet Martina and George in person, they were very responsive to our queries prior and during our arrival. The detailed instructions they provided us for getting into Athens and the apartment were extremely helpful for someone visiting Athens for the first time. Their friend Gina who helped us check in was incredible.<br/> The tips and suggestions we got from Gina ( food and sights) was all we needed for the first time in Athens. Gina was incredibly courteous and extremely fun to have a conversation with.don't miss the latter. The apartment is in a great location where you are really close to Acropolis on one side but still experience the traditional Athens on the other. We had a blast staying here and would highly recommend the place."

She talked me through all the good places to go for food and for fun, told me which areas to avoid, taught me about their bus and tram system. After check in, she responded quickly to my queries and was always warm and friendly, I couldn't have asked for better."

Very welcoming host who took time to explain to us the places of interest and the good deals in the surroundings! In addition, having a ferry to the islands early on the day of our departure, we were lucky enough to be driven to the port! Delicate attention that must be emphasized. Finally and most importantly the apartment is ideally located near the acropolis and the Plaka, everything is within walking distance! The apartment is clean and has all the necessary comfort! thank you!!"

22090073,476028440,2019-06-25,28863929,Solomon,Great spot. George was super attentive and helpful. The AC was a lifesaver in that Athens heat! The apt is right near a very cool pedestrian street with lots of great restaurants.

She gave us Restaurant Tipps (amazing !!), told us where not to go and helped us with every question we had during our stay ! The apartment is in a perfect location- it’s close to the acropolis and still within an area that’s not crowded and touristy at all. We can definitely recommend - this is a five star superhost."

Basic amenities like towels and aircon were included and it is in a convenient, safe and local area of Athens. But what made this 10/10 was Gina who greeted us and helped us to settle in!!

The host was really nice, hospitable and and very fast in answering at all times. Location is great, in a very safe area and 10 minutes walking from the Acropolis, and very well connected by public transport (bus and metro). Totally recommend!"
22090073,564548756,2019-11-16,306025786,Jack,"Martina and George's place is incredible. From the moment I landed in Greece I wasn't worried about locating their place. They had thoughtfully included a pdf on how to arrive at the destination from the airport that was very thorough. Once there and after some very friendly conversation with the host I was shown the apartment and given a run down on the map of things to try, do, and places to avoid. Not only that but they included a 10% off coupon I could present to a local bar down the street If I was hungry for some late night and authentic Greek eats and drinks. The host did not hesitate to mention that if I needed ANYTHING to text or call. The apartment itself was wonderful as well. Nice big bed, big windows that opened up and let me hear the rain falling outside at night. Plenty of space to unpack and sprawl out. For my week of staying here I didn't spend much time at the apartment however, not due to anything about the space but because I was so close to everything I could imagine seeing in Greece! It was only a 10 minute walk to The Acropolis and an even shorter walk to amazing bars, restaurants and cafes. You're also very close to public transportation hubs and walking 30 minutes in any directions will open you up to new, interesting areas all around. Do yourself a favor and stay here!"

Only one minor thing to note (which I think Matina is looking to resolve) is the bathroom water tank, which is kind of small for the toilet."

It is at one hundred meters of the metro station and the bus station. The apartement is surrounded by a lot of typical restaurants. <br/>I want to notice that the mattress is hard and the evacuation of the toilets may not work well.<br/><br/>I recommend this place !

They were super helpful and accommodating when my initial flight got cancelled and I had to arrive a day later.  Excellent communicators, helpful getting settled in the city, and the location can't be beat -- really loved the area, and in walking distance to the Acropolis.  The place has all of the amenities you need.  Thanks again, both!"

I wish all Airbnb hosts would be as her.<br/>Thank you for your recommendations, small guides and great small talks.<br/>Will be recommending staying in her accommodation foe all my fellows "
22090073,417787105663718263,2021-07-30,201688595,Julian,"Matina is a very helpful person and easy to talk to. She really cares about her guests and has a lot of good advices for food and acitvities. The appartment is really spacious and clean. The AC is little weak for this big appartment, but with the settings ""turbo"" and 16° you'll be fine.<br/>One little disadvantage is the noise from the mainstreet. So when you have a light sleep and don't like earplugs, it could be a problem. But it didn't bother us much...  I can recommend the place also because it's a very safe district and acropolis is in walking distance."

Not only did he arrange airport transfers for us, he also called the airline when they lost one of our bags. The apartment was very well appointed and comfortable. It had a cute balcony, good air conditioning and a washing machine which was appreciated. The neighbourhood was great, plenty of local places to eat and buy groceries. It is very central to all of the sites in Athens- we walked everywhere, but was also close to 2 metro stops. I highly recommend staying at Dimitris!"

22096126,444075958,2019-04-27,19753970,Maya,Dimitris place is wonderful! He meet us at checkin. He has a binder with local recommendations for food. He also has some board games to play. The place is very spacious. He provided coffee for us to make in his Nescafé machine. Great coffee! The washer works fine and he has a rack that you can use to dry your clothes on the patio. WiFi worked great! I had no issues at all. His apartment is my favorite apartment I’ve stayed in from airbnb. I felt very safe in the neighborhood. It was such a great value so close to everything. Go ahead and book this place you won’t regret it! <br/><br/>Side note: if Dimitri offers to schedule a taxi for you go ahead and have him schedule it. It will be the same price as it is at the airport. We declined and just jumped on a taxi from the airport and our taxi had a difficult time finding the place because I think our driver is used to just dropping off at hotels and we had to guide him with our map on how to get to the apartment.
22096126,474430854,2019-06-23,32229662,John,"This location is just the best. We didn't take any transportation walked everywhere. The food at the bars and cafes right around the corner were excellent. The location is literally in between the Acropolis, Acr Museum, and Temple of Zues. You just can't beat it. <br/><br/>Apartment was nicely styled and has a large balcony to enjoy some quiet time.<br/><br/>We asked for an earlier check in if possible when we booked which wasn't possible. However the day or so before check-in we were told the other guests were leaving earlier and we could come much earlier than expected. Appreciate him remembering our request and helping us out.<br/><br/>Wonderful apparment for seeing the ancient Athens."

In a few minutes we were in the historical heart of Athens, but at the same time the neighborhood is quite and makes you feel like a local.<br/>Dimitris is definitely a SUPERHOST and the best host we have ever had!!"

Definitely the place to stay during your visit to Athens guided by a lot of tips from a local.

22101833,313272129,2018-08-25,208434526,Reanne,"We absolutely loved our stay at Dimitri's place. From the moment we booked he couldn't do enough to help us and ensured everything was okay throughout our stay. Location for us was perfect. Restaurants, Supermarket and Train station within 4 minutes from the loft. Just be mindful if you need to get the early ferry that you check the front door is unlocked before you checkout. If we find ourselves in Athens again we wouldn't stay anywhere else. Thank You :)"
22101833,317440359,2018-09-02,37722801,Nathan,Idéal pour des jeunes pendant l’été. L’appartement est conforme à la description. Dimitris est quant à lui très disponible au cours du séjour si besoin est. Je le recommande vivement !
22101833,319640735,2018-09-07,15536992,Stefan,"Dimitris Unterkunft ist wirklich sehr zu empfehlen. Ein modern eingrichtetes Apartment mitten über den Dächern von Athen mit tollem Balkon. Alles was man braucht befindet sich in der Nähe, Metro, Supermarkt, Restaurants und Cafes. Dimitris ist ein sehr netter, freundlicher und hilfsbereiter Gastgeber. Er war immer ansprechbar und hat sofort geholfen. Hilfreich waren seine Tipps und Informationen, die er auch in einem Guide für seien Gäste zusammengestellt hat. Uns hat es bei ihm sehr gut gefallen."

22101833,334538152,2018-10-09,8995700,Bradley & Jenny,"Fantastic place and wonderful first impression of Greece. A few restaurants, including ""Best"", are just around the corner with reasonably priced delicious food. The place comes with all the cooking items you'll need. The host was always on top of everything and super helpful. He has a very organized booklet that'll show you where everything is. The train is nearby, but we walked through the park to get to the sights. Thanks again!"
22101833,337392934,2018-10-16,202176589,Mariela,"We enjoyed every second while staying in Athens! The apartment was clean and just like we expected; really modern and stylish design and the balcony... just wow!!<br/><br/>As a host, Dimitris was great! We arrived quite late but he was still waiting for us at the apartment and welcomed us kindly. So with the time schedules, he was very flexible. He also checked that everything was  fine during our stay.<br/><br/>The apartment is very close to everything. There is supermarket nearby and the metro is a few minutes walk away.<br/><br/>We couldn't have asked for more and we would gladly recommend the aparment for everybody visiting Athens!"

22101833,344807747,2018-11-04,218421670,Hannah,Dimitris’s place was a wonderful place to stay and had everything that we needed. Dimitris was a wonderful host. He was always so thoughtful and kind to us. Whenever we had questions he responded quickly and was always helpful. He also frequently checked in on us to make sure that we were comfortable and enjoying Athens. Which we were! Highly recommend to stay at Dimitris place if you are ever in Athens.

22101833,348499814,2018-11-14,3120126,Myung,"I highly recommend this place because:<br/>1.It is  run by a host who is very responsive, easy to communicate with<br/>2.  apartment  is nicely updated  with all necessary facilities for comfortable stay and <br/>     affords nice view of Acropolis from the deck<br/>3.  Five minute walk to a very nice supermarket for buy all provisions<br/>4. conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood that allows walking to all attractions plus five minute walk to a metro station for a 10 Euro ride to the airport and  2.40 Euro (RT) ride to the ferry terminal for a day trip to Hydra<br/>5. numerous quality and non touristic restaurants and coffee shops near the apartment (as mentioned in Demitris guidebook).<br/><br/>We slept well, walk to all over Athens and experienced the city, dined like locals, finished our days drinking wines at the deck while watching Parthenon glowing in twilight.  If this routine sounds good , book a stay at Dimitris.   A great place run by an attentive host.<br/><br/>Thank you, Dimitris."
22101833,350776454,2018-11-20,217554561,Michaela,"We liked to stay in this apartment. It is very near the metro and near Monastiraki. There was really good restaurant just next to the apartment and also market and coffee places so near. The apartment was so clean and Dimitris was really nice. I have been in 5 different airbnb apartments in different areas in athens and this we liked the most. If its sunny day, it is lovely to be on the terrace."

22101833,355666748,2018-12-05,31001471,Eileen,Dimitris' apartment is exactly as described and the added bonus is the good sized terrace with a view of the Acropolis. The apartment is very comfortable with everything you need. Getting around is very easy as you are only a few minutes away from a metro station. There is also a good sized supermarket minutes away. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the apartment.
22101833,357892239,2018-12-12,6498356,Kate,It was a pleasure indeed staying here. The view from the balcony is just incredible. The flat has got everything that u need and even more .  It is about 4 minutes walk  from the apartment to the nearest metro station and also very close to all city sights. Dimitris was absolutely amazing at helping me any time. He also gave tips on where to eat and go out! I totally recommend this place!

22101833,358628323,2018-12-15,225558767,Sonia,Good stay at Dimitris' flat. Amazing view on the sun rise behind the hill from balcony. you sleep perfectly with electric blanket and heater: good for winter. Clean flat. U are welcome with a bottle of wine. Lot of info on the area available. Very reactive person even if i had book at the last minute. I recommand this place.

22101833,366722066,2019-01-03,80479428,Chrisy,Dimitris is the best host we have seen!! He sent us messages during our stay and gave us the impression that we could really rely on him if anything came up! The only negative is the cleanliness of the appartement that should really be improved. Also the place needs quite some time to heat up in the winter because it is a penthouse. We used to return to the appartement late at night and it was freezing. Of course we stayed there in December...
22101833,367606108,2019-01-05,69471194,Thanos,Εξαιρετικό δωμάτιο και ο Δημήτρης φοβερά εξυπηρετικός. Αν είστε τυχεροί να το βρείτε ελεύθερο μην το σκεφτείτε.
22101833,400467218,2019-01-12,14665752,Eugen,"Great place, awesome view, perfect location.<br/><br/>I had a great time staying at DImitri's place and you shall too. Very clean, close to everything you need and within walking distance to Metro so you may see all Athens.<br/>Great information and advice from Dimitrion what to do and what to see."
22101833,401632266,2019-01-15,44998061,Nadia,Bilocale grazioso ben organizzato e in buona posizione. Dimitris è un host eccezionale.

22101833,430900332,2019-03-31,112258542,Jens,"Great host, problaby one of the cleanest appartment I’ve ever been to, unfortunately the shower is very narrow (about 2ft, 6in) and it was very noisy in the whole house at night."
22101833,433826935,2019-04-07,168350068,Trisha,This is a wonderful space in Athens. Close to public transportation and a block away from a cute little square with numerous restaurant options. There is a grocery store very close as well. We enjoyed our time!
22101833,435646439,2019-04-11,151611775,Mert,"Dimitri is a nice man. House was nice but just a little bit different with its photos, especially roof of the house.<br/>Very nice smelling house, thank you for Dimitri’s small present. I think the house is good for 3 adults. It’s not enough for 4 th and family with 4 person.<br/>The rest is nice..."
22101833,443052741,2019-04-25,106561704,Tiffany,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful and clean, and the location was fabulous. It was extremely easy to get to all the local attractions, and Dimitri gave us walking directions to everywhere we needed - the metro, the bank, and the grocery store as well as easy directions to help us get to the apartment from the airport. The shower was nice, the pillows were comfortable, and it was easy to do dishes to eat at the apartment."
22101833,445357539,2019-04-29,62777255,Piotr,"Location in a nice part of the city with a beautiful, full of sunlight balcony. Well equipped with a comfortable bed. Quiet and calm (the end of April) area during night and day as well. Perfect connection with downtown, max. 5 minutes walk to the underground station and 20-25 minutes to the Acropolis of Athens through the Filopappou Hill Park. Lots of shops/minimarkets including supermarket in vicinity of the apartament and a good restaurant with Frutti di Mare (1 min). Very nice and always helpful owner. Permanent contact with Dimitris if needed with his full support. Keys in a keybox so you can arrive late due to your flight connection and without any problems to reach the apartament.<br/>During our next trip to Athens definitely to stay in the same residence."
22101833,446364203,2019-05-01,8636398,Sylvia,"Dimitris appartment is really great stylish and super clean. We were overwhelmed.<br/>A bottle of wine awaited us for a start-up. Internet is excellent. <br/>Bathroom is cute, stylish, new tabs, water pression very good, modern.<br/>Dimitris served each 2 towels. Soap and other stuff was also there.<br/>Kitchen: Basics there including instant coffee, coffee-machine, water cooker, soap for cleaning dishes.<br/>In the kitchen is a glass table with 3 chairs and a sofa that could be changed into a small bed (1.30 or 1.40 m x 1.90 m length) Extra matress would be necessary for more comfort.<br/>The kitchen has access to the balcony as well. Excellent.<br/>More windows behind the sofa with curtains.<br/><br/>WIFI: Excellent<br/>Tipps: a dream<br/><br/>Bedroom: large, comfortable bed for 2 persons, 2 door leading to the balcony with view to the AKROPOLS at night when there is light. Bedroom is equipped with a huge TV.<br/>Location of the appartment and connections:<br/><br/>The location of the appartement is nice in a very local, but not touristic area, Exactly what we wanted.<br/>The Metro station PETRALONA is a 5 minutes walk approx. It takes 2 stopps to go to MONASTARKI only - where visitors find a very pittoresque market, flea-markets, restaurants and of course acces to the sight seeing they came for.<br/>We recommend to walk up to the top and start with the AKROPOLIS at first which can be done easily (even when being a little handicaped like me as my right ancle was broken 8 weeks ago and is still healing though it s still a bit swollen). With two healthy feet: NO WORRIES at all! Really!<br/>Sight seeing costs for all temples including AKROPOLIS shopping mall, Pantheon etc. was 30 Euros and you should go for it ! It s worth ! And the Greek wastes a fortune for restoring all cultural locations, columns and temples. Let s contribute!<br/><br/>Connection to Airport: a long way! at least 40 minutes at night / <br/><br/>Taxis:<br/>Just send a message to Dimitris and he will order the taxi for you.<br/>Normal cost: 38 Euro from Perseos 90 to the airport<br/>Extra fees for taxis at night / quite expensive-we paid 54 euros.<br/>No metros at night to the airport.<br/>No metros on National holidays! Attention!<br/>No ferries on National holidays!<br/><br/>Connection to the Piräus port by metro (direct connection from PETRALONA)<br/>Connection to the airport by metro : no direct lines: Take metro from Petralona to Monastraki and change metro there to airport.<br/><br/>Metro tickets: At Petralona is an automatic ticket system, you can choose any language. A 24 hours tickets cost 4.50 € and can be used the whole day. So keep it well! To get in a metro station position the ticket with its bar code on the entrance scanner. To get out do the same. Very easy!<br/>Ticket cost from Airport to Petralona was more expensive and costs 9 Euros one way.<br/>Right - I think I 've said all!<br/>So a very happy stay to everyone , ATHINA is a very good place to go! Enjoy!<br/>S & Rosslyn"
22101833,447832167,2019-05-04,258726471,Eien,Dimitris is a wonderful super host! Every time again!
22101833,448351891,2019-05-05,259244215,Rick,"This is a spacious apartment in a convenient location! I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone who is staying in Athens. This apartment is in a fantastic location for sightseeing, especially at the Acropolis. Also located close to public transit, making an easy journey from the airport or port. Dimitris also included a very detailed local information packet providing details on local shopping, restaurants, and other activities. Dimitris was also extremely responsive when we messaged him with questions. I would absolutely recommend this apartment!"
22101833,451091297,2019-05-11,2708472,Deena,"This was my first time using Air BNB, and I have heard plenty of reviews from people but wanted to experience it for myself. So here goes for the review, outstanding hospitality, great location, very clean, the added touch of the guide book on things to do, places to go and the map put this place over the top for me and my husband. With it only being located under 10 minutes away from the Acropolis and less than 5 minutes from the city by car it gave it an ease of access. Also, this location was within walking distance from bakery’s, coffee shops, and plenty of food places. At night you could see the acropolis lit up at night from the Balcony and even in the morning for sunrise. Again, I highly recommend. <br/><br/>V/R<br/>Deena Gaines"
22101833,451655874,2019-05-12,126481658,Dara,"Dimitris' place was in a safe, family neighbourhood and was located about 5 minutes from the metro station. This metro station was then two stops away from the city centre, which made it the perfect place to stay. Quiet at night, yet close to the city centre. Dimitris kept in touch weeks in advance and provided a handbook with information about the city, where to go and where not to go. The apartment itself was extremely clean, safe, with a nice view and comfortable bed. Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to stay in Athens."

If you want something quiet and away from the rush of central Athens, but close enough to walk to take the metro then stay here!<br/>Excellent amenities.

Dimitris answered any questions we had very quickly and made sure we had a taxi waiting to take us to the port I would definitely stay again.

22101833,484570123,2019-07-09,29991912,Trine,"Lejligheden er super godt indrettet. Altanen er et plus; vi fik ikke brugt den meget, da det var for varmt.<br/>Dimitris er utrolig hjælpsom og giver hurtig respons. <br/>offentlig transport fra lejligheden er virkelig nem; metroen fungerer bedre end i mange andre lande. Vi gik dog også til mange af de store attraktioner som Akropolis, Akropolis museet etc.<br/>Der er mange dejlige lokale spisesteder i selve kvarteret.<br/>Kvarteret virker nogle steder slidt- og er lidt ildelugtende, men kvarterets beboere er super flinke.<br/>Lejligheden kan klart anbefales."
22101833,488587647,2019-07-15,53516132,Luis,"Dimitris is a great host. Very responsive to all of of inquiries and have wonderful tips on things to do in the area. The location was close to the metro as well as local restaurants, cafes and shops. The top floor unit was very private and quiet. Despite being 3 adults, the space never felt cramped. Definitely a great place to stay."
22101833,490212212,2019-07-18,29385198,Sinead,"Dimitris and Tasos were two phenomenal hosts. Although we didn't have the fortune of meeting them, their guides and communication with us made everything incredibly easy.<br/><br/>They provided an excellent pdf and book with all the information you could possibly need for the area and getting around Athens. The metro stop was only 5 minutes away so everything was very accessible.<br/>The apartment was spotless and the terrace outside was great to have in the evenings.<br/><br/>The area was incredibly quiet in the evenings too which was great after being in the city centre all day.<br/><br/>I would 100% recommend this apartment for couples and single travellers or two friends.<br/><br/>Although the apartment was perfect, it was the hosts that made it even better by being extremely helpful and always available."

22101833,501820181,2019-08-04,25574786,Apolline,"Très bon séjour chez Dimitris. L’appartement est conforme aux photos et descriptions. Il est spacieux et la terrasse agréable avec petite vue sur le Parthénon. Il est proche du centre (15 minutes à pied ou 1 station de métro), nous avions une voiture de location et les emplacements en bas de l’appartement sont nombreux et surtout gratuit donc parfait. Il y a la clim et la wifi donc idéal quand on veut se reposer. Malgré quelques soucis à l’arrivée avec la clim, Dimitris a su être très réactif et disponible pour nous aider à régler les problèmes de manière efficace. À 200m de l’appartement vous trouverez un supermarché bien équipé type carrefour. Je recommande !"

The apartment was clean, we had everything we needed and really liked the view from the terrace. There is a book with all information you need about bars, restaurants etc. The hint to visit the rooftop bar „anglais“ made our last evening! <br/>-highly recommended- !"

22101833,528958676,2019-09-14,31097996,Giulia,"I'll make it short: Dimitris and Tasos are the best hosts we've ever met. Their flat is a real gem, super clean, stylish and comfortable, it's got everything you might need and from the balcony you can even spot the Acropolis! It is in a lovely building a few meters from Petralona station, which is very close both to Piraeus and the city centre. Excellent position indeed, the neighbourhood is quiet but well served (supermarkets, tavernas, Atms, anything).  Their hospitality is exquisite: not only were we greeted with a bottle of white wine, but they also left us a booklet (a binded booklet!) with all the useful info about the flat, the neighbourhood, the city, the closest beaches... everything, washing machine instructions included (which we enormously appreciated as we can't read Greek very well). Perfect, just perfect, beyond recommended. Thank you so much, guys, we love you!"

There are many pubs , restaurants in the neighborhood. We could even go training to CrossFit Kallithea (10 minutes walk) .<br/><br/>Dimitris is a super host , very responsive and always ready to help . <br/><br/>The apartment was clean and tidy , and it is always great to have a terrace :-) .<br/>I loved the guest manual that provided useful information in relation to the apartment, the restaurants and what to see in Athens . We bought our movies downloaded from Netflix but that was not necessary as the apartment has its own Netflix subscription.<br/><br/>I absolutely recommend Dimitris’s flat , we spent there 7 nights ."

The apartment is located in a very good area with shops and restaurants close by. You can reach the tram station in just a few minutes to go to the main spots of Athens. The rooms are very beautiful, modern and clean. Moreover, Dimitris took a lot of attention to details by providing even slippers for the house, umbrellas and a sun hat! The guidebook was very handy. Thanks to the awning we really enjoyed spending time on the terrace despite the heat. We have been very surprised that we could even see the Acropolis! We would definitely recommend Dimitris apartment."

22101833,665250955,2020-09-18,105008168,Stefan,"I booked the place for a couple of friends who couldn't stay at my apartment. I expected them to mainly just sleep there, but we endet up hanging out at the apartment more than at my place. It's all you can want for a couple and the terrace with a view are just great. Especially if you had a few long nights and just want to stay in for once and relax. Personally I might be biased towards my love for the neighbourhood but Petralona is just a fantastic point to stay because everything is easily accessible and you can even walk to the city center in 20 minutes if you're not up to taking the train. The hosts were sweet, helpful and super quick to respond - even patient with my forgetting to write a review (for which I apologise publicly) :) If you're looking for a place that is cosy, quite, accessible and yet close to everything definitely give it a try!"

22103455,291601495,2018-07-16,83855753,James,"This is a first-class elegant flat - minimalist in style, but with all mod cons.  It is within easy walking distance to a host of really good restaurants and shops, and handy for all the major Athens sites.  We'd recommend it strongly - a great place to stay.  And Toni and his team could not have been more welcoming and helpful - lots of trouble to sort out arrival and departure arrangements, and to help guide us for a great stay in Athens.  All in all a five star experience - thank you!"

22103455,313276409,2018-08-25,4199365,Sabri,L’appartement est parfaitement neuf et propre : c’est agréable ! Un joli parquet et des meubles épurés habillent l’ensemble.

22103455,321385663,2018-09-10,25663451,Kara,"We had a wonderful time at Toni's apartment. It was a HUGE space, perfect for the six of us, and it was very clean and well taken care of. The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms were spacious clean and modern. There is a balcony off of the living room and two of the back bedrooms have doors leading out to a large patio. It's up one flight of stairs and while there is an elevator I would not recommend using it, it's very small and old. Like most of Athens, the neighborhood took some getting used to with the graffiti and alleyways, but we never had any problems and we regularly were out late at night and walked back home. The location was great, about a fifteen-minute walk to the Acropolis and close to tons of cafes and museums and right off of a main street with tons of shopping. I definitely recommend walking around the neighborhood to get a feel for it before you judge on first apperences, in my opinion, Athens is a hidden gem."

22103455,324449270,2018-09-17,121046901,Laurie,"This apartment in situated in a vibrant, bohemian area.  It is close to shops and about 20 min walk to the historic centre of Athens.  Leaving the building, turn left and left again for many great restaurants.  The descriptions and photos are accurate, the beds comfy and the showers good.  We walked everywhere, but public transport was available nearby if needed.  Contact with Toni was easy, with quick replies.  Check-in worked well.  We (5 girl friends) had a great stay."
22103455,328841457,2018-09-27,10730570,Angela Jo,"Really great space for a large group! Toni was very welcoming with an in-person meet & greet and tour of the space introducing the features. Plenty of stores nearby, convenient to mass transit, but quiet in the evenings to get a good night’s rest. It even has a little outside patio! Beds were super comfy, lots of extra linens and pillows for those who may end up on the couches. Water runs hot - which is great! Amenities include a working stove, microwave, a washing machine if you need to do a load of laundry, Korree’s branded toiletries for each room with two sets of towels per room for double occupancy. Strong wi-fi signal throughout the unit. Unit is large, spacious including the bedrooms. Very modern touches and look. Highly, highly recommend. Would stay again!"

Market , Academia etc).<br/>Very commercial area, so night time is a bit abandoned and we were told by the neighbors that the area is not the best to walk alone after 10 PM.<br/>Many small bakeries and coffee shop around. 15 minutes walking from Kolonaki square."

The neighborhood and the building are not pretty so you will be surprised with the apartment! <br/>Definitely a 5 stars experience. Comparing with other Airbnbs now I think I should’ve given them only 4 because tony really deserves the 5 :) <br/><br/>A separate note on Greece: bring a mask because it’s toxic! Everybody smokes! Even in front of children :( <br/>+ the smog in Athens it’s like you’ve smoked 10 years by the time you leave!

Even the center of  Athens and most of the places to visit can be reached on foot. The metro-station is not far, but we didn’t use it. We enjoyed our stay a lot! Toni is not so much a private person, but rather a company owning 60+ apartments in Athens. But they do a wonderful job! We would certainly come again."

It is located very conveniently for the tube station, but in fact we chose to walk everywhere as all the main tourist sites are within a 20 minute walk, many nearer. There are small food stores near by and lots of little cafes and restaurants. All communication with Toni was very quick and easy. He even organised a mini bus to take the 6 of us to the airport at the end of our stay. We would really recommend this place."

Some great restaurants and coffee shops walking distance. Location is convenient to all the tourist hot spots via metro, cab and even walking if you like to explore by foot.

The sink in the main bathroom was plugged and it took almost 24 hours to fix.  Once it was fixed, it was much more comfortable for everyone.  The pictures show a Nespresso machine and pods. No pods and when asked for some advised that they don’t supply - just instant Nescafé.  Please take the pictures off if you don’t supply, this wouldn’t have been an issue if the pictures weren’t there.  There is no store close which sells the pods.  We would try this apartment again, as it was very clean and convenient. I would just check sinks drain while being given property tour.  I would also bring my own Nespresso pods.  Thank you!"

We had a late flight our last day, host was kind enough to push our check out to later and we were able to keep our luggage as at the office until we had to head to the airport so we didn’t have to carry our luggages around town.

We arrived in Athens in the morning, and our check in time wasn't until 3pm. Toni offered to hold our baggage at his office while we went to the flea market. This was such a relief, and very appreciated.<br/><br/>Toni's apartment was as described. Contemporary, minimalistic design and a lot of open space. The rooms very spacious.

The location is perfect, walkable to everywhere I needed, including only about 10 minutes to the metro stop, and about 20-30 minutes to the Parthenon. The price is great, and the host was very communicative and easy to get ahold of with any questions or concerns. This is definitely a great place for a group to stay."

It is also in a great walkable location nearby restaurants and shops. We appreciated all the modern appliances -the water temperature and pressure were fantastic. Highly recommend!
22103455,427275271150387420,2021-08-12,123647715,Austin,"I rated this stay a 3 but it could easily be improved to a 5 with some attention to detail. I’ll start with the pros. The apartment is huge, bigger than I was expecting. Vary spacious and modern, the beds were comfy. The A/C worked great even though one bedroom didn’t have a remote. Exarcheia is a very neat neighborhood, good restaurants, bars, and vibes. We were able to store our luggage early at an office less than a mile from the apartment since we arrived early in the morning. <br/>The cons, which like I said could easily be improved. Some things seemed kind of cheap. The hand towel holder in the small bathroom falls off the wall if you try to put the towel on it. The garbage lid under the sink is setup to open when you open the cabinet door, this was broken when we arrived but I fixed it for them. The shower doors can’t close entirely and leak. I would expect an apartment with such reviews to be a bit cleaner. In the small bathroom there was some ripped up toilet paper and rubble (??) when we arrived. There was a sock under the bed (possibly still there). If you walked around barefoot you could tell that the apartment hadn’t been swept recently. This was also the first listing I’ve ever stayed at that provided a washer but didn’t have detergent. I think part of the problem might be that there are too many people involved. We dealt directly with 3 different people on our day of arrival who were all very nice, I think the Toni profile is possibly a group of people, but it was a bit confusing."

22103455,465646917966438918,2021-10-04,49898412,Liana,"This unit was perfect for what my group needed! We were going on a cruise that departed from Piraeus Port. We had a totally of nine people who were arriving over the course of a few days and we wanted to stay together for easy of transport the day of the cruise. Toni’s apartment made sure that everyone had a bed (although one night someone slept on the couch), and enough space to spread out and be comfortable. We staggered showers, and everyone had enough hot water. The Nespresso was well appreciated so we could have a shot to start our days. When the last three people joined us on the day we checked out (12 people totally with lots of luggage) and there was enough space for all, I was really impressed. <br/>Just a note that this unit is not on the ground floor, and the elevator is very small (like maybe two people with backpacks, which is common in Athens). For us we ended up relaying suitcases down the stairs rather than use the elevator for everything (which we probably would have had to do one suitcase at a time). The elevator did work out great for grandma, while we carried her wheelchair up and down the stairs."

22118170,219826892,2017-12-19,1641750,John,"Dimitrios met me at the door and showed me around the apartment. He also helped install the WiFi, which was not available on my first day and night. The apartment is located in a quiet residential neighborhood close to public transportation, but about an hour away from Central Athens if you walk. Would recommend for single travelers who want to get away from the hustle and bustle of downtown."

22118170,226722687,2018-01-12,5075317,Peter,I had a lovely time in this quiet and slightly removed spot. The 40 minute walk to the city center was easy and interesting.  Dimitros met with me to show the room and layout. Well priced and placed for a single traveler.
22118170,240980312,2018-03-07,165069927,Agathi,"The house is in a central area not far from the city centre. The train ( metro) station it’s really closed to the house which makes things easy if you want to move around the city.  There is a coffee shop right next to the house and a market is about 5 minutes far from the house. In the house, there is a kitchen and a bathroom that you need to share with other (Hidden by Airbnb) . I really enjoyed my stay at Dimitrios house and I would book this house if I ever travel to Athens again."

22118170,250442549,2018-04-05,31053281,Colleen,"This is a nice, simple apartment in an authentic Athens neighborhood. It was nice to be in a non-touristy area in order to get the real feel for the city. You are still close to public transport and the bus/metro to the airport, so it is pretty easy. I only stayed one night, but unfortunately the neighbors in the building were a bit loud, or maybe it was the sound of the elevator. I think the walls are thin or maybe it was just that one night, but I didn't get the best night sleep! I should have known though because the description puts that there is potential for noise so I guess just take that into consideration. You share the apartment with other Airbnb guests, who in my case were nice! Dimitrios is a wonderful host. He was really nice and waited for me even though I was late for when I said I would arrive and offered to let me stay later than the check out time. Thank you so much Dimitrios!"

He always responded quickly to my questions. I arrived at midnight in Athens and he waited up to greet me with a smile on his face. <br/><br/>He was easygoing with check in and check out times, and he let me leave my bags at his place the day of my check out since I was leaving late and wanted to walk around the city.<br/><br/>The building is minutes away from the metro, making it very convenient to get around the city (and to spend less time walking alone at night for solo female travelers). The apartment was cozy, the room was clean, the hospitality was superb. Thanks again Dimitrios!"

A fantastic host!<br/><br/>The location is super close to the nearest metro station. It would take about (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minutes to get to the city center (stations: Syntagma, Monastiraki, and Akropli). There a few cafes nearby to grab food, a couple local supermarkets (between the station and the flat), and a bakery. There is also a school across from the building.<br/><br/>I had two other (Hidden by Airbnb) who shared a room. The kitchen and the bathroom are shared. The room is simple (a bed, a wardrobe, and a bedside table) but has everything I needed and was comfortable. I was able to lock my room when I leave the flat. Staying here felt pretty safe.<br/><br/>Overall, great value for the price paid. I would stay here again and would definitely recommend budget travelers to stay here too!"

Hosts were very responsive and helpful. The neighborhood was bustling and was a nice relief from the tourist-packed streets in the center of town. Pro tip: the X93 bus from the airport drops off just a few blocks away. Consider it as an alternative to either the Metro or other buses from the airport."

22118170,322795981,2018-09-14,8159602,Noel,"I stayed in one of the two rooms rented in this apartment.   The apartment is up one flight of stairs within easy walking distance to both the Loission KTEL bus station (Terminal B)  and the metro, as well as nearby neighborhood restaurants.  The room, cooled by ceiling fan, could be locked from both inside and outside -- which I truly appreciate when staying in a place that rents more than one room.  Communication was excellent (in English for me) -- including accurate directions and convenient access.  An excellent value for the overnight stay I needed between my return from Delphi on the public bus -- and getting to the airport the next morning by metro."
22118170,324462177,2018-09-17,57473445,Amr,"It is really my best experience in airbnb.

Хорошо, что по соседству с входом в жильё находится кафе,где всегда есть люди. Квартира простая, как раз переночевать и отдохнуть, самое прекрасное, что хозяин знает русский язык, он очень гостеприимный и общительный."

The room was spacious, clean and comfortable and Dimitrios was friendly and prompt to reply my messages. Recommended for a great value stay in Athens!"
22118170,333301754,2018-10-07,217235307,Stanislav,Good place not far from the city center.
22118170,334525276,2018-10-09,835937,Karin,"Before I came to Dimitrios' apartment, I had stayed in a 4-star hotel in Metaxourghio in Athens that was not safe and so noisy that I could hardly sleep. Dimitrios' apartment is much better! It is so quiet and homely that I felt very well because it is in a good neiborhood with private houses and in a pedestrial zone in front of a school. The rooms and the whole apartment is well-kept by Dimitrios. Everything is clean. You have to share the apartment with only 1 or 2 persons living in another room. I enjoyed talking to Dimitrios and other guests. Dimitrios is a very friendly person. I highly recommend his apartment to people who know exactly what it means to have a nice place to rest and to stay in a nice, safe quarter of Athens without having to spend heaps of money."
22118170,334848261,2018-10-10,128023644,Alejandro,"Dimitrios fue un excelente anfitrión, muy atento y amable. Tiene la ventaja de que habla varios idiomas. La habitación muy limpia y con buena ubicación. 100% recomendable."

22118170,340216800,2018-10-23,5810195,Emilie,"Dimitrios's place is lovely: Its location is excellent since it is very close to the train that goes directly to the center, but also to the bus station for the airport bus. It's in a really nice neighborhood with many grocery stores and low key coffee shops around, and the apartment is in front of a school. I loved the room I rented because it's enormous, with a cute balcony, and a spacious armoire. There is even a little desk which was super convenient to do some work, and the bed was very comfortable. Dimitrios was always available to help for whatever, and he helped me find my way around Athens. I highly recommend Dimitrios's apartment!"

22118170,345809110,2018-11-06,216231635,Sabrina,"You definitely get what you paid for. The bathroom was my biggest issue, having to manually turn the water heater on and off to shower, and having to hold the water faucet if I wanted to wash my hair in the shower instead of taking a bath? And the toilet doesn't flush toilet paper, he asks you to throw it in the trash. Other than those things and a kind of weird smell, the place was okay to crash for the night but nothing more."
22118170,348793813,2018-11-15,19290943,Abdullah-Al,Stayed in a nice city with a great host!
22118170,349721560,2018-11-18,17982953,Nihal,Dimitrios is a great guy and very friendly. His house is very well located and super close to the Metro station. The check-in process is very easy and Dimitris takes a lot of trouble to make sure that I felt at home. I will certainly stay here again if I come to Athens.

Dimitrios is a very nice guy, very willing to help with anything! one thing to note is the shower had to be heated by turning on a switch connected to the water heater. I was instructed to leave it on for about 25 minutes before bathing and then to turn it off for a warm shower. nope! freezing shower! I tried everything, leaving it on for an hour, showering with it on, etc. If you're going on the winter time, prepare for a cold shower. other than that, the stay was lovely."

Very affordable and cost effective as it sits right next to the metro station that can take you anywhere in the city along with a bus stop about 10mins walk away.

The room it self is super cute, and clean!! They are also quite a bit spacious. You only share the apartment with one other traveler and I think you get much more than you pay for. Also Dimitrios is such a sweet host if you get the pleasure to meet him and hear his travel stories you are in for a treat. If his on one of his frequent travels I recommend giving his blog a read."

I really surprised its decent quality for the price (mine was €63 for 2 nights)<br/>If you still wonder its quality, please see below. I described pros & cons.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>>Walking distance to historical sites (e.g. 10 min walk to Acropolis’s entrance)<br/>>Safe & Not crowded location compare to Syntagma, Monastiraki and Omonia area<br/>>Clean & Modern private room with the lock system<br/>>Plenty of equipments; big clean bath towel, shampoo & bath gel (in common bathroom), big fridge & basic kitchen goods (in common kitchen)<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>>Sensitive person might care a traffic noise at night, but it can be solved by earplug.<br/>>The key for private room is quite simple, yet I already made sure each key is unique. <br/>>The bathrobe and small shampoos which you can see on the photo is not including their offer. However, A shampoo and a bath-gel is available in common bathroom. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, If you could find any big concern in those details, I just recommend you to book some proper hotel which costs over €100 per night.<br/>_________________________________________<br/><br/>この価格帯において､かなりｵｽｽﾒできる物件です｡私の場合2泊で63ﾕｰﾛでしたが､非常にｺｽﾄﾊﾟﾌｫｰﾏﾝｽが高いと感じました｡<br/>一応､下記に良い点/悪い点を挙げていますが､値段を考えればどれも許容範囲かと思われます｡<br/><br/>【良い点】<br/>･歴史的ｽﾎﾟｯﾄへのｱｸｾｽがかなり良いです｡特にﾒｲﾝどころであるｱｸﾛﾎﾟﾘｽ付近へは徒歩5~10分｡<br/>･比較的治安が良さげで､かつ観光ｴﾘｱから少し離れて落ち着いた雰囲気です｡同じくｱｸﾛﾎﾟﾘｽから徒歩数分のﾛｹｰｼｮﾝでも､MonastirakiやSyntagmaの辺りは混雑していて雰囲気も悪いです｡<br/>･簡易な鍵がかけれる個室と共有のﾊﾞｽﾙｰﾑ&ｷｯﾁﾝがあり､写真とそれほど遜色ないくらい清潔でﾓﾀﾞﾝです｡建物自体は古いですが､綺麗にﾘﾉﾍﾞされています｡<br/>･設備も値段の割には良く､まず個人用の大きなﾊﾞｽﾀｵﾙが部屋に置かれており､共用にはなりますが大きめの冷蔵庫や最低限のｷｯﾁﾝ用品が｡同じく共用ﾊﾞｽﾙｰﾑにはｼｬﾝﾌﾟｰ､ﾎﾞﾃﾞｨｿｰﾌﾟも揃っています｡<br/><br/>【悪い点】<br/>･大きな道路に面していることもあり､夜中になっても車の音が割と聞こえます｡気になる方は耳栓などで対応を｡<br/>･一応鍵付きの個室ではあるんですが比較的簡易な鍵なので､外出時には本当に貴重な品(ﾊﾟｽﾎﾟｰﾄなど)は携帯することをｵｽｽﾒします｡それでもﾄﾞﾐﾄﾘｰなどに比べればﾌﾟﾗｲﾍﾞｰﾄはしっかりと確保されています｡<br/>･掲載されている写真に見られるようなﾊﾞｽﾛｰﾌﾞや個人用のｱﾒﾆﾃｨは実際には提供されません｡ちなみに歯ﾌﾞﾗｼ等も無いのでご持参ください｡<br/><br/>以上です｡それでもどうしても上記の点が気になってしまうという方は､やはり100ﾕｰﾛ以上のちゃんとしたﾎﾃﾙに泊まられた方が良いと思います｡"

The room also had a nice souvenir to take home with you! The place is central to everything! You are in the heart of the Athens and in the nice area. You can walk to all the world known sites. The area is restaurant and shopping galore. Only thing if you don’t want to hear your neighbors, I recommend taking some ear plugs with you. Highly recommend this place!"

The apartment itself is very basic but sufficient. It served my purpose - I just needed a place to lay my head down at night. But it's not a place to ""hang out"" during the day (no living room/common area - just the entry, 3 bedrooms, a bathroom and a small kitchen). "

Area Slightly light industrial however excellent value and perfectly quiet and comfortable sleeps. <br/>Bathroom and kitchen areas are communal.

Le Check-in avec la box est un peu surprenant mais tout est très bien expliqué et très facile! La location est bien, à 5 minutes du métro akropoli donc proche de l’acropole. La chambre donne sur une sorte de boulevard mais elle est très bien isolée de la lumière et du bruit, on y dort très bien! <br/>On ne peut pas laisser la valise après 11h (check-out) mais il y a de nombreuses consignes à Athènes, dont une proche du métro que Tia and Mike recommandent et que j’ai utilisée. La cuisine et salle de bain partagées sont très propres et pratiques. <br/>Je recommande cette chambre! <br/>Thank you Tia and Mike !"

22121376,341103376,2018-10-26,43453062,Guylaine,"I stayed 5 nights at Tia & Mike apartment.  I can tell you that it's a great place to stay.  First, very well located, 5 minutes walk from Acropolis Metro Station, close of everything ( bakeries, groceries, restaurants etc,,,,,by walking.  I never used transports during the week,  just walking everywhere. VERY secure apartment , 3 keys before entering in your room.  The process of entering, at the first time in the apartment,  seems complicated, but NOT AT ALL, very easy. Don't be afraid because the owner is not there and we do our entering by ourself with master key box and code.  Very quiet place, very clean ( a lady comes everyday and make sure we do not miss nothing), hot water for shower, air conditioning silent and working very well, WIFI very fast, big fridg, microwave etc.... There is no TV but I did not missed it.  There are 3 bedrooms and I noticed that 2 rooms are connected by the same balcony with  patio doors in each room.  Then, a family of 2 children can rent 2 rooms (one double beds and one with 2 simple beds).  There is a washing machine available also.  I highly recommend this place.  Tia responds to your emails instantly if questions or  problems."
22121376,348784646,2018-11-15,71696571,Tanzeen,"Vaki & Mike's place is amazing..way better than I expected and even better than the pics. Well thought through and has everything that you may need.

Cependant, nous avons été très déçus de la propreté: la salle de bain était rarement nettoyée (cheveux d’autres invités restés au sol ou dans la douche pendant plusieurs jours, taches, etc) et la poubelle de la salle de bain n’a pas été vidée pendant 2 jours, ce qui faisait en sorte que ça sentait mauvais dans la pièce. De plus, il n’y avait qu’un rouleau de papier de toilette par jour, pour 3 chambres: c’est vraiment insuffisant! De plus, nous n’en avons pas eu du tout pendant 2 jours, il a fallu s’en procurer par nous-mêmes!!! En ce qui concerne la chambre, elle était, pour sa part, conforme à l’annonce."

There’s an amazing mom and pop coffee shop called Coffee Break right on the corner. I recommend getting a cab getting there for the first time (the entrance is tucked between a break shop and a bike shop) because I know I wouldn’t have found the place by myself. Checking in was a breeze, much easier than anticipated. Everything really was great"

22123039,259912581,2018-05-03,49926163,Vikram,"Dimi was a pleasant host. The communication was very easy and he was able to help us with anything. He did offer us information beforehand and also stayed in touch during the stay.<br/><br/>The apartment is recently renovated and looks very nice and modern. <br/>It is quiet, and has a lot of sun. We were also able to use the washing machine.<br/><br/>We had a great stay and would recommend Dimi to anyone staying in Athen for a couple days. The apartment is perfect for a couple."
22123039,262762678,2018-05-10,62376817,Yu Ling,Dimi’s apartment is very nice and clean.Very close to the supermarket and five minutes walk to Metro. There’s also many small boutique along on the street.I will recommend the apartment very much
22123039,264530678,2018-05-14,38164859,Maarten,"Das Apartment ist super sauber, sehr modern und hell. Die Lage hat und sehr gut gefallen. In der Nachbarschaft ist ein Supermarkt, ein Bäcker (Bread), ein Pub, eine gute Pizzeria, viele Bars und auch sehr gute Restaurants. Wer modern, mediterran, griechisch essen gehen möchte sollte unbedingt zu tomauro provato (vorher reservieren). Ansonsten ist alles auch gut zu Fuß zu erkunden und fast schneller als mit der UBahn. Der Balkon ist ausreichend um frische Luft hereinzulassen, aber mehr auch nicht, da der Blick in den Innenhof und direkt zu den Nachbarn geht. Wir würden aber jederzeit wieder buchen. Danke für den tollen Aufenthalt!"

We would happily stay there again and were sad to leave. They went above and beyond as hosts to ensure we were comfortable. You can’t go wrong staying here, either one person or a couple. "
22123039,269307780,2018-05-27,1203977,Lorens,exactamente la promesa del servicio: genial!
22123039,270468133,2018-05-29,58773262,Adair,Dimi is a wonderful host and his place is in an awesome location - close to restaurants and a short walk to syntagma square and the Plaka area. He was very hospitable with lots of travel tips! 
22123039,271099838,2018-05-31,62023264,George,Best place to stay in Athens! Super clean and fantastic location!! Very quick responses and always willing to help! Will definitely stay there again!!!!
22123039,271729044,2018-06-02,33533530,Eric,Staying here was a great experience for two nights in Athens. Dimi was very helpful in recommending places to eat and got us a car at a very early hour of the morning which was much appreciated. Would recommend to anyone staying in Athens.
22123039,272818783,2018-06-04,53947215,Hemanth,Dimi was so helpful. He is such a great host. Place is beautiful
22123039,273447804,2018-06-06,150806858,Paolo,"Dimi's place is a really clean and cozy house. The house is perfect for a couple who wants to stay some days in a neighborhood near to metro and 30 minutes walk from Acropolis, but with a lot of bar and restaurants. Dimi is really nice and helpfu"
22123039,274472546,2018-06-09,2430389,María Daniela,"This place is located in the best area ever to stay in Athens, in my opinion. It’s quiet and surrounded by wonderful restaurants and very easy to access the most touristic spots and the airport. The environment is also great! The only contra: if you don’t like air conditioning, in summer the studio can get insanely hot and with one window open it’s not enough to get any fresh air not even during night. The sun heats up the whole studio during the afternoon and the evening and without the air conditioning on you can hardly survive there... other than that I still recommend it 100%, we had a great time there!"
22123039,275918762,2018-06-12,187444738,Mickael,"Petit appartement cocooning où l’on se sent parfaitement bien ! Une déco moderne qui a été réalisé avec goût ! Chaque détail apporte une touche supplémentaire. Quartier idéalement situé près du stade olympique et à 15 min a pied de tous les monuments incontournables ! Il est près du jardin national ainsi que du centre ville, aussi, nous nous déplaçons facilement à pied. Dimi est un hôte très gentil et disponible, parlant également le français c’est un plus ! Un rapport qualité/prix non négligeable !!! Je le conseille sans hésiter."

While it is a studio apartment, it has everything you need - even a USB charging area if you forget to buy an adapter for Europe! It’s those extra touches that people notice and it was very thoughtful. The shower was awesome and everything was styled beautifully. <br/><br/>We loved how central the apartment was to the centre of the city. We walked everywhere and hardly used the metro (that’s close by too), because everything was so central and it was enjoyable to walk and see Athens. Also, eateries were everywhere in the neighbourhood and we thank Dimi for his fabulous suggestions for places to go. Thanks Dimi and Luca!"
22123039,285187624,2018-07-03,6166906,Nicolette,"This flat was perfect for our two night stay in Athens.

We didn’t need the metro, we found the location perfect and walkable to everything. Thank you Dimi!"

22123039,298996007,2018-07-30,741270,Alexander,"This is the place you want to spend time in while in Athens.<br/><br/>Every detail was included when I arrived, and Dimi's assistant Spyro checked me into the space in a friendly and informative manner.  This is Greek hospitality at its best!  <br/><br/>The studio was immaculate upon arrival, and the space is bright, open, and exactly what I needed for my four-day trip in Athens.  <br/><br/>I was a short walk to the Evangelismos metro stop, giving me access to the entire city.  Trendy Kolonaki is just past the Evangelismos stop, and I took the train to Glyfada a couple days--I made it there (and back) in roughly 30-40 minutes by public transit (much shorter if going by car).<br/><br/>I was quite happy with this studio--I'm sure future travelers will be as well!"
22123039,304710394,2018-08-10,66123530,Chase,"Just what we expected, great place to spend our time in Athens. Thankful for the AC and the elevator! It made the hot August days much more bearable."

You don't need to spend money at fancy restaurants in touristic area. Santa Lucia is our favorite. Please try linguine with shrimp. 
22123039,318727714,2018-09-04,21162368,Katharina,We had a very nice stay in Dimi‘s appartement. There is everything you need (and more). Beautifully renovated Appartement and Dimi gave some helpful recommendations :) A ++++

22123039,328377822,2018-09-26,28451784,Eleni,"The space is new, stylish and superclean.<br/>As it is quite small it would be fine with overnight luggage, but nowhere to put large pieces.<br/>Lovely bathroom and a very comfortable sleep.<br/>It does face an unoccupied block which is unsightly, so not pleasant to sit on the balcony.<br/>Apart from the minor quibbles we had a lovely stay and location is great."
22123039,330917873,2018-10-01,207159258,Yuwei 薇薇,"If you are looking for a cozy, clean, modern and minimalistic designed apartment in Athens, this is the one! You have everything you need: towls, fresh bed linen, iron, hairdryer etc. <br/><br/>The apartment is located one metro station away from Syntagma Square (city center) and it takes you 5 minutes by foot to experience the awesome greek restaurant called ""The Black Sheep"" - a must! A supermarket and a bakery is located nearby (3 minutes walk). If you are sensible to noises, you might need earplugs during night - the apartment is poorly  soundproofed. But mostly, it is very quiet around the building. :) <br/><br/>Overall I could totally recommend this place!"

22123039,343588145,2018-11-01,44870431,Evagelos,"To keep it short and sweet:<br/>Value - 11/10.   Why?<br/>- Spotlessly clean<br/>- 5☆ room amenities<br/>- Centrally located<br/>- Pagrati is a safe neighbourhood<br/>- The appartment has a secure door<br/>- 1st class design features and furnishes<br/>- Dimi is a friendly, professional host<br/>- Great space for couples (+1 infant)<br/><br/>I honestly doubt there is anything better at this price point."

Καθαριότητα και άνεση σε υψηλότατο βαθμό. Στα αρνητικά της τοποθεσίας η μεγάλη ανηφόρα για να βγεις στην κεντρική οδό και η ελλειμματική προσβασιμότητα στο δωμάτιο, όπου διέρχεσαι από σχεδόν 10 σκαλοπάτια για να φτάσεις στο ασανσέρ με τις βαλίτσες."

Το διαμέρισμα ήταν απολύτως ήσυχο και πολύ φωτεινό παρότι είχε συννεφιά τις μέρες της διαμονής μου.<br/>Η διακόσμηση όμορφη και ζεστή, με ιδιαίτερους “επαίνους” στο ξύλινο πάτωμα που επεκτείνεται ακόμα και μέσα στο μπάνιο (επίσης πολύ φωτεινό!). Όλο το διαμέρισμα έχει διαμορφωθεί εργονομικά ώστε ο επισκέπτης να μη δυσκολεύεται με τους χώρους ή τη χρήση του εξοπλισμού. Επίσης η πόρτα ήταν ασφαλείας κι έτσι δε δυσκολεύτηκα να νιώσω άνετα. <br/>Ήταν ωραίο να δραστηριοποιούμε μέσα στη χαοτική Αθήνα, γνωρίζοντας πως αργότερα με περιμένει ένα απόλυτα φιλόξενο σπίτι!<br/>p.s.

22123039,452848037,2019-05-14,250589425,Alena,This was a stylish apartment in an okay part of town. It was ideally located for walking to the different places we wanted to visit in Athens. Really appreciated all the local tips Dimi David gave us. He was also super helpful and thoughtful in setting up a driver from the airport when we arrived and was flexible with a really late check in.
22123039,465698522,2019-06-08,29783808,Jos,"Apartment is exactly as in the pictures. Wifi is good. Location very close to supermarketl, bakery and to metro. Would stay here again!"

However within the adjacent flat, there is a very loud dog who appears to be left alone most days and therefore barks non stop all day - sometimes we heard it until midnight! Other than that the flat was perfect and as described."
22123039,482944057,2019-07-07,50962580,Diala,"Nice and stylish interior, also convenient design and layout for a small studio, feels spacious. <br/>My stay here was in a second part of my trip in Athens so my focus wasn’t on the touristic center (although there’s easy access to it), the neighborhood is lined with nice cafes, bars and restaurants which turns into an alive, yet not noisy, night scene. <br/>Dimi and Luca were very responsive and very helpful. Assisted me in keeping my luggage for the day as well. <br/>It was considerate and nice touch to stack extra towels, leave the outside light on for a later check in, placed a wash pod in the washer for first use, coffee capsules and bottle of water in the fridge for a very hot day!<br/>Would definitely stay here again."
22123039,487644372,2019-07-14,59253745,Erika,"Great place within walking distance to all of Athens! Dimi did a great job as a host as well. He sends out videos of the check-in process which is beyond helpful when you are new the city. The place was clean, comfortable and felt like home. The neighborhood is also great. You get the feel of the local vibe and for me, it was great to get away from all of the touristy crowds. With that said, I walked everywhere and it was super easy to get to all of the major attractions. Wifi was strong. The bed was comfortable. It was just a super easy stay. Loved it!"

Everything was well cleaned and thought of. The bathroom was in pristine condition and the a/c a lifesaver. Communication was great, so overall I'd definitely recommend the place. Thanks Dimi!"

22123039,534783181,2019-09-23,117980653,Karen,"The place is clean and just like it is shown in the pictures -- clean, quiet, and cozy; just don't expect a view from the balcony. The self check-in was the easiest I've experienced, and Dimi's team arranged a private transfer from the airport, which was helpful as my flight arrived quite late. The street is rather dark at night, but the building entrance is lit up well. Also, it's just around the corner from some of the best restaurants/cafes in the area, so I felt quite safe even coming back late at night. Dimi's team provided everything I needed as a solo traveller for my 3-night stay. It is near enough to walk to the city centre, but they also gave information about public transportation if you want to take that instead. I also appreciated the restaurant/cafe recommendations. I could grab a great brunch, go out for a day of sightseeing, and come back again to good food right near the apartment. Overall, it was the perfect base for my weekend trip, and I had a great stay."
22123039,537925725,2019-09-29,217611974,Tamsin,"This place is exactly how it looks in the pictures. Perfect for solo travellers or couples, across the street from a supermarket and less than 10 minutes from the metro! Nice building and neighbourhood too! Plenty of thoughtful touches (coffee pod, bottle of water in the fridge). I would absolutely stay here again when I come back to Athens!"

Although the place was very clean, comfortable for two people!"

The location is really convenient and in the centre of Athens. The nearest underground station is just 7 minutes walk, giving great access to the rest of Athens. I paid 25 euros per night and it totally worth it. I would absolutely book again without a second thought for the same price"

22134247,234266402,2018-02-12,45724143,Laertis,"Dimitris is an amazing host. Also the location is perfect. Only 1-2 min from the Metro station. The only ""disadvantage"" is that the room is just in front of a school so it is noisy and was difficult to relax or to take a nap during the school hours. Everythink else is good. <br/>Thank you Dimitris for hosting me."
22134247,235263525,2018-02-16,48322636,Vadim,I advise the housing of Dimitrios. excellent relation price/quality. 4 metro stations from the central square Monastiraki (nearly 10-15 minutes). Owner knows english and russian.<br/>Very good!

22134247,239535434,2018-03-02,91843040,Chloe,Très bon rapport qualité prix ! une chambre tout a fait convenable (simple mais propre) pour un prix très peu élevé. Situé à 2-3 arrêts de métro de l'extra centre et des quartiers vivants. <br/>RAS pour un logement vraiment pas chère c'est très correct !<br/>+ réactivité et Dimitrios est très arrangeant et sympa! <br/>je recommande
22134247,240535529,2018-03-05,156768911,Gabriel,El lugar está muy bien. Solo un poco alejado de acrópolis. Pero el metro muy cerca. Totalmente recomendable!!!
22134247,242777013,2018-03-13,146420788,Maxime,"dimitrios est patient et à l'écoute. le logement à 3 stations de métro du centre. le retour à pied se fait aisément. commodités à proximité (300m max: point de retrait, supermarché, épiceries de nuit, tabac, poste, métro... kebab? :-)  ) une bonne expérience que je recommande et renouvellerais peut-être."

22134247,245176065,2018-03-21,49620471,Milan,"Cheap at all, but not only the price. Anyway:<br/><br/>+ Really good price,  situated in side street (not main road), accurately on pedestrian zone, so no huge traffic noise (Athens are unbelievably full of cars).<br/><br/>- Old and neglected (doors, bathroom, bed, windows...), dirty bathroom (unfortunately not cleaned up before we arrived, so I did quickly on my own).<br/><br/>Locality is wide centre, but to the historical downtown is not close to (Athens is really huge city).<br/><br/>There is a primary school building playground, so it is noisy after 8am, especially during their breaks, but still better than car traffic."

22134247,247939091,2018-03-30,74358118,Lautaro,"El departamento es tal cual como se ve en las fotos. Sencillo y con todo lo necesario para una estadia agradable. Dispone de una cocina, con el equipamiento suficiente como para cocinar cosas sencillas. El barrio es muy tipico de Atenas, muy seguro y con mucho movimiento pero muy tranquilo. Se llega al centro de la ciudad en no mas de 10minutos ya que la estacion mas proxima se encuentra a 400metros aproximadamente y debido a que es una estacion de superficie es muy rapido trasladarse.<br/> Enfrente hay una escuela que le da mucha vida al barrio.  A su vez, bares, restaurantes y muchas panaderias se encuentran facilmente.<br/>Dimitros fue muy agradable y estuvimos en contacto durante todo el viaje y compartimos algunas salidas. Recomiendo alojarse en su departamento."
22134247,249867027,2018-04-03,33945781,Carmelle,We spent one night here. Dimitrios is very nice and was able to be very flexible with us. Recommend for anyone looking for a cheep place to stay!
22134247,252051955,2018-04-09,20144023,Dorothy,"We really enjoyed our stay at Dimitrios place. The room was clean with a comfortable bed, two big wardrobes for storage and a nice balcony. The area was more residential and local, and just 3 minutes away from the train station, which brought you to the center in about 10 minutes. Dimitrios was a really cool guy with interesting stories who showed us around, gave us tips and went out for beers with us.  Definitely recommend this place!"

Die Unterkunft ist nur ca. 100 m von der Metro entfernt und daher sehr leicht erreichbar. Sie ist einfach, aber zweckmäßig ausgestattet und sehr sauber. Auch Lokale, Bäckereien und ein Supermarkt befinden sich in unmittelbarer Nähe."
22134247,281624022,2018-06-25,6158220,Jacq,"Thank you Dimitrios and Katrina.  Communication and picking up keys was super were easy. The place is lovely, very quiet, and though its out of the main centre, as one would expect for such a low price, it is super close to the Metro and great value for money. As you say, it's on a very convenient line and only 10 mins from the centre. The room, so spacious, light and airy, with french doors onto a balcony, was better than I anticipated."

There are many shops and cafes and restaurants walking distance from this place. Katerina (who is a co-host with Dimitrios) was very kind and picked me up from the bus station and took me to the bazaar for grocery shopping and then helped explain how to get around the city which was really appreciated as this was my first time in Greece. Overall, the amenities were great, clean and functional. And big plus was the quick responses on the parts of the hosts. Thanks Dimitrios and Katerina for everything, we really enjoyed our stay!"

The room we stayed in was very clean, as were the bed sheets and towels we got. Using the shower may be a bit tricky, but we shower cold in the summer, so no issue there. Even if you want a hot shower you just need to remember one thing and that's it, so no issue at all. We stayed our first day in a more expensive apartment in exarchia and by comparison, this is much much much better. We enjoyed our stay here"

Kitchen is sparse (only one poorly working hot plate, no chopping board etc.), so wouldn’t plan on doing any proper cooking. Close to the subway and easily accessible from the main train station. Be aware that this is an Airbnb apartment, so there is one other room which is being rented on Airbnb and no on-site host. Communication is somewhat confusing as you’re communicating with 3 co-hosts.

22134247,331243779,2018-10-02,24036321,Hannah,"Nice room for a good price close to public transport options! 5-10 minutes walking to the direct airport bus (X93) and 3 minutes to the metro. Not many cooking utensils available (only one electric plate), so better for a short stay then for a long one :)"
22134247,331605792,2018-10-03,175168834,AcroCenter Plus,Thank you very much!
22134247,332378950,2018-10-05,191581942,Femke,A nice stay and a good host
22134247,332788814,2018-10-06,65756029,Samantha,Our second time at Dimitrios!  Another great stay.  Dimitrios is very kind and helpful.  We spent extra time with him as he brought my friend and I on a guided half day hiking trip. He is adventurous and full of knowledge!  Check out Suzanna 's cafe on the corner for amazing crêpes! !!
22134247,334778387,2018-10-10,90659112,Дмитрий,"Жильё находится в отличном месте, рядом метро и остановка автобуса с аэропорта X93. Район рядом с домом конечно,так себе, не для прогулок, лучше сразу ехать в центр. Хозяин учтивый и открытый к гостям. Рекомендуется"
22134247,336975942,2018-10-15,74932058,Libertad,"Der Gastgeber ist eine sehr nette Person, offen für Fragen und hilft gerne. Leider war das Bett die reinste Katastrophe, da wir überhaupt nicht in unseren Urlaub schlafen konnten. Es quietschte bei jeder Bewerbung und es hat einfach nur noch mehr Schaden am Rücken gemacht als das man darauf entspannen konnte. Sonst konnte man für den Preis nichts besseres erwarten, klar muss man sich damit zufrieden stellen, das dass Bad schon etwas älter ist."
22134247,338253123,2018-10-19,88860083,Arist,"Πολύ καλή εξυπηρέτηση, το δωμάτιο είναι όπως στις φωτογραφίες, κανένα παράπονο."
22134247,340239660,2018-10-23,37288201,Marta,"Dimitrios was a very friendly host and provided us with everything we needed. The room was good value for money and we were happy with the stay. The only disadvantage was the closeness to the bathroom which we shared with people staying over in the other room. In our room we could hear every noise from there, especially at night. Otherwise we had no objections and we recommend the place :)"
22134247,340472876,2018-10-24,128554479,Nils,"Had a nice stay at Dimitrios place! Polite, helpful and responsible host who generously shared great knowledge of the city and neighborhood. Nice and comfortable apartment in a central area of Athens for a very good price."

22134247,345453884,2018-11-05,216015525,Bálint,"The place of Dimitrios is a great place with the best location (near the bus station to Delphi and the metro). However the room has a window to a school, which is not a problem during the summer or weekend but for us it was hard to get a long sleep with children shouting outside our windows. All in all it's a great value for the price. Thanks a lot!"
22134247,345854259,2018-11-06,65856224,Seiko,Good place. There was no hot water works during my stay (cold in nov. ) but they tryed to repair in the morning.
22134247,346055932,2018-11-07,192526306,Muktai,"Good place with basic amenities! Especially, for one night, it was perfect! All the three hosts are responsive and hospitable. I recommend this place."

22134247,353690813,2018-11-29,160127202,Eloise,"Dimitrios was a great host, he met up with us and showed us to the appartment, he gave us a lot of tips and ideas for things to do around Athens, he even went out with us and showed us some cool places.<br/><br/>The apartment was perfect for us, clean, great balcony, so close to the train station and supermarkets, it was very easy for us to get anywhere from his place. Would definitely recommend this apartment for other travellers."

22134247,400802296,2019-01-13,129483652,Dimitris,"Second time for me staying at this flat. It was a great experience once again, with an excellent location close to the metro, city-center, and above all it is economically priced. Dimitrios answers very quickly and always makes sure to put the visitors first. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Athens any time during the year."
22134247,401620915,2019-01-15,101240179,Αντώνης,"Εξαιρετική τοποθεσία της κατοικίας 1 λεπτό απ τ μετρό και μεσα στ κέντρο. Το σχολείο που βρίσκεται ακριβώς απέναντι και η απουσία ηχομονωσης δεν ευνοεί τους ταξιδιώτες που εξερευνούν την βραδινή ζωη της Αθήνας. Καθαροτατο, φιλόξενο δωμάτιο κατάλληλο για διαμονή ολίγων ημερών. Πολυ φιλόξενος και κατατοπιστικός ο κύριος Δημήτρης και πάντα πρόθυμος να μας εξυπηρετήσει οποιαδήποτε στιγμή."

It's close to public transport but also only a 40 minute walk into town. Although we didn't get to meet Dimitrios in person, his check-in instructions were clear and easy to follow."
22134247,420258259,2019-03-06,82656227,Luc,"good place,not far from metro,good caffee downstairs,for a quik bite or coffee."

22134247,432205988,2019-04-03,64736230,Tom,"Does what it says on the tin, fair bang for your buck. Not quite cheap as chips but the host goes the extra mile supplying a thorough guide to the area and checking in, leaving no stone unturned. With a throw from the same stone one can reach the metro station, and the city's your oyster. Leaves nothing wanting, but keeps you coming back for seconds.<br/>Chuffed to bits,<br/>Yours Faithfully,<br/>And Sincerely,<br/>Two English Wurdsmiths"
22134247,433265228,2019-04-06,133137506,Ewa,"Very good location (5 min to metro station and pretty close to city center), exellent communication with a host. I recommend it."
22134247,437065015,2019-04-14,109796908,Nguyen,The place is as described.  Cheap rent and great location. You can use the train station which is just 1-200m from the apartment to go almost anywhere in Athens. I did not meet Dimitrios but the communication was effective and quick. I recommend.
22134247,437838413,2019-04-15,247600605,Cybil,"Super chambre, le check in au top, une réactivité géniale ! Un seul petit bémol, la chambre qui donne sur la rue n'est pas très calme (école en face)."
22134247,440073588,2019-04-20,56007921,Serj,"This is really good flat in calm Athens disrict. Staying here is best way to feel Athens like a local. Flat looks used but quite clean and nice. Close to it you will find a few grocery and bakery stores, print center, post, metro and bus station (7min walk)"
22134247,442272241,2019-04-23,19072321,Kabin,The place was very easy to locate and I managed to get there just with the comprehensive guide provided by Dimitrios. Even at 3am there was a bus from the airport to a bus stop very near this place. And it’s walking distance to the train station as well. George went out of his way to provide assistance when I needed it. Very thankful for this place.
22134247,445329195,2019-04-29,121176632,Romane,Very cool place and localisation. Dimitrios is a very helpfull host! What a pleasur to breakfast on his balcony with the morning Greece sun! ☀️
22134247,447775675,2019-05-04,141252051,Olivia,"The place is very well situated, far enough from the big crowds of the city and very accessible by bus and by train. All you need is near by, and the neighbourhood is very friendly. Overall a great place!"
22134247,451092978,2019-05-11,24437821,Nico,"Easy arriving, handling and a very nice room."
22134247,451826710,2019-05-12,24369594,Camille,"We recommend this room. At our arrival his lovely friend greeted us and made us feel at home. It is a little bit far away from the center bit, for the good walkers it can take about 45 minutes, for the others the metro is right by. It is kind of close to the train station going to the meteoras."
22134247,454366969,2019-05-18,44849147,Sebastian,It's the best you will find for this price in Athens. Straight-forward way to metro which will take you to most of the tourist sights in minutes.
22134247,454958253,2019-05-19,27936715,William,Really smooth checking in and out of Dimotrios' place. Excellent communications. The apartment has everything you need. The room is very comfortable and clean. Lovely little balcony overlooking the neighbourhood. Highly recommended!
22134247,458613990,2019-05-26,34830565,Víctor,"We stayed here for one week and it was the best choice we've done. The apartment is in a perfect location, 4 or 5 metro stops to the city centre, and it has everything you need. Dimitrios always was willing to answer our questions! I'd book here again when I come back yo Athens!"
22134247,459945325,2019-05-28,128226336,Emma,"Super chambre, tres propre avec petit balcon, salle de bain partagée propre aussi ! Je recommande !"

I like my room has a little balcony that you can actually sit there and relax. Kitchen is small but you can cook basic meals without problem. <br/>I didn’t meet Dimitrios in person but he was super helpful and responsive."

22134247,471311391,2019-06-17,60350345,Daniela,"El piso cuenta con muchos aspectos buenos que lo hacen un buen alojamiento  para pasar uno, dos o tres días como mucho. El anfitrión deja muy claro en todo momento como llegar o emplear los distintos espacios de la vivienda. <br/><br/>El barrio se encuentra a 8 minutos del centro en metro y hay una parada muy cercana (2-3 min). También cuenta con una estación de buses de KTEL muy cercana. De todo ello, lo peor fue el ruido, ya que es un primero muy cercano a la calle y se escucha absolutamente todo.<br/><br/>La habitación estaba limpia y proporciona toallas y ropa de cama. Lo peor sin duda alguna fue la cocina. No tiene un fuego o vitrocerámica en condiciones para poder cocinar, de ahí que dificulte estancias más largas en la vivienda (la nuestra fue de 7 días). Fuere o no por calor o temporada, encontramos cucarachas en la cocina y en el baño, junto a otros insectos, como arañas. <br/><br/>No obstante, el trato mantenido con el anfitrión por vía telefónica siempre ha sido claro y conciso. Como vivienda para un corto plazo está bien."
22134247,476346052,2019-06-26,59178383,Anna,"Our quick stay in the room was really welcoming and Dimitrios made it for us totally uncomplicated. We could even stay over the check out time, which helped us a lot! I highly recommend the location - it's very close to everything you want to reach"
22134247,477434802,2019-06-28,36374048,Eva,"Great location, right next to a good coffee shop and metro station! It’s not so touristic so I felt like I was a part of local life. Dimitrios was always very helpful and fast with his replies! The flat was really clean and I enjoyed the vibes of it. I didn’t expect it to be that nice and comfy for such a good price! I recommend very much!"
22134247,478521926,2019-06-30,168609653,Jeanne,"The flat is very well located, only 2 minutes to get to the station. And only 20 minutes from Acropolis. Dimitrio is very helpful and answer very quickly!<br/>Strongly recommend it!"
22134247,482887262,2019-07-07,253592261,Ilenia,"Dimitrios house is very nice and comfortable. The location is great cause the place is super close to the metro, to some markets and also some restaurants. Our room was clean and bright, the rest of the house was nice and clean too. Unfortunately he couldn’t be there for the check in but he gave us all the self check in instruction which were very detailed so we had no problems! We really enjoyed our stay there!!"
22134247,486192827,2019-07-12,256691073,Miklós,"Dimitrios flat was really good and it's very well located. The metro is very close and there are several cafes, restaruants, pubs, bakeries and supermarkets in the neighbourhood. Unfortunately we haven't met with Dimitrios in person, but he was very helpful and kind, he always wrote back immediately. If you would like to stay a couple days in Athens and you want a really good accomodation in a good price, you should definitely choose this one! We can absolutely recommend it!(:"
22134247,486688127,2019-07-13,163880727,Louis,Awesome place to stay! Really close to the train and in a great location overall :)

22134247,491489286,2019-07-20,236283835,Cristina,Great place to stay in Athens! Very close to the train station. Very close to main attractions in town as well.
22134247,494397576,2019-07-24,21695291,Soledad,"No tuve ningún problema. Llegamos demasiado temprano a Atenas y aunque el check in era más tarde, Dimitrios no tuvo ningún inconveniente en  que dejáramos  el equipaje en la habitacion sin problemas. Cuando llegamos al portal, ya nos estaba esperando! <br/>La habitación es igual que en la foto. Como se describe. No hay sorpresas. Tiene una pequeña terraza que me vino genial para fumar. No utilizamos la cocina porque estuvimos muy poco tiempo y la verdad es que comer en Atenas es bastante económico, así que ni la usamos. Lo recomiendo porque la verdad es que por el precio está muy bien, cerquita del centro y el metro  muy cerca de la casa. Muchas gracias Dimitrios!"
22134247,509930835,2019-08-15,159690254,Rebecca,"Athens<br/>The stay at Dimitrios apartment was good. Everything was as expected and good value for money. Dimitrios was also very helpful , responding to any queries promptly and he explains everything you need to know in detail on his Airbnb page. <br/>However just a few small things I feel need to be mentioned. In the apartment, there is a very small fridge, which I don't think is enough, especially considering there were 4 people in the apartment during our stay. So there was little room to store even basic things like milk. <br/>Secondly, before I booked the apartment, I had read some reviews saying that the neighborhood was ""great"" and ""lively"". Personally, and speaking on my partner's behalf we didn't experience this and there were times, especially at night, where we felt uneasy. <br/>Other than that we had a pleasant stay. Thank you Dimitrios."
22134247,513259704,2019-08-19,78438055,Benjamin,"Dimitrios is a great responsive host with a stylish, clean and comfortable apartment in a great location. We slept well every night, had good (Hidden by Airbnb) and generally loved our stay!"

22134247,514488653,2019-08-21,201573512,Sophie,Very nice apartment! The self check in was very easy going and everything was explained very detailed on his website. It is central and you are good connected (train station is only a few meters away) also a supermarket is close by. We enjoyed our stay and recommend it ❤️ have a nice time in Athens
22134247,514911446,2019-08-22,9988200,Jérémy,"Le logement de Dimitrios est parfaitement conforme à son annonce, la communication avec lui était parfaite et la proximité avec une station de métro très pratique. Je vous conseille son logement."
22134247,535421458,2019-09-24,46073196,Ellie,"We stayed at Dimitrios place for two weeks and it was perfect for us! It really felt like a safe, comfortable place to call home. The location is really amazing with the train just steps away to take you downtown in less than 20 mins. The balcony was a highlight, we spent most mornings and evenings there enjoying coffee. Dimitrios was always very quick to respond with any questions or concerns and as always very helpful and accommodating. A great value for a great place in really a prime location. Also! You must go to Cafe Souzana downstairs, she is so sweet and their coffee frappes are *muah* We loved it and would gladly return. Until next time, Athens!"
22134247,536215157,2019-09-26,217628738,Nargiz,"Dimitrios is a great host ! He is kind, friendly, and responded our messages very quickly and did his best to make us feel comfortable and helped with local tips. The flat is very close to metro station, our room was clean and cosy. My friend and I enjoyed our stay at Dimitrios place and we recommend him as a host to people who plan travel to Athens."
22134247,537103829,2019-09-28,189906869,Rashee,"Dimitrios was so kind and helpful. He responded quickly everytime we messaged him to ask something. Place was very near to metro. Just don't waste money on cab take metro from airport or port to reach this place! Nearest metro station is Aghios Nikolaos. Great hospitality, value for money."

22134247,592555575,2020-01-13,257273133,Tom,Dimitrios was a fantastic host. The room was clean and comfortable and he offered plenty of helpful tips as a first timer to Greece.
22134247,593186159,2020-01-15,37652496,Benjamin,Dimitrios was extremly helpful during my stay in Athens. He explained everything in Detail so that i could not miss out anything. The place was also very clean and in a central location of Athens. Would definetly recommend stayingat his place if you visit Athens.
22134247,594699123,2020-01-19,131665363,Themis,It's ok for the price
22134247,597280438,2020-01-25,123390299,Lu,"my stay has been good. the host is really friendly and responses very quick. the location of the room is very nearby the metro station and there is cafeteria and supermarket just downstairs which is very convenient. just because of the winter,the flat has been very cold even i let the heater on,and the hot water lasts very short which i think it's something should be improved as it's very cold in winter and we need hot water bath to survive instead of taking a jail style shower. thanks to Dimitrios very much anyway!"
22134247,600240672,2020-02-01,119152891,Vira,"Житло в точності відповідає описаному. Поруч зі станцією метро. Дякуючи хазяїну та його чітким інструкціям добирання до квартири було легким та успішним, навіть незважаючи, що ми прилетіли близько дванадцятої ночі. Автобуси ходять цілодобово, і зупинка поруч, в пішій доступності (10 хв., навіть з читанням табличок вулиці та номерів будинків). Кімната з виглядом на школу, що чудово, можна було не користуватися будильником і прокидатися під шкільний дзвоник (при бажанні можна було і не прокидатися). В січні (в день +15, вночі +7) центральне опалення не працювало, ми включали електричну батарею, правда за ніч кімната повністю не обігрівалася і було прохолодно. Думаю, влітку це чудовий варіант:) Кухня та санвузол в хорошому стані. Так як все на електриці, потрібно було слідкувати, щоб не перенавантажувати електромережу, і поступово включати обігрів води (достатньо 20 хв.), батарею, електроплиту. <br/>Дякую,  Dimitrios, за гостинність :)))"
22134247,620839964,2020-03-25,248959635,David,Great stay! Owner was quick to respond. Booked very last minute without any problems. Provided lots of useful information upon booking. Have to take a train to get to most places but the station is super close. I would definitely stay here again!

I took it in a last minute and it was a fare quality price. I could work there a few hours a day and take the train to go to the city center at night. Is a safe area to stay, there’s a coffee next door and groceries stores close by too. Thanks for everything!"

Мы жили в комнате весь ноябрь, когда в Афинах был локдаун. Квартира находится близко к метро, очень удобно добираться в центр, рядом много магазинов. Прямо под окнами находится Кафе Сюзанна с очень вкусными панкейками и школа. <br/>По утрам, когда школа работает, довольно шумно. На кухне есть одна сковородка и кастрюля, можно что-то минимально приготовить. <br/><br/>К сожалению, роутер находится у входа, поэтому вайфай в комнате работает очень слабо. В самой комнате было прохладно, даже когда включаешь обогреватель.  <br/><br/>Если вы едете путешествовать и остаться ненадолго, отличное жильё за низкую цену!"

I would comment only for the bathroom and shower which were very small and hot water was not so enough for a long shower. The balcony was wonderful for a relaxing coffee at any time of the day. Safe and secure area, not so quite though because of the traffic, around 15 to 20 minutes walking distance to metro (streets with up and down hills!). I would definitely recommend this place for any future travellers. Thanks!"

I could reach out to them via phone and email all the time - they were always super responsive and helpful. The apartment is super clean and also very calm - I wasn´t able to hear the other guests at all. All amenities provided you need for a stay at Athens. Would absolutely recommend this apartment for your stay in Athens!

22143442,261191236,2018-05-06,148481221,Edmund,"Pictures and description were accurate. I was looking for a place to sleep for 2 nights on a budget, with a clean room, clean bed, clean bathroom, warm shower and clean towels, and this apartment provided exactly that. Air conditioning and WiFi were working well. The apartment is near a main road, so some people may find it to be a bit noisy, but it also means that the area is safe. Personally, I think the noise wasn't that bad at all. The apartment is also only about 10 mins walk to the Acropolis or to Syntagma, so it is really quite cheap considering the good location. Lastly, the hosts were very professional in their communications, and they were thoughtful enough to provide a free map and guide of Athens and even a little souvenir to take home :)"
22143442,265706077,2018-05-18,59781122,Annie,"Great place. The tram is right outside, subway (and Acropolis site) is a 7 min walk. Perfect accommodation if you don't plan on staying in the room all day. A bit far from a grocery store but so close to all the major attractions which makes up for it. Nothing lavish, but very nice and everything you need."

Also there is no hot tub which is in the description as well. <br/><br/>The location is great, only about 10 minutes from Syntagma Square where you can find shops, cafès and restaurants.<br/>One aspect I personally didn’t enjoy was the noise in the room since it’s located right next to a busy main street. <br/><br/>The hosts weren’t there but always kept in touch very well via the airbnb website.<br/>The self - check in with the code & lock box is easy and very convenient. There is only 1 key in the lockbox so you always need to put it back but when you approach the door of your room you’ll find your own keys which is great!"

There are a lot of conveniences that save you from bringing everything. There are also plenty of small shops close by to buy anything you might need. I felt safe all the time. The tram is super close which is great and I didn't find the noise bothersome at all. The neighbors are quiet too. There is also a nice garden area to relax in.

My wife and I were to arrive at the Athens airport passed midnight, so were little worried about the check in. But as soon as we contacted Theodore, he assured me and helped me reserve the nicest taxi I have met in Athens, and waited for us at the house until we arrived. Then he gave me good tips only locals could give me so that I can better enjoy the city!  The house is also very clean and pleasant to stay! Located near the city center, we could come back to house sometime to rest before going to dinner.  Highly recommend this place!"

It was very stylish, and the apartment is very spacious.  The apartment is about a 30 min walk from Acropolis and Plaka which made it easy for us to walk & get around. Theodore really went above and beyond to make us comfortable and waited till past 2 am at the apartment until we arrived. The local tips provided helped make our trip as the restaurant and attraction recommendations were perfect. All in all a great stay. Thank you!"

Such a good example, of that how every host should do: welcome wine, lots of information, accurate tips and recomendation, perfect place for connection to Tram, Metro, buses. Many cafes and bakerys around, 3 mins with metro 2nd stop) from akropolis. You wonder if you want to stay here - you should. Thanks for great host!"
22144862,283140348,2018-06-29,2755502,Melanie,"We loved our week-long stay at Theodore's! We have a young baby, so the quiet and convenient location right on the ground floor was perfect! It is a very easy tram or metro ride to Syntagma, and the Acropolis is even closer. Theodore also could not have been a better host. He helped us with all of our transportation needs and even went the extra mile with a crib for our baby and fantastic travel tips. It was the perfect spot for us.<br/>The only negative thing that I would say is, because of the design of the apartment, the living room is in the kitchen, which doesn't leave much space for relaxing. That being said, it worked just fine for us. (And the tram noise is more of a rumble, which never woke us up at night or bothered our baby)"

Theo was quick to answer our last minute request and his mom Mary was absolutely too adorable when she greeted us. His home at Neos Cosmos is the hub of action, and apart from being well connected to everything, but the fresh market on Saturday is also a highlight and definitely not to be missed. Theo's place has everything for a relaxing Athens visit. The quiet garden terrace is beautiful decorated with plants and you find yourself staring up at the greenery over a wine often. We were woken up by a cat fighting with dogs once but if the small price you pay to live in a central location I consider that already good. The home itself is decorated in a shabby chic style, incorporating old furniture refurbished into new pop colors.  The bathroom was an absolute JOY to use. We place a lot of value into a good bathroom because it can make or break our holiday mood. We enjoyed the personal touches given to the decor and you can tell this is a home built with love and passion. On the day of checkout , as there was no guest coming in, Theo let us stay as long as we felt comfortable and was totally relaxed about it us keeping the key for collecting our luggage later. We enjoyed this place absolutely needless to say. It made our Athens trip so special and unique. See you and Mary one day again, Theo!"
22144862,326416665,2018-09-22,11413837,Niloy,"Theodore is an exceptional host and his place is very special. He met us when we arrived and talked with us for over an hour; sharing the do's and dont's of the city. He marked up a local map that we ended up using the entire time while we were in Athens. His introductory guide that includes many recommendations is spot on. The place is in, Neos Kosmos, and it's one minute away from both the metro and subway. <br/><br/>Very clean and comfortable place with plenty of space!"
22144862,331241527,2018-10-02,70168984,Ian,"Deffo an 11 out of 10 experience! Want to go to Athens? Then make sure you get Theodore's  beautiful place. The facilities are really great, the location is excellent and the host impeccable, kind friendly - really a superhost. Theodore was excellent in his help and advice but very respectful of our privacy etc. On a couple of occasions I messaged him with a question on local details - nothing to do with the flat, and he always answered immediately. Truly I can wholly recommend his facilities and him as a host."
22144862,333304494,2018-10-07,205739913,Gülcan,10 Numara! Perfect house owner and perfect house. Highly recommended. Location is also very good. Thank you Theadore..

22144862,366096521,2019-01-02,230431683,Timothy,Theodore was an outstanding host. He was very responsive at all points and met us at the location.   He helped us find a place to park the car which is often an issue.  His information about the area was also very helpful. Highly recommend his place.
22144862,368530643,2019-01-07,112359255,Aurélie,"L’appartement était tout à fait conforme à la description.  Théodore nous a accueillis chaleureusement en prenant le temps de nous expliquer Athènes, et il a gentiment accepté que nous retardions notre départ de quelques heures. Appartement très bien situé et très agréable à vivre. Je recommande!"
22144862,411372786,2019-02-12,236379970,Liz,"Theodore’s place is wonderful in every way! The location is amazing because it is not a long ways from the city center if you want to walk, but it is also close to public transportation if you’d rather. There is an amazing restaurant right next door and coffee shops a few steps away which make eating at anytime quick and convenient. Theodore offers so many incredible recommendations and is always available to answer all questions. Made my time in Athens feel right at home."
22144862,433812551,2019-04-07,148175140,Claudio,"You can’t ask for a better accommodation!The flat is exactly as pics show and located (Website hidden by Airbnb) just a short walking distance (less than 2 minutes) from Metro station Neos Kosmos, to start discovering the city.The Host Theodore is perfect:welcoming and flexible about check in/out, ready to help you every time you need and constantly in touch via (Hidden by Airbnb) to make it easier. Definitely a place to come back to when again in Athens!"

22144862,442691714,2019-04-24,229126947,Caoimhe,Amazing apartment! Theodore was always on hand if we needed anything and responded quickly. The apartment itself was beautifully decorated and we enjoyed sitting out on the patio in the evenings. Theodore left a bunch of recommendations for us too which didn’t disappoint and helped get a feel for Athens. Overall a wonderful stay!
22144862,447262420,2019-05-03,152358861,Alexander,"It was really cozy and well furnished, the location is a spot where locals live and eat. Many Coffee shops and a supermarket are close to the apartment and on the weekend there is a street market where you can get fruits, vegetables and daily stuff at a good price (local price, not tourist price).<br/>Theodore is a very good host, he was always attentive and would constantly check if everything was okay. He gave me some tips on how to move in the city.<br/>I am glad that I was a guest here."
22144862,450024367,2019-05-08,220570455,Susanne,"Theodore hat uns herzlich willkommen geheißen, mit zahlreichen Tipps zu Athen und Umgebung versorgt und war stets erreichbar. Die Wohnung ist sehr liebevoll gestaltet, alles, was man braucht ist vorhanden. Die Metro, die Straßenbahn, Supermärkte, Cafes sind in direkter Nachbarschaft. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen, vielen Dank an Theodore und Olga."
22144862,452425382,2019-05-13,50559026,Miluska,Our stay in Theodore’s place was fantastic! We had the most welcoming check in I had in my life. Theodore made us feel super welcome and looked after....he even prepared a booklet with guidelines like you find the hotels. Every detail of the flat was designed to delight people. The location is perfect to reach center of Athens by walking or by metro (stop is outside the door).  We loved having the Saturday market close by.  I would definitely recommend everyone to stay here and enjoy the trip as we did!
22144862,461676973,2019-06-01,171651621,Bruno,"Place was as good as previous reviews and pictures could tell.<br/>Theodore was very helpful, and gave us a very thorough information package about Athens. Replies to our questions were fast.<br/>I can recommend this apartment and host to everyone."
22144862,463445893,2019-06-03,40896582,Shannon,"Theodore was very kind and gave us so many excellent recommendations.  Check in was easy, no fuss at all. They provided us with free coffee which was thoughtful and nice. Very cute apartment with everything you need for a short stay. My only feedback is that the bedroom door has frosted glass so if someone is in the kitchen with the light on you’ll wake from the light, and the apartment sometimes vibrates from the underground train located beneath the apartment. Overall though, it’s good value for money!"
22144862,464209174,2019-06-05,255170502,Maria,Everything was more than perfect. Great location and the recommendations from Theo was outstanding.
22144862,465097354,2019-06-07,246103237,Nick,"Let’s let’s start with location. Live like an upscale local. There’s no upgrade from here. Off the tourist path, safe, with access to public transport 30 meters from the front door. Theo’s place is wonderful. Clean, nicely furnished. <br/><br/>Prior to coming, Theo sent a complete set of FAQs that covered every detail from options of how to get to his place, to where to eat. He also arranged for a taxi for us at the airport and was waiting for us when we arrived. Then he sat with us and oriented us to Athens on the map. We felt like we were insiders since he gave us the the skinny on where to go, where to be cautious, what to see and how to get there. <br/><br/>And of course his place was perfect!  Clean, nicely furnished, coffee, sugar and he even brought a nice bottle of wine. He genuinely wanted to make our experience a positive one and it was.  And don’t forget to eat at Gyromania, right next door. Amazing gyros and village salad. <br/><br/>FYI, the metro is safe, efficient and much more convenient than taxi, beat or uber. (And cheap). Parthenon and shopping are three stops away, about 8 minutes on the redline. <br/><br/>Theo we will be back!  <br/><br/> Nick and Jane"
22144862,467897073,2019-06-11,150735134,Chrisanthe,"Theodore was an amazing host. He sent us lots of  helpful information about the apartment as well as the surrounding area, including every possible way to get there from the airport, safety around the city,  attractions, restaurant recommendations, and more! He met us as soon as we got in from the airport and explained all of this to us in person, and gave us a tour of the property so we'd feel welcome. He was incredibly kind and welcoming, and we'd love to stay with him again some day!  The place itself is in great condition and has everything you need, and is located in perfect location for exploring a neighborhood adjacent to the main tourist sites in Athens."
22144862,469654709,2019-06-15,72311638,Brenda,"Theodore went above and beyond to not only make us feel at home in his rental but in Athens. Thanks to his thorough pre-check-in information guide, getting from the airport to his place was a breeze and he had tons of helpful tips & recommendations for our stay. His place is in a great location - less than 5 min walk to the metro. I HIGHLY recommend staying here."
22144862,471220488,2019-06-17,69779594,Connie,Great location and great for a night or two but wouldn't spend a week there. No proper cooker there only two rings. A bit dark and dingy. . Never met the host as his car broke down and the lady who let us in didn't know much Greek so we were a bit lost the first day.
22144862,472158320,2019-06-19,59654379,Madelene,"Theodore’s apartment is seconds away from the Metro, so it’s the perfect base for an Athenian adventure. The neighbourhood is vey cool, with plenty of bars to keep you well hydrated! Restaurant recommendations were also spot on.<br/>The apartment was fabulously decorated in a kitsch style which we loved.<br/>Thank you Theodore!"

22144862,477376755,2019-06-28,217810608,Aubrey,Airport delays caused us to be a day late. Theodore worked with us and the stay was magical! Plus the AC was a god-send!
22144862,480575336,2019-07-03,70910153,Juho,"The place met the expectations we had and then some! Awesome decor and feeling coupled with functionality and perfect location for our 5-night stay. The neighbourhood habits mainly locals, has good services and both the metro and tram lines run within one block from the flat. Theodore is also the nicest person and most welcoming host, with instant replies when ever needed. Highly recommended!"
22144862,483944748,2019-07-08,179138348,Fabian,"Theodore's apartment is located in a good neighborhood and has easy access to public transport, which brings you to the main sights very quickly.<br/>The apartment is clean and has everything you need for a city trip. We felt really safe in there.<br/>Theodore's recommendations helped a lot to get started in Athens.<br/>I can recommend to stay there."

La décoration est de très bon goût et la cour arrière est agréable pour prendre un café ou un repas. La climatisation est appréciable dans une ville chaude comme Athènes. Théodore est une personne disponible et qui sait recevoir. Nous recommandons cet appartement."
22144862,491353249,2019-07-20,30304684,Hannah,"Theodore's place was great, I'd highly recommend. It is in walking distance of the sights, clean, stylish and Theodore was such a great, thoughtful host and goes above and beyond to make your stay comfortable and pleasant. The location is right near a metro stop although we pretty much walked everywhere and is handy for coffee, bakeries and everything you need!"
22144862,493870454,2019-07-23,53882039,Megan,Theodore is the best Airbnb host I’ve had in any city/country. He goes above and beyond to make sure you’re comfortable and didn’t get annoyed with all of my questions. I could not have felt more welcome. The apartment is perfect and in a great location! I’ll definitely stay here again next time I’m in Athens.
22144862,495541377,2019-07-26,26899826,Danielle,"This apartment is such a great base for exploring Athens.

22144862,500998456,2019-08-03,166618460,Sara,"We absolutely adored this apartment in Athens! It was exactly what my husband and I needed for our honeymoon. Theodore was wonderful with communication and even had a book full with suggestions and helpful tips. We arranged a taxi through Theodore for pickup from the airport so our arrival was seamless from airport to the apartment. The entire apartment was decorated perfectly to our taste (which is why we were leaning towards it in the first place) and the location was just right. <br/><br/>We were just a few feet from the tram and less than a block from the metro, but were also close enough to walk to most major sites in the city. It was also very hot during our stay so the air conditioning was a life saver! If we are ever in the area again we will be looking to use this apartment again. Highly recommended!"

22144862,530639487,2019-09-16,129279705,Drake,Stayed for a couple nights in September and loved it. Perfectly located next to a metro/tram stop.  Right next to the Saturday market and anything you need is only a moment's walk away. We got in super late so the host left a lovely note and bottle of wine. Great handmade booklet of recommendations. Would highly recommend
22144862,539324942,2019-10-01,65345129,Nicolas,"We had a lovely stay at Théodore's apartment. The place was tastefully decorated and very comfortable. We were close to transport lines (we could even feel the metro vibrating at times), and everyday commodities such as mini marts, restaurants and grocery stores. Theodore was very kind and easily reachable via (Hidden by Airbnb) whenever we had any questions and left a very helpful folder with tips in the apartment. Our stay in Athens was definitely a pleasant one thanks to him!"

22144862,546811678,2019-10-14,165889532,Kelsey,"This apartment is conveniently located, clean, nicely decorated, and Theodore is a friendly, welcoming host. His information guide with recommendations and important notes was super helpful. The souvlaki restaurant next door to the apartment was incredible--cheap and delicious. <br/><br/>If you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs because the tram stop is right outside the front door. This is convenient but it also vibrates the entire building whenever it arrives. We got used to it after the first night and appreciated being able to jump on public transit easily. Overall, we'd recommend this place!"

22144862,605692509,2020-02-15,24883034,Nadia,"My boyfriend and I reached out to Theodore last minute after our hotel in Athens wasn’t up to snuff. Not only did he make sure we were able to check out quickly, we were impressed by how clean and great everything was last minute. The apartment is close to a lot of restaurants, shops, and a train station making moving around very convenient. The place itself was comfortable with anything anyone could need, even a nice little guide for what to do around there and in Athens. 10/10 would definitely stay again!"
22144862,651394547,2020-08-15,15895750,Marcel,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Theodore‘s cozy apartment for a month working (remotely) during the week and visiting the regions in the evening/weekend. The stay was just great! The apartment is equipped with everything you need and is conveniently located next to both a tram and a metro station. The tram takes you directly to the beach and the metro is two stations away from the Acropoli. The neighborhood is calm and residential. Moreover, Theodore is a wonderful host. He was very accommodating and helpful anytime we needed anything and had great tips about what to do and where to eat. We definitely recommend his place."
22144862,670881867,2020-10-04,37491753,Aaron,The apartment is located in a safe neighborhood near transportation and near to central Athens. Theodore is a very responsive host. Would rent again.
22144862,716702131,2020-12-20,185150220,Liz,"I don't know where to start. I stayed in Theodore's apartment for 3 months. I have never used Airbnb before and this beautiful apartment was my first experience. Theodore is an amazing host. He made me feel very welcomed. Theodore replied to all my messages straight the way and dealt with requests at the same day. <br/>Apartment is specious, quirky, so many thoughtful designer pieces. Very comfortable and has everything for a comfortable living.<br/>The terrace is very gorgeous. Nice to have breakfast or dinner outside. I did workout there. <br/>Apartment is based in Neos Kosmos (lovely and safe area) near by metro and one step away from tram number 5. Tram can take you to the beaches or Nea Smyrni. Nea Smyrni is a brand new area with a lot of coffeeshop and restaurants. It has a lovely park very well maintained. Apartment is close to Plaka and Acropolis.<br/>All in all I enjoyed my stay. The best experience I had here. So happy to come in Greece, explore this beautiful country and meet lovely people like Theodore."

I appreciated the nearby grocery store (called “Economy”) and coffee shops and bakery. Know that train noises are fairly loud in apartment through the night. I’m a heavy sleeper so it didn’t bother me but it could bother some. Courtyard was so-so but I didn’t use it. Host provided a travel converter when I needed one - which I appreciate. I’ve stayed in tons of Airbnb’s and while this won’t be in my top 5 but it certainly was nice."

At night I often just opened the balcony door. The location is great, a short walk to the Acropolis, easy access to trams, 2 different metro stops. The apartment is kept sparkling clean, and amenities include a very good washing machine and a high powered hair dryer. The hosts couldn’t have been more attentive when  I needed help.

Although it is a private room, it is quite loud when guests of other rooms enter or leave.  The wall between room is quite thin so u can hear.  If u do not mind, it is okay.  If u need more privacy, it is not recommended.  Overall, the place is very very very clean.  There was AC and other required amenities.  Just a matter of expectation.  Thank you Tia & Mike."

We stayed for 2 nights at Tia & Mike’s place and the best part is the convenient location. Almost everything was at walking distance from the air bnb apartment. The room was pretty comfortable with cozy bed and apartment has a kitchenette with Refrigerator and bathroom with a bathtub and washing machine and overall the apartment was cleaned. It has 3 rooms in total and completely safe and secure. Our host has ensured the instructions are well placed in the entire apartment which is really good. We felt that our privacy was maintained. We could cover all the sightseeing places by walking. Taxi is easily available from the main road. At the end we had a superb experience staying at Tia & Mine’s place. Couldn’t have asked for any better place. Absolutely worth it! :-)"

I wouldn’t consider it luxurious, more like modern If anything. Would recommend for short term stay only. There is no view from the apt or bedroom as it is blocked with wood panels."

22145265,331685573,2018-10-03,192461864,Florencia,"Estuvimos solo 2 noches en el alojamiento , y poco tiempo habitándolo pero nos dejo sensaciones muy opuestas por lo que vale hacer un listado .<br/><br/>Positivo: <br/>La información para entrar al departamento se nos envió con mucha anterioridad y pudimos llegar perfectamente y alojarnos.<br/>-Ubicacion, está a 5 minutos de la zona de placa , la acrópolis y estación de metro, por lo cual es ideal para moverse caminando.<br/>-La cocina , a pesar de ser reducida para estar compartida entre 6/7 personas , se encontraba muy bien equipada , ordenada , y limpia .<br/>Espacio para sentarse sólo para 2 personas.<br/>-El dormitorio estaba bien , cama aceptable. Con un poco de olor a encierro.<br/><br/>Negativo:<br/>Baño compartido: el baño merece su propio capítulo. Primero que si el alojamiento está completo es un solo baño para 6/7 personas. Lo cual se convierte en una incomodidad , porque uno debe estar pendiente para salir corriendo al momento que se desocupa , ni hablar horarios de ducha si todos quieren hacerlo al mismo tiempo. <br/>Higiene: las alfombras de piso estaban mugrientas parecía q tenían años acumulando mugre y humedad . La toalla de mano compartida por todos no solo era muy chica, sino que ya estaba húmeda al día que llegamos , y se suponían que se había hecho limpieza de los tres dormitorios.<br/>El inodoro  había q tirar la cadena 2 o 3 veces . La tapa no se levantaba bien y había que sostenerla con la espalda. <br/>El primer día , al ducharnos el agua hervía , solo salía agua caliente, milagrosamente nos dimos cuenta que la llave de paso de agua fría estaba cerrada, aún desconocemos porqué.<br/><br/>Ropa blanca, solo se brinda un toallon grande por persona, pero ninguna toalla de mano / piso , lo que hace que cuando uno va al baño tiene que utilizar la misma toalla con la que se ducha , o  utilizar una toalla mínima de 30x30cm que se comparte con todos los huespedes del alojamiento. Bastante desagradable.<br/><br/>Los dueños viven “muy lejos”  por lo que advierten en las indicaciones que ante cualquier inconveniente para hacer el check-in o durante la estadía , para acercarse cobran  entre 50 -120 euros dependiendo el horario. Siendo dueños del alojamiento, el gesto de recibirte y ayudarte frente a un problema debería formar parte del servicio. Así mismo por perder la llave te cobran 100 euros. Si bien nada debería pasar, consideramos que los montos frente a dichas circunstancias son exorbitantes. Estos aspectos no estaban detallados previamente en las reglas de la casa, fueron informados sobre el momento de hacer el check-in. <br/> <br/>Seba y Flor"
22145265,334021308,2018-10-08,76849691,Michael,The apartment is well cleaned and check in and check out are easy. It is only a few blocks from the Acropolis Museum which is very convenient. Choose this place if you plan to come to Athens.

All of the most popular sights are within walking distance.  There is a grocery down the street and restaurants everywhere. We had 2 couples and 2 kids and the bed set-up was perfect for us.  The apartment building is nice. My kids loved the old-style elevator. The apartment itself is renovated and has a very nice kitchen, doors and blinds- especially in the living room. We felt completely safe. Our host helped us set up a car rental for a day trip and left tips for restaurants and bakeries. Be aware that you will be walking a lot and street parking is available, but very tight."

It is ideally located, 35 minutes from the airport, central, 5 minutes from Acropolis. You just have to park the car once and then walk into Athens. Very convenient to visit museums , sites, areas. There are plenty of restaurants and bars nearby .Take earplugs as evening can be noisy (music and people singing outside)."

It is spacious with three bedrooms and two bathrooms. <br/>Detailed instructions were sent to us which were very helpful, only hitch was key pick up was from a mini market down the street, we received this info quite late and it caused us a little confusion. Also, the mini market guy who we picked the keys up from made some comments to us about the Airbnb's being unprofessional, which we thought was odd.<br/>The restaurants near the apartment were expensive with dreadful food but the gyros and pizza outlets were great.<br/>There were many great shops etc nearby."

However, there were a few issues as listed below.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Great location - in the middle of tourist area, but on a quiet street<br/>- Very large space<br/>- Secure building<br/>- TV with Netflix<br/>- Terrace in living rooms and also two bedrooms<br/>- Air-conditioning in all rooms<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Host was half an hour late for check so had to wait on the street. Was not notified that she was going to be late.<br/>- No hot water for a day and a half<br/>- Hot water takes about 30 minutes to heat up before each shower, so it could take a while for everyone to shower if a lot of people are staying there<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this place if you are staying with a lot of people and want to be close to all of the sights."

A block away from Temple of Zeus and metro, 3 blocks from Acropolis and 14 min walk to Panathenaic stadium. The apartment itself its a bit old but it had everything we needed. The only issue we had was with the hot water. It doesn't last very long so make sure to take short showers.

22155730,396761999797046470,2021-07-01,38812328,Richard,Very nice located. Very big apartment!
22155730,402575588671202586,2021-07-09,12650983,A,Cannot recommend this company or this apartment rental at all.  Too many unacceptable conditions and no resolution to them.  Apparently cleanliness is not a top priority for this rental company.
22155730,414922138045899631,2021-07-26,4311351,Anan,"A superlative 3- bedroom apartment in an unmatched setting.   The location opposite the Parthenon Hotel provides perfect walk-ability  to the Plaka and Acropolis, while still being accessible to cars/taxis.  The apartment itself is much better than pictures with a full kitchen (including mini-dishwasher), perfect ac and a great balcony.   While there is no view to the Acropolis literally around the corner, the location and comfort more than compensate."
22155730,435947307198741477,2021-08-24,71023112,Connor,"A wonderful location, mostly as pictured. However we did some of issues where some things were missing and the hot water stopped working. We reached out to the host, but they ignored all of our messages and we're unresponsive."
22155730,459861412938504165,2021-09-26,196655208,Javier,"LEED esto antes de agendar este piso.<br/><br/>Nos mandaron mal la información de la localización del piso, preguntamos si había parking cerca y no obtuvimos respuesta. Finalmente pudimos hablar con ellos (estando en la puerta de la localización que nos mandaron) y nos dicen que esa no es la dirección, que es otra. Vamos allí y tampoco era la dirección final, ya que había que ir a otro lugar a recoger la llaves del piso, que no es el mismo lugar donde se sitúa el piso.<br/><br/>Después de vivir esta odisea cogiendo varios taxis y con todas las maletas a rastras por medio Atenas... nos encontramos un piso sin agua caliente y con una limpieza muy mala... un auténtico desastre para el precio que pagamos. <br/><br/>Pero aquí no acaba todo, en el mismo bloque habían alquilado otro piso a gente que montó una fiesta hasta las 4-5Am hasta que vino la policía.<br/><br/>Mi peor experiencia, de lejos, en Airbnb.<br/><br/><br/><br/>p.d: La ubicación inmejorable, eso sí."
22155864,320057692,2018-09-08,5704129,Camille&Christophe,"L'appartement était conforme à la description : bien équipé, propre et spacieux. Le plus : la piscine à débordement située sur le toit avec une superbe vue sur Athènes !"

22157691,249440732,2018-04-02,91235544,Τονια,"Το διαμέρισμα βρίσκεται σε μια εξαιρετική τοποθεσια, ακριβώς στο κέντρο της ιστορικής Αθήνας. Είναι ιδιαίτερα καλόγουστα διακοσμημένο και παρά το γεγονος ότι βρίσκεται σε μια παλιά πολυκατοικία είναι πληρως ανακαινισμένο και πεντακάθαρο. Προσφερει όλες τις ανέσεις για μια ευχάριστη διαμονή. Η επικοινωνία με τους ιδιοκτήτες ήταν άμεση και πρόκειται για ευγενεστατους ανθρώπους. Επίσης λόγω της θέσης του μπορείς να ζήσεις και να γνωρίσεις το κέντρο της Αθήνας χωρίς να χρειαστεί να μετακινήσεις καθόλου το αυτοκίνητο σου. Ήταν ένα υπέροχο Σαββατοκύριακο και σ´  αυτό βοήθησε πολύ το σπίτι της Δανάης."
22157691,527499231,2019-09-11,54664136,Jaleh,Great location walking distance to shops and restaurants. Very caring and responsive hosts. They arranged a private ride from the airport which made it so easy for us. Great AC! We were very happy with our stay.  The sofa bed is very comfortable for one person. The main bed is super comfortable. The tree across our room however had blocked the view of Acropolis mostly.

Alles ist zu Fuß erreichbar und die tollen Restaurants und Bars in Psyri sind nur 500 m entfernt. Die Wohnung ist mit ihren 3 Zimmern super geräumig und stylisch eingerichtet. Die Wohnung ist uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen. Der Kontakt war unkompliziert und nett. Es fehlte ein Handtuch, welches uns direkt 30 Minuten später gebracht wurde. Gerne jederzeit wieder."

Quartier un peu bruyant pour les couches tôts mais les restaurants ferment vers minuit et les joueurs de musique finissent par plier bagages à peu près dans ces horaires là.

I am an architect and appreciated the beautiful materials and finishes Nefeli used in renovating this residence. The location is incredibly convenient--in the neighborhood of Kolonaki, but so central that you can walk to many destinations. Also, you can easily take the train from the airport and walk from Syntagma Square if desired.  Nefeli went out of her way to make my stay comfortable and convenient. Thank you, Nefeli, for hosting me!"

The residence is super cool, cozy and unique in an awesome area. If I have the privilege to come to Athens again (which I loved) I will surely stay here again. I even gained some inspiration for my own interior design back home!"
22160312,270770434,2018-05-30,25555149,Leyla,Small but perfectly formed. This apartment is in an unbeatable location between the trendy bars and shops of Kolonaki and Syntagma Sq. The apartment has all you need for a comfortable and relaxing stay right in the heart of Athens and don't forget to check out Yoleni's next door for a tasty brunch. Overall would highly recommend.

The apartment is very tastefully designed and centrally located in a nice neighbourhood with an excellent breakfast deli/cafe downstairs. Very highly recommended. 
22160312,316806335,2018-09-01,11432439,Stefanos,"This is one of your best options if you are visiting Athens. <br/><br/>You will stay in the heart of the capital, in the buzzy Kolonaki neighbourhood, less than 10 min walk from the airport bus stop, art galleries, cafes, restaurants and sight-seeing spots.<br/><br/>The apartment has been tastefully renovated without losing its personality of a 1960s athenian flat. The use of space and the architectural arrangement is exceptional and has been done with care and attention.<br/><br/>The apartment is super clean and comfortable despite its small size. The hostess is accommodating, polite, flexible and friendly.<br/><br/>Fully and highly recommended!"
22160312,318639783,2018-09-04,2202670,Oliver,Nefeli is a great host. The apartment has a sophisticated style and it is located in an elegant neighborhood in the very centre of Athens. Thank you!
22160312,320153844,2018-09-08,4923504,Mary,"Great location and very clean.  Air conditioning worked well for relief from the hot Athens temperature.   Easy walk to most attractions.  Again, can’t say enough about location: everything you might need (grocery store, restaurants, pharmacy, etc) is mere steps from the door.  Nefeli was very helpful in suggesting a reliable, English speaking cab company to call to arrange departure day travel..  Would stay again!"
22160312,323892504,2018-09-16,14354053,Patrick,"This is a really lovely, stylish apartment, in a quiet street, in a great neighbourhood, close to all the amenities, shopping and tourism sights we wanted.

22160312,356778419,2018-12-09,129830123,Hayley,"Nefeli was a gracious host. Quick to respond, etc. The apartment is stunning from a design standpoint and fully amenitized. For long term renters, laundry can be a bit tricky because you can’t hang anything outside (There’s no clothes line as there is no room to put one on the balcony. It’s just the nature of the neighborhood...) and there’s no dryer. But still, the location is outstanding - very close to Syntagma (city center) and bars / restaurants / Lycabettus."
22160312,365255487,2019-01-01,50385427,Grigoris,Very stylish flat. Excellent location for sightseeing and lifestyle. As in a very central location some noise is inevitable.

22160312,449998911,2019-05-08,16903286,Jorge,"El alojamiento se encuentra en una zona con clase de la ciudad, muy cerca de la parte histórica pero fuera del bullicio turístico. Esta diseñado con muy buen gusto. El baño es un poco pequeño por lo que recomiendo el sitio para personas que viajan solas."
22160312,454354815,2019-05-18,258432525,Farhad,"Amazing apartment that is in the best, most beautiful and safest area of Athens.

22160312,460015350,2019-05-28,112852290,Robert,"If you are looking for an apartment in the centre of the city then this is an ideal choice. We never got taxi's and walked everywhere. It is next to the park and Hadrian's Arch, which is the meeting point for most of the walking tours in the city.<br/>The loo and bed are off the kitchen so if you were to come with more than just a couple I would suggest booking the flat that has 2 bedrooms and not relying on the pull out sofa. It's very clean and easy space to stay in."

22160312,530647450,2019-09-16,19266048,Maria,I had stayed at Nefeli’s apartment for a business trip. The fact there there was a separate room (living room/study) was very convenient. Also the location was perfect!
22160312,532082104,2019-09-19,1280133,Sebastian,"The apartment is in an excellent location in Kolonaki, so that almost everything is in walking distance.

22169128,247908270,2018-03-30,163640751,Ajit,The place is in a great location within walking distance of anything you need. The farthest monument or location is at 30 mins walk. Clean place with good value for money. Lots of room. Alex is a wonderful host. He met us at the apartment and walked us through everything we would need to know. He also had maps of the area with interesting locations marked and also answered any and all questions we had. We had a wonderful time.
22169128,258976300,2018-04-30,68275723,Ruby,Had an excellent experience at the flat.  Location is also great!  Flat was very clean and host was great in responding to our questions.

22169128,284012380,2018-07-01,185634328,Dennis,"We enjoyed the time in Athens and in this apartment which was a wonderful choice for us. Very close to many well known sights and also to the next metro station. Moreover, the next stop for the sight seeing buses is only a one minute walk away. Rooms were very clean and furnished. Alex was a great host who booked all our transfers from and to the airport. Definitely a recommendation!"
22169128,293781864,2018-07-21,978037,Celine,Super accueil. Appart top et nickel. Bien situé pour visiter les lieux touristiques d’athenes.
22169128,299514889,2018-07-31,44662301,Virginie,Alex nous a accueilli malgré notre arrivée tardive 2h du matin. Il a pris le temps de nous donner les informations intéressantes Athènes. Le quartier proche du centre ville est surprenant au 1er abord car il est occupé par des anarchistes qui ont littéralement tagué tous les murs. Mais nous avons pu circuler sans aucun problème. Nous recommandons cet appartement très spacieux avec 4 vraies chambres avec chacune leur salle de bain et toilette
22169128,302839306,2018-08-06,63086021,Rose,We had a lovely time and would definitely stay again. The location was very central and the apartment is very spacious and very clean and modern. <br/>

22169128,425384311,2019-03-18,5326194,Dinu,"We had a wonderful time at Maria Eleni's place! We were a group of four women traveling for a school conference and the large open table in the dining area was the perfect place to get together for meals and conversations. Great location where just about everything is in walking distance. Cute rooms that were comfortable, plenty of pots and pans in the kitchen, and we loved having our own bathrooms as well! We got quick responses when we messaged our host, which was very helpful. Pro-tip for future guests - there is a solar heater for hot water in the bathrooms, so if you're staying in cooler months, you may need to switch on the water heater and wait for about 30 mins to take a hot shower. All in all, we loved our stay!"
22169128,429215468,2019-03-27,57117418,Mary,"We had a wonderful stay in Athens. The location was a little further from the central tourist shops than expected, but the walk was easy to the metro which brought you anywhere. The homeowner sent amazing directions to get from the airport to the Airbnb. The homeowner was easy to contact and SO helpful. The place was absolutely wonderful, clean and accommodating for a large group. Definitely recommend."
22169128,431508555,2019-04-01,128199022,Katie,Great place for 4 couples - loads of space and all mod cons. About half an hour walk away from Acropolis. Not the fanciest part of town but perfectly convenient
22169128,436067455,2019-04-12,203915511,Barbara,"I strongly recommend this flat. It is a really comfortable place to visit Athens with family or group od friends. You can walk to most of the touristic places or use public transport. In the flat there is everything you need - even hairdryer, washing maschine, good equipped kitchen."
22169128,437766854,2019-04-15,28135193,Saranya,Highly recommend for those who travel as a group. Great hospitality and facilities.
22169128,442293003,2019-04-23,113543776,Lital,"Big and comfortable apartment, near the main attractions. We walked and used the metro.  The flat was clean, and the host is very welcoming and helpful.  The place could use an ""upgrade"" with som facilities like dishwasher and dryer, and maybe a TV"
22169128,444650108,2019-04-28,243619414,Daniel I.,Everything was awesome
22169128,449134938,2019-05-06,45984488,Sandra,"Overall a good location in a lively alternative area. Some good places to eat and drink nearby. The flat is ideal for a group of friends of different types - singles, couples etc. <br/>The owner was very flexible about check in and check out. Would stay there again."
22169128,451670931,2019-05-12,17593375,Kok Kee,Location great to walk to all the nice place for Greek food and visit Athens
22169128,456627706,2019-05-22,96575253,Marty,"This is a great location so close to the Archeological Museum, which is a definite must see. It’s a little walk to the Acropolis and Plaka. The host is very helpful, speaks English well, and provides some great tips for places to see and go. I highly recommend!"
22169128,461777687,2019-06-01,179236034,Ruth,Four bedrooms and bathrooms make this a great rental for large families or groups. Walk to shopping (historic Plaka area) or the Acropolis in 15-20 minutes. We appreciated the host meeting us on arrival and leaving us 2 sets of keys (since we had 7 people in our party).
22169128,464726625,2019-06-06,227177537,Marie Pierre,Appartement situé dans un quartier où il ne faut pas se promener la nuit.....
22169128,468666635,2019-06-13,61713077,Dennis,4 bathrooms for  8 people - so that was the best reason to stay here!!!  and all very clean and neat and everything works. I would highly recommend and would stay here again.  thank you Eleni
22169128,476923525,2019-06-27,233860936,Carl,"Maria Eleni makes your stay in Athens so easy! <br/>The flat is conveniently arranged in modern style. It all works so well.<br/>She arranged our taxis to and from the airport with seemingly no problems and made sure we had a good driver.<br/>The flat is 5 minutes on foot from the archeological museum, 15 minutes from the Monastriaki Square, where our food tour started and later revisited for shopping, and about a half an hour on foot to the Acropolis.<br/>We felt like we had made a great choice for our stay in Athens."
22169128,479582703,2019-07-01,136954680,Nessa Jae,The apartment is beautiful and in such a great location. Each room has it's own little personal touch to make it unique and rooms and apartment is very spacious.<br/><br/>The apartment was very clean and also very comfortable. It was just a walking distance from Plaka and there are some beautiful authentic Greek restaurants in the streets which was a bonus as west wasn't too far. <br/><br/>I loved everything about the apartment and would definitely recommend this place! The host is just amazing
22169128,486260627,2019-07-12,199739023,William,Bel appartement où il est agréable de séjourner et qui permet de visiter Athènes à pied ! Le seul point négatif fut le bruit venant de la route qui est un peu dérangeant la nuit (c’est le prix à payer pour un appartement plein centre).
22169128,490103414,2019-07-18,251460939,Mary,"It was really nice and spacious.  We had nine people from three families and we could have our own space.   Loved the location, sat out on balcony and watched the traffic and the people come and go.  Gave good directions to shops, groceries and restaurants.   Easy to walk to lots of attractions, restaurants and to hail a cab."
22169128,494833232,2019-07-25,232275674,Freek,"We have stayed in this apartment with a group of 8 people. It was very clean and spacious. The 4 bed- and 4 bathrooms were reason we selected this apartment. The rooms were exactly as advertised on the pictures and all had individual air conditioning units. The living room was very big and came with a table big enough for all 8 of us. The city center was a 10-15 minute walk away, and very easy to find as it is just one long street. We checked in a little late, due to some delay from our flight, but we could arrange this with the owner which was very nice. He provided us with some nice tips and maps of the area. He also helped to arranged our transport from the airport to the apartment with a taxi bus. <br/><br/>Some reviews called the area a bit vague, which probably refers to the neighborhood east of the apartment (at night). For us we didn't experience this as a problem as you don't have to go through there when going to or from the city center. There are some nice restaurants and bars to check out there, but indeed some vague people hang around there as well. <br/><br/>Overall, we would definitely recommend this apartment!"
22169128,501006911,2019-08-03,234561665,Benedikt,Een geweldig appartement en super ligging.
22169128,508088772,2019-08-12,245087334,Agnieszka,"We stayed in this place at the beginning of August 2019, two families (9people).   Lovely huge appartment, beautiful design, very clean bedrooms and bathrooms, all  air-conditioned. Kitchen with all what you need (except dishwasher). Shampoo,body wash, and towels in all 4 bathrooms. Washing machine, iron, ironing board, wifi. Host very nice, with quick respond. Apartment located close to centre of Athens. We walk everywhere except beach. Tram, metro, bus and train nearby too if you wish go to beach. Highly recommended."
22169128,511378722,2019-08-17,160362448,Millie,The place was sharp and we had everything we needed.  They made us feel at home.
22169128,516978034,2019-08-25,16507047,Neel,"Amazing apartment in Athens - large space, lots of bathrooms, clean, AC and blackout blinds, restaurants close by, walkable to all the sites (20-30 minutes). Great communication, checkin and checkout super easy. Highly recommended!"
22169128,523656265,2019-09-04,96340113,Rafael,A casa é exatamente como nas fotos. Espaçosa e confortável. Compatível para um grupo de 8 pessoas. Muito bem localizada. Pudemos explorar a parte histórica de Atenas a pé.
22169128,527082439,2019-09-10,4088822,Anson,"Perfect location within walking distance to several places including shopping, groceries , restaurant and the Acropolis, no need to take a train or taxi so you save dollars on commuting. Easily accessible from the airport by transit as well. However do arrange the taxi with Maria if you have lots of luggage, renting a car is not required as parking can be expensive. <br/><br/>Maria was very thoughtful and considered every single detail guests require and maybe even more. The wifi connection was excellent and we as a group of 8 had no problems. We all had our privacy despite being a group of 8. We enjoyed the sunroom and the art piece. The art piece is great with lots of surprises make sure you explore them while you stay here. <br/><br/>The apartment was very clean and definitely been my best airbnb to date."
22169128,531660021,2019-09-18,115728664,Wendy,"For the amount of space we had for our stay, this was definitely a bargain. Everyone had their own bedroom and bathroom, there is a small sitting room but no livingroom. Most of the action (nightlife and attractions) are about a 15-30 min walk away or a less than 10 min train ride (the closest train station is 6 blocks away). Airport transfer can be arranged ahead of time with the host, which is a nice feature."
22169128,534013273,2019-09-22,5868605,Ursula,"We had a fantastic time in Athens and really loved this apartment. Extremely spacious for 7 guests, clean, stylishly decorated and very helpful check in and communication from Alex. Very impressed, thanks!"

22169128,541394258,2019-10-05,95767776,Andreas,"Das Appartement ist genauso wie von der Vermieterin beschrieben. Die Lage ist wirklich sehr zentral und super für einen Städtetrip in Athen; selbst ein Leihwagen ist in der Nähe für 12€/ Tag gut unterzubringen, so dass alle Freiheiten geboten sind."
22169128,543621346,2019-10-08,18663862,Yining,It was a perfect trip with this flat~Very nice service
22169128,546021081,2019-10-13,41124087,Jagrupe,"Very large and clean flat in a good location which is 15 minutes walking distance to the main sights of Plaka. Host was very helpful, allowing us to have a late check out and very responsive to messages. Note, two of the bedrooms are not ensuite but instead each  have a private bathroom across either a small corridor or in the next room."
22169128,550655252,2019-10-19,20689268,Kirstine,"We stayed the whole family with 8 people in Maria's beautiful appartment. So luxury with four bathrooms. We where very happy with everything. Great location, a small walk from the center and still super close to many great places in a nice neighborhood. Maria was very helpful with good suggestions for everything (places to eat, what to see and do) and help with arranging transport from and to airport - and also for our day in the beach. Athens is a great city and Maria made our stay super comfortable. Thank you for everything."
22169128,553916827,2019-10-25,22181319,Phyllis,"The place is exactly as what is advertised; spacious, clean, modern design and located in a very convenient location. There is no doubt Alex who we communicated during our stay is worthy of being a super host! He was there during our check in to show us the rooms and the amenities. He even took time to explain the map of Athens and gave us some useful local tips. What is most outstanding about his hospitality is his flexibility in meeting our needs. Definitely a recommendation to anyone who wants to rent a spacious apartment in Athens!"
22169128,558787194,2019-11-03,14971597,Nadine,"L'emplacement de l'appartement est idéal. Tout peut quasiment se faire à pied et pour les sorties à l'extérieur de la ville, le métro est à 5 minutes à pied. Les graffitis ds le quartier peuvent surprendre mais c’est aussi ce qui fait son charme (très belles photos à faire) et le quartier est calme. Le musée d'archéologie est à deux pas et plein de commerces sont présents. Sur huit personnes, seules deux habituées au grand calme de la campagne ont eu à s'adapter un peu au bruit de la rue. Les autres ont dormi ""comme des bébés"". L’appartement est magnifique et très joliment décoré avec goût et simplicité. Nos hôtes ont été très réactifs sur un petit incident avec l'eau chaude ce qui fait que nous n'avons pas eu de problème au final. Cette réactivité est très appréciable. Ce séjour à Athènes nous a vraiment conquis. Petit conseil : ne ratez pas la découverte de Vouliagnemi Lake et de l'île d'Hydra. Merci à Maria Elena et Alex pour leur accueil."
22169128,564622490,2019-11-16,22931552,Shawn,"This is a great place for a large group, central to subways, next door to acropolis archaeology museum (0.1 mile), and walking distance (~ +0.5 miles) to many of the historic sites and eating establishments.  Two great food spots nearby H Kriti (excellent authentic greek food) and Stani for desserts.  Our flight was delayed and we were accommodated a late checking with thorough instructions on how to use everything in the apartment, how to travel locally, eat, etc.  A first class experience for us as two of our group ran the Athens marathon and two volunteered at the finish (Panathaneiac stadium).  Also was able to hike the nearby (~ 0.8miles) Mount Lycabettus to get great views to ocean and city."
22169128,567307310,2019-11-22,85231144,Katia,"Appartamento davvero molto bello, elegante, pulitissimo , in una posizione ottima, vicinissimo al Museo Archeologico e 10 minuti a piedi dalla fermata della Metro .Pulizia ottima e assistenza per trasporti privati e indicazioni varie ... .Consigliatissimo..."
22169128,584577077,2019-12-30,35928841,Varun,"Maria's place is very homely, spacious and has all the needed amenities. We had a great family reunion time staying here. Location is quite good: right next to the museum and close to many restaurants. The street adjacent to the apartment usually has free places available to park your car during the day. There is also a safe underground parking garage (3 mins walk, Polis park) for overnight and long duration parking. I recommend this place to families visiting Athens."

In addition, Alex gives great feed back and tips as you start your adventures  in Athens, Greece.<br/>The Airbnb is in  a safe environment. <br/>Be sure to read the information  regarding the flat , before you leave your room. It is very helpful with information regarding  getting in and out of the flat, and recommended places to eat nearby. You may want to download (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate to assist speaking with taxi drivers or commoners. A great taxi app is called Beat, it's like what we call Uber. <br/>I overall,  enjoyed my stay here I have no complaints. Thank you Alex and Maria for making your Airbnb feel like a home away from home."
22169128,427309868211253987,2021-08-12,165254817,Krzysztof,"Great host and perfect suite. The host looked after us throughout the stay, sent us useful information and offered advice. The apartment is very comfortable and well located. It made the stay in Athens really great."

22169128,450487211018156674,2021-09-13,52462251,Manise,The flat was located in the historic section of Athen close to the universities and Syntagma Square. Max a 20 min walk to the Acropolis. Alex and team went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. The flat matched the pictures and was spotless with a nice balcony. This would be a great option for a group
22169128,452589260109928640,2021-09-16,365741025,Victor,The pictures we're very accurate. And the appartment Comfortably housed all 9 of us. Airco was good and the appartment had everything we needed. Everything considered a good experience.
22169128,460593705292915239,2021-09-27,7971418,Amra,"Excellent apartment, exactly like in the pictures, large, bright and super comfortable. I traveled with my mom, uncle and another relative and we all had our privacy. Communication with Maria Eleni and Alex went smoothly, when we couldn’t locate a hair dryer in the apartment a new one was delivered promptly. Two sets of keys make it easy for a large (or a small like ours) group to move around the city more independently. I would highly recommend Maria Eleni’s apartment to everyone who appreciates the comfort and luxury of having four separate bedrooms, each with its own bathroom, in a great location."

22169128,474356856957775768,2021-10-16,53456166,Kimberly,"Amazing lay out, wonderful location, fantastic charm, absolutely perfect!  <br/><br/>The 4 bedroom, 4 bathroom layout situated our family of eight comfortably .  The apartment is tastefully decorated, open, comfortable and sparkling clean. In addition to large balconies off three of the bedrooms are multiple gathering spaces one with a large dining table and others with seating. <br/><br/>Each room has electric shutters to let the light in or out and individual climate control. We walked or took the metro (a stop is just a few blocks from the apartment) to all major attractions and location is excellent. <br/><br/>As a huge added bonus the host helped us line up transportation to and from the airport with flawless communication.  <br/><br/>We had a lovely time, would recommend this apartment to all and would be honored to stay as guests again in the future."
22176005,247673277,2018-03-29,63039305,Angelina,"Το βασικό πλεονέκτημα του σπιτιού είναι η τοποθεσία του. Βρίσκεται κυριολεκτικά 2 λεπτά από τη στέση του μετρό ""Συγγρού-Φιξ"" και στον κεντρικό δρόμο κάτω από το σπίτι μπορεί να βρει κανείς ταξί καθ'όλη τη διάρκεια της ημέρας. Μένουν άνετα 5 άτομα, καθώς είναι πολύ ευρύχωρο και σωστά διαρρυθμισμένο. Μείναμε πολύ ικανοποιημένοι."

We arrived late because of our flight and the owner did not charge us a late fee because of it. In addition, the hotel is next to resturants, the acropolis, the metro, and tram lines. Also there is a grocery store nearby. It is a super awesome place to stay and I recommend everyone to stay there."

22185626,247908067,2018-03-30,141871213,David,We had an absolutely phenomenal experience! The apartment was as advertised and very clean. It is located about a 5-minute walk from a number of great restaurants and a 20-minute walk from the marketplace. There is also a metro station close by with instructions in a number of languages (very easy to use). I sent four questions to Menelaos; all were answered very quickly with great suggestions. We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Athens.
22185626,256908034,2018-04-24,181610693,Ana,"Nice and comfy flat, great neighbourhood...we had a great time!<br/><br/>Thanks!"

Very close to the metro station and restaurants.  The acropolis is within walking distance  (about 15 minutes).  The tram station was also very close which we used to take to the beach.  They also offered to have a driver pick us up from the airport (our expense) and we were very happy with the service. 
22185626,267865580,2018-05-23,13522686,Mary Ann,"Very, very spacious and beautifully decorated place!<br/><br/>The air con is not in the room, so we had to open the balcony door which is quite noisy at night. <br/><br/>Other than that, everything is lovely and it s so close to the attractions and delicious restaurants!<br/><br/>Love the washer and dryer and so many other amenities!"

22185626,276289164,2018-06-13,17756116,Henrik,"Great stay at Menelaos's apartment. Just renovated, a lot of space, two balconies, very comfy beds...we had a stunning holiday. The location is spot on! You find yourself surrounded by many good restaurants and bars. Our favorite one was the Kalamaki bar! No really cons but I think the ac unit is not in the optimal place, hard to cool the bedrooms or maybe placing a fan in the corridor would help? <br/><br/>We didn't meet Manelaos but Ignacios managed all the things perfectly, great Greek hospitality once a again! We also used the transportation which he offered and it was 5/5. A Strong recommendation! "

22185626,285564129,2018-07-04,183198608,Mandar,"We were in Athens during summer (early July).  Menelaos ‘s place is centrally located, about 9 minutes walk from Acropolis. Close enough for stroll to Plaka but without noise and hustle in the center.<br/>Check in and checkout were flawless with Menelaos arranging taxi to and from airport.<br/>Place is clean, well stocked and inviting.<br/>Again, key for us was location, location, location. This was exactly the place we were looking for."

22185626,308868147,2018-08-17,101068328,Andrew,Book with confidence-this is a great place to discover Athens.<br/>You feel like you’re in the suburbs but you aren’t you are right at the heart of this fabulous city.5 minutes walk from the Acropolis-15 minutes walk from the city centre- you cannot go wrong.<br/>Clean throughout- easy check in and out-5 stars all the way.
22185626,311878990,2018-08-22,151826542,John,"The space is clean, good location for all walkable sites. Max walk of 15-20 minutes. Good & immediate responses from Menelaos. We had a wonderful stay. Only hiccup was there are no AC s in the bedroom but we managed in the drawing room as there is a sofa-cum-bed & AC there. Additional points for Menelaos for being flexible on our check out time.<br/>Thank you it was wonderful."
22185626,321389092,2018-09-10,49841934,Sam,"Great location if you’re willing to do the touristic tour. It’s 2 min walk away from the metro station which is only one stop away from the Acropolis station, and the next stop to the main square that leads to the Plaka area and the market. There are plenty of nice bars, restaurants/lounges around the area.<br/>The house is neat and clean. No complaints at all."
22185626,326775393,2018-09-23,216264934,Natalia,Very spacious apartment with all the necessary amenities included. Located in close proximity to the restaurants and historical places.

Host was very attentive and answered almost immediately to all our questions. I definitely recommend this location.  5 stars."

22185626,348261038,2018-11-13,49698945,Charlotte,"We loved our time in Athens and the apartment is in a perfect central location, with great bars and restaurants within 100m. <br/>The flat was excellent and in great condition, with really easy access, good kitchen/ bathroom/ WiFi etc. <br/>The service has been really good and thank you Menelaos for looking after us so well and being so easy to liaise with. We had such a great trip that we will be back again soon so hope to stay at Menelaos’ again"
22185626,368570758,2019-01-07,226816246,David,"Nuestra semana en Atenas fue increíble, el apartamento está muy cerca a los principales atractivos turísticos. De igual forma estaba muy limpio, y tenía todos los servicios(toallas, sábanas, instrumentos de cocina, dos pares de llaves, etc...) Nuestros hospedador, una persona muy amable y muy dispuesta a ayudarnos enseguida lo necesitaramos, con la mayor disposición. Sin duda alguna me volvería a hospedar en este lugar."
22185626,415673251,2019-02-23,236127934,Nora,"Πολύ ωραίο ήσυχο διαμέρισμα σε πολύ κεντρικό σημείο. Καθαρό και ζεστό, με οργανωμένη κουζίνα, πλυντήριο και στεγνωτηριο κατάλληλο για μεγάλες διαμονές. Πραγματικά νιωθαμε σα στο σπίτι μας. Η κυρία Μαίρη πολύ φιλική, ευγενική και έτοιμη να μας βοηθήσει σε ότι χρειαζόμαστε. Ευχαριστούμε πολύ."
22185626,434673925,2019-04-08,19624172,Colin,"Very well located, spotlessly clean, spacious and comfortable apartment. What more could you ask for? We would happily stay at Menelaos' place again."
22185626,440839315,2019-04-21,252862399,Melissa,"El piso es todo lo que se muestra en la fotos, es muy acogedor, bonito y esta prácticamente nuevo así que todo se encuentra funcionando y en perfecto estado. La ubicación también es muy buena, puedes llegar a los principales sitios turísticos con una pequeña caminata pero no esta dentro del bullicio, los alrededores son tranquilos, los restaurantes de la zona baratos y la estación de metro está muy muy cerca. <br/>Lo recomiendo muchísimo."
22185626,443050093,2019-04-25,168532069,Susan,"Our experience was a treat. Menelaos was super responsive to our questions before and during our trip and a great host. <br/><br/>The apartment is very spacious, clean and as described. The location is great, near Plaka, Acropolis, Parthenon, Acropolis museum, Syntagma Square, metro stations... everywhere you would want to go. We easily walked everywhere even with a 7 and 8 year old. <br/><br/>The apartment is secure, on the 4th floor (elevator) and relatively quiet for a city. There is a mini market across the street and supermarkets a few blocks away.  Full kitchen though we only used it for coffee and snacks. Great WiFi and TVs in most every room. Two balconies overlooking the streets. The beds were very comfortable.<br/><br/>We arrived in the evening and had his taxi driver pick us up at the airport. He was waiting for us, showed us everything in the apartments. Taxi fees from the airport are regulated so it was nice to have someone there, waiting for us. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend Menelaos’ place to anyone."
22185626,452498618,2019-05-13,170463468,Richard,"Menelaos’ apartment was just as he said it would be.  There were 4 of us, and we had plenty of space.  The beds were comfortable and the apartment was quiet and very secure, even though it is located in a very busy part of town.   It was pleasant to enjoy a cup of coffee on the balcony.  The kitchen was fine,  and although we did not use it much, it was adequately appointed.  There were simply too many great, inexpensive places to eat nearby!  Make sure you go to Kalamaki Bar and Ambrosia - just around the corner.  The bathroom is adequate, but could use a remodel.  We are walkers, and we found so much available within walking distance.  The Acropolis, Parthenon and Mars Hill area is an easy - although uphill - walk.  Other sites are easy to get to using the absolutely spotless Metro subway system.   Compared to other places, Menelaos’ place seemed to us to be a good value, especially since there were 2 couples splitting the cost.  I have no hesitation about recommending Menelaos’ apartment!"
22185626,455728542,2019-05-20,158274257,Alexandre,We had a terrific time. I will always recommend your apartment.
22185626,462652390,2019-06-02,42555590,Boris,Perfect place to stay in Athen!!!
22185626,465625794,2019-06-08,35178132,Diane,This place was clean and lovely to stay at.  The host was very helpful setting up rides to and from the airport for us and was very quick with responding. Our experience staying here was nothing but extraordinary. Thank you for making us feel welcome in Athens and for making our stay pleasant.  Most definitely a 5-star place!
22185626,472151781,2019-06-19,259302109,Rendy,We really enjoy staying at Menelaos’ place. It is located close to a Metro station and walking distance (~15 mins) to Acropolis and (~20 mins) to Plaka area.<br/>The property is clean. AC worked wonderful in this hot summer (there are AC in each bedroom and living room). Washer and dryer are huge bonus in this property.<br/>We really appreciated Menelaos’ responses and input. Check in process was flawless although we arrived after midnight as Menelaos has arranged transportation for us. <br/>There are a lot of place to eat nearby and a bakery nearby - the people at the bakery were wonderful. There is also a grocery store across the street.<br/>We didn’t use the kitchen but there glasses and utensils that can be used.<br/>We really recommend this place.
22185626,473734848,2019-06-22,261097739,Iris N,"Metro y bus sumamente cerca ( como a 3 minutos ). Lugares de comida justo al lado. El portero me recibió rápido al llegar. El apartamento impecable, cómodo y equipado."
22185626,486845235,2019-07-13,110695554,Bryce,Really great host. Great place to see everything in the city
22185626,509958665,2019-08-15,9193143,Francois,"The aparment is ideally located: a few minute walk to the Acropole, though sufficiently out of the noisy district. Around the apartment there are good restaurants, a very good bakery and the metro station is at 2 minute-walk only. The apartment is amazingly clean, very well-equiped, and the district is very quiet at night. Air conditioning works perfectly. Menelaos is extremely reactive, helping to find the way to the apartment from the airport is reachable at any time for any question.<br/>I would highly recommend this apartment as the best solution to visit Athens."
22185626,532558105,2019-09-20,131370756,Greg,"Menelaos' apartment was exactly what my wife and I were looking for in Athens. It is close to the Acropolis (~5-10 min walk) and all the amazing tourist sites, yet far away enough to really feel like you are an Athenian! Menelaos was very quick to respond to my numerous questions before and during the trip. He arranged our airport transfers and everything! We couldn't have asked for a better host and place to stay! Thank you Menelaos!"
22185626,536140931,2019-09-26,168409071,Ian,"Very clean, Menelaos made transportation easy! And he is a great host! Close to all the spots!"
22185626,538861164,2019-09-30,46849403,Chelsea,"The apartment is spacious and the location is perfect for exploring the Acropolis, the Plaka, and surrounding areas. Plenty of restaurants and grocery stores nearby."
22185626,543142961,2019-10-07,65240366,Janine,Great location! Within walking distance to the acropolis and sites. Good restaurants across the street for a quick meal. Great communication and response time. The beds were comfortable and air conditioning in each of the bedrooms and living area. We had a lovely stay! Great value!
22185626,560293007,2019-11-06,10278945,Flavie,"Menelaos was very helpful and flexible. He booked a taxi for us when we arrived at the airport.<br/>The flat is spacious and really close to many restaurants and the acropolis, which is very pleasant."
22185626,588778375,2020-01-05,60395214,Dimitris,Πολύ ευρύχωρο και άνετο διαμέρισμα πολύ ιδανικό για οικογένειες! Συνιστάται ανεπιφύλακτα

22185626,764913006,2021-05-31,9233921,Jodi,"We cancelled our stay after 1 day due to serious issues. This place has been neglected; it looked as if even the most basic cleaning was not performed prior to our arrival. There were cockroaches, hundreds of other dead insects, and rodent feces throughout the apartment. The balconies were soiled with bird feces. Grime was all over the kitchen, door handles, and light switches throughout the apartment. The dirty floor turned our feet black. The apartment is old, decrepit, and the building had a smell of something rotting. The listing’s photos and description do not match our experience. While the hosts apologized, all sorts of excuses and denials were given for these observations and our pictures and videos justify all of our words in this review. The host offered to move us to a hotel for the night or a full refund, including a reassurance we’d get the AirBnB service fee refunded, if we chose to cancel our booking. It was late and we were exhausted so we agreed to the refund, but did not receive the service fee as promised, and were (de facto) told that it was our problem at that point. We moved out to a clean AirBnB the next day as soon as we could check-into it."
22185626,454092336870449385,2021-09-18,200718378,Jeremy,"Stayed here for 3 months with my family. This is one of those places that just works. Big, functional, and having 2 balconies is pretty sweet. The internet isn't great, but it is the best you can get in the heart of the city. The closer you are to the Acropolis, the crapier the internet gets. It's an Athens thing, I guess. AC is good, but doesn't reach the kitchen, or the main sitting room. Loads of fans and even in 47 degree heat, it is fine.<br/><br/>The location is spectacular. Close to all the attractions, metro and buses right there, and the restaurants! So many, and all of them amazing.<br/><br/>Out the door to the left is the best coffee shop I've found. Out and to the right is Kalamaki. Exceptional food. An 8 minute walk is Romatella. Best pizza you'll have, and also go to Django. Literally the best ice cream in the world.<br/><br/>Overall, a great stay. Athens is a treasure, and this apartment is an excellent base from which to explore."

My stay here was wonderful , I felt that I was in my own house and I did not want to leave!<br/>The apartment was very clean and the bed soooo comfortable!!! <br/>Olga provided everything.... shampoo, body wash , detergent for washing machine,  toilet paper, napkins, tea, coffee, sugar.  I did not need to buy any of these things.<br/>The position of the apartment is right next to the metro station. It is a 10 minute walk to the Parthenon and Syndagma square. I felt very safe even coming home late at night as the apartment is so central and there are always people around. <br/>As a host, Olga made me feel that  I could contact her at any time. I will definitely want to stay here again!!<br/><br/>Το διαμέρισμα της Όλγας είναι ακριβώς όπως στις φωτογραφίες. Πολυ όμορφος χώρος! Πέρασα τέλεια και το ένιωθα δικό μου σπίτι,  τόσο που δεν ήθελα να φύγω! <br/>Το διαμέρισμα ήταν πάρα πολύ καθαρό και το κρεβάτι πολύ αναπαυτικό. <br/>Υπήρχε  ότι χρειαζόμουν.  Σαμπουάν,  αφρόλουτρο,  απορρυπαντικο πλυντηρίου, χαρτί υγειας,  καφέ,  τσάι,  ζάχαρη. Δεν χρειάστηκε να αγοράσω τίποτα από ολα αυτά. <br/>Το διαμέρισμα είναι κυριολεκτικά πάνω απ το Μετρό.  Είναι 10 λεπτά περπάτημα από Παρθενώνα και πλατεία Συντάγματος. <br/>Ένιωθα πολύ ασφαλής στο διαμέρισμα και ακόμα όταν γύρναγα σπίτι αργά, αφού είναι σε κεντρικό σημείο,  έχει συνέχεια κόσμο. <br/>Σαν οικοδέσποινα η Όλγα με έκανε να νιώθω ότι μπορούσα να επικοινωνήσω μαζί της για ότι χρειαστώ. <br/>Σίγουρα θα ήθελα να μείνω εδώ ξανά! !"

The apartment was right next to the metro and was only one or two stops away from the main sights of Athens. Within walking distance of the apartment are many great restaurants that are much cheaper (and better) than the ones you would find next to the Acropolis/Plaka.

Great coffee bar underneath and everything else you could possibly want (supermarket,  metro, pharmacy) are all extremely close.  The place was clean, safe and well appointed.  Close to all of the major attractions. But the difference at this apartment is the host. She is exceptional (she arranged for my pick up at the airport and offered help during a medical situation) and her brother was a big help at checkout.  Nothing but good things to say.  I would definitely stay here again."

Close to attractions/tourist spots. 24/7 Kimbo Bakery/Pastries shop is just next door. Pharmacy, Coffee shops/Restaurant is just few mins walk. Bars/Night clubs is on the other side. Olga's place has toiletries from shampoo, conditioner to water bottle and even coffee/tea is provided. Washing machine is also there too. We love the wine and chocolates. We couldn't ask for more! Our only regret is not staying longer in Olga's apartment. This is the best airbnb in Athens. It even beats the 5 star Hotel that we have stayed in with a super value price. We will definitely come back again and will recommend Olga's apartment to our friends/family visiting Athens. Once again, thank you Olga for making our trip in Athens wonderful. Two thumbs up!"

The bus is right in front of the building and the subway entrance is right by its side.

The apartment itself is neat, clean and quiet, is fully equipped with all the necessary amenities for a longer stay. Olga, the lovely hostess, was very accommodating and responded to all our communication promptly even at night despite having a day job which is impressive.<br/>This apartment in the very best sense is more than you bargain for. We hope Olga will host us the next time we are in Greece."

And even went out of her way to help us in other aspects like finding alternative accommodation for when her place was already booked, arranging transport for us even to our other accommodation, and getting us prompt attention when we had issues with the door. We really enjoyed her cosy apartment and loved the little touches in deco and amenities. Was our favourite Airbnb in Greece!"

She even gave me some medicine for my cold. It also has an amazing price. It doesn't have a view but if you are going to be outside all day it's not really necessary. We had a bit of trouble with wifi but it was the company's fault. I would stay here again if I were to go to Athens in the future."

Les lits sont confortables. Il se trouve à moins d'un kilomètre de la place Syntagma, moins d'un kilomètre du palais présidentiel, moins d'un kilomètre du stade olympique et à une quinzaine  de minutes à pied de l'acropole. <br/><br/>Nous avons eu la chance d'assister à une procession dans notre propre rue. <br/><br/>Le quartier est calme, tout en ayant les petites boutiques à proximité. Le restaurant traditionnel de quartier, Olympieion, vaut le détour !"

Better than  pictured, great clean design. Feels more like a chic hotel suite. I immediately felt comfortable and at home. The flat is spotless and Spyros has organized it so you have everything you could possibly need.  Its got a fantastic balcony (two, actually!) immensely comfortable bed, well-equipped kitchen.  Its situated in one of the best neighborhoods in central Athens with a lovely Friday market close by, several great restaurants and bars, close to top sights and just removed enough to be a relaxing retreat.

22186261,335058215,2018-10-11,39883725,Elsa,Excellent host. Very neat and clean. Lots of extra goodies. Highly recommended.
22186261,336317047,2018-10-14,11291662,Anna,"This apartment is a jewel in Athens. It's even better than on the fotos, the flat is amazing, clean, cosy, central, quite and the best place for a city trip. The area is surrounded by lovely cafes, tavernas and bars and its close to the main sightseeing points- even walking distance. I enjoyed it a lot and on my next Athens trip I'll come again. Spyros is such a lovely host, he prepared everything with lots of love, was always available and give me the best advices. Efkaristo poli my friend!! See you soon"
22186261,337685512,2018-10-17,837951,Jessica,"We had a fantastic stay at Spyros’ place. The apartment was great, and Syros was an outstanding host - warm, friendly, generous and accommodating. We loved the local taverna recommended by Syria - don’t miss Olympian if you love amazing food. Mets is an amazing area outside the touristy hustle of Athens, but close enough to walk everywhere you need to go."

22186261,346059428,2018-11-07,38456953,David,"Perfect apartment in a perfect location with a perfect host. We stayed at Spyros apartment for one week and honestly could have stayed longer. It is a lovely space for two people only a 10 min walk to Acropolis and metro station. The really nice thing about this apartment is its proximity to up and coming neighborhoods outside of the tourist trail. There is a grocer, pharmacy and the usual amenities on your doorstep but even better there are a couple of squares nearby with cool cafes, restaurants (Olympian!!) and nice bars. This was a great experience as we saw the 'real' Athens and always felt safe and welcome. Spyros is an exceptional host with amazing organisations and communications whilst never making it feel fussy. The welcome was warm and he kept in touch to check everything was OK and offered a lot of advice and help on day trips and airport transfers etc.. Meeting Spyros truly added to our holiday."
22186261,347868391,2018-11-12,9932723,Luke And Katie,The apartment was large and spacious enough for our stay. It was within walking distance to many of the main sights in Athens.

When we had issues with the washer machine -- which was not the host's fault at all -- she was there immediately to help us, even doing our laundry for us and dropping it off to us.<br/><br/>The wifi can be a bit inconsistent, but it seems like that's the case with most ADSL connections throughout Athens. We can't really fault the home or host for this. As soon as we had an issue, she called the company to try to remedy it.<br/><br/>The home is sparkling clean. Lots of thoughtful touches. Great coffee. Christina and Tina greeted us with food. Wow, I'm very impressed as a Superhost myself. :)"

Upon my arrival Spyros’s sister was at the apartment to welcome me, and made me feel immediately at home. The apartment is beautifully decorated and equipment with absolutely anything you might need (there were even some snacks for me like oranges, apples, bread and feta cheese, tea and coffee). The location is great, just 10-15 min walking to Acropolis. I had contact with Spyros throughout my whole stay in case I would need anything. Also the WiFi signal was strong, and worked perfectly during my whole 10 days stay. I would definitely recommend this place, do not hesitate and book it, if it’s available !"

Comunicativo, muy simpático y dándonos todas las explicaciones necesarias para hacer nuestra estancia lo más agradable posible. Nos dejó algo de fruta, agua y bebidas en la nevera! El piso está localizado en una zona casi inmejorable. No cogimos transporte en ninguno de los 3 días q estuvimos allí, ya que en unos minutos te plantas en cualquier punto importante de la ciudad.

It was clean and well-decorated. The only disadvantage is that the bedroom close to the street was a bit noisy. However, we spent pleasant time there and if one day we had to come back to Athens, we would contact Anastasia for her wonderful hospitality."
22190747,258055225,2018-04-28,26783973,Rafael,"Apartamento lindo no centro do melhor bairro de Atenas.<br/>Da para ir caminhando a Acrópole, as ruazinhas cheias de restaurantes e bares, enfim a tudo.<br/>Apartamento bem arrumado, espaçoso e estiloso.<br/><br/>Super recomendo este lugar!"
22190747,260806238,2018-05-05,9661522,Stephanie,"Le logement proposé par Anastasia est situé en plein centre des quartiers très touristiques d'Athènes. Très animé, vous trouvez tout au pied de l'appartement, jusque tard le soir. Une supérette est située à quelques mètres, très pratique pour les petites courses. Au pied de l'acropole, des stations de metro/tramway, tout se fait très facilement à pieds. Anastasia à été une super hôte ; nous sommes arrivés plus tard que prévu (vers 23h/23h30) dû à un retard de l'avion, mais Anastasia était présente et très accueillante. Elle est très réactive aux messages, ce qui a été rassurant. Nous avons eu un soucis d'eau chaude le 1er jour, qui a immédiatement été réglé, dans la journée du lendemain. Concernant le logement, il etait très propre et décoré avec beaucoup de goût. L'air conditionné était appréciable. Les 2 chambres sont spacieuses, la salle de bain aussi et le séjour très agréable. La cuisine est moins pratique car petite et équipée de 2 petites plaques électriques (mais pour 1 semaine, nous avons pris tous nos repas au restaurant). Les lits étaient un peu trop fermes à notre goût, mais ça, ça dépend des préférences de chacun. Nous ne manquerons pas de recontacter Anastasia si nous revenons à Athènes. Merci pour tout !"
22190747,262479542,2018-05-09,40695184,Baylea,"Location was awesome, right in the Plaka- most monumental sights within walking distance. Many options for food, drinks and shopping nearby. The apartment was very clean. The only disadvantages were that the apartment is not very sound proof, so if you’re a light sleeper this may be an issue. As well the beds are quite firm. Otherwise was a great place to stay for sightseeing!"
22190747,264899128,2018-05-15,74633456,Rafael,"Anastasia’s place is great! It is very in Plaka, a great neighbourhood of Athens, and she is super friendly. I strongly recommend her place."

Perfect location for the many restaurants, shops and attractions. <br/>Apartment is clean, modern and very spacious. It’s also on the First floor with on a few stairs so easy access for bags. <br/>I definitely recommend the apartment. Thanks. "
22190747,272762594,2018-06-04,22628437,Rachael,The location couldn’t have been better! So close to the Acropolis and shopping/restaurants. Loved my stay and will definitely choose this apartment for my next trip to Athens!
22190747,273737521,2018-06-07,5166726,Berenice,Anastasia is very kind...she received us too late without a problem. The place is super nice and very well located. We had some issues but Anastasia was very understanding. Totally recommend this apartment.
22190747,275894871,2018-06-12,21840135,Rachelle,"Lovely apartment, great location. Anastasia was very nice. Unfortunately, there were cockroaches, but these are a big problem in the entirety of Athens. Anastasia was very helpful in finding a solution. "
22190747,278977871,2018-06-19,82656809,David,Great location! Really nice place and personal touches. We really enjoyed dealing with the host who was polite & responsive. <br/><br/>We would certainly recommend it again!
22190747,279980554,2018-06-22,57952874,Vania,"A Anastasia foi incrivelmente gentil e solícita. O apartamento fica bastante próximo aos principais pontos turísticos. Só precisei de táxi uma vez! Deixo apenas um comentário: em frente ao apartamento existe uma Taverna (restaurante/bar grego), que fica aberto até mais tarde. Traz o benefício de ter movimento até mais tarde, mas gera barulho em frente à janela da sala e de um dos quartos."
22190747,280905964,2018-06-24,115548315,Martina,"Perfect location, espacious place, Anastasia was great!"

22190747,283115048,2018-06-29,11459713,Javier,This place is in an amazing location. Anastasia set the apartment nicely for our arrival. We would book here again when we return to Athens.
22190747,284856481,2018-07-02,27180721,Yaroslaw,"Clean, quiet and close to everything.  Anastasia was very responsive to all our questions.  Would stay there again anytime and definitely recommend."
22190747,290998427,2018-07-15,64803234,Adam,"The stay at Anastasia's apartment was absolutely perfect. You will not find a better location to stay where you will be able to wander through the Plaka, take a short walk to the top of the Acropolis, very close access to several really good restaurants and grocery stores. I will definitely be staying here again if/when I return to Athens."

22190747,310194866,2018-08-19,31496946,France,"Appartement parfaitement bien placé, au cœur du centre historique mais dans une rue très calme. Sa décoration est soignée et on s’y est immédiatement senti comme chez nous."
22190747,311902436,2018-08-22,24043692,Mark,This apartment has the perfect position to everything you need to do in Athens. The apartment is spacious and clean my wife and myself loved it.

22190747,324885432,2018-09-18,32372455,Eve,"We had the best time (and our first time) in Athens.<br/><br/>The location of the apartment is superb - only a few steps away from one of the main streets in Plaka - great for shopping, eating delicious food at wonderful cafes and restaurants, all a short walk. <br/><br/>Even more importantly, the location is also a 5-15 minute walk to many of Athens most visited sites - making it easy to reach our activities such as the walking tour of Athens, Acropolis and Parthenon and new Acropolis Museum. <br/><br/>Check in was smooth and the apartment is clean, tidy and contained everything we needed.<br/>It was a relaxing space to return to after a busy day walking the streets of Athens. <br/><br/>We can’t recommend it enough - thank so much!"
22190747,327610185,2018-09-24,110809196,Diana,An incredibly charming space and a fabulous location. Easy access since the apartment is on the first floor. There is a small balcony which leads to a lovely side street full of opportunities for people watching and relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. Communications with Anastasia were very timely and accurate. Checkin was a breeze. Highly recommend!
22190747,330934036,2018-10-01,28823227,Florence,"Hormis quelques absences d'informations non communiquées avant notre arrivée et quelques petits soucis (problème wifi, eau chaude notamment), l'appartement est bien situé dans le quartier de Plaka, à moins de 5 mn de la station de métro Syntagma et du terminus du bus venant de l'aéroport. Aucune rencontre avec la propriétaire du lieu, tout se passe par l'intermédiaire d'une boutique située juste à côté de l'appartement. Pas toujours simple, mais tout le monde essaie de répondre au mieux."
22190747,335107831,2018-10-11,42309539,Lauren,"We had a great stay. Anastasia was very responsive whenever we had questions. Location is very central in Plaka, great value!"
22190747,337043815,2018-10-15,22905052,Tanya,this place is in the best position to visit Athens. the flat is decorated nicely. if you like very hard beds and lumpy pillows this is a great find...well priced
22190747,339844865,2018-10-22,218194576,Anders,Trevlig lägenhet med bästa tänkbara läge och tyst på nätterna...
22190747,342640081,2018-10-29,172721857,Marina,"Very good location and the apartment matches the pictures exactly, but we had a few problems.<br/>The host is the owner of a clothing company, so she leaves the keys with an employee that works on a clothing store right next to the apartment, so you never see her.<br/>To start with, the apartment doesn’t have a working wifi, the host told us to connect to the store’s wifi, which goes down constantly, sometimes every 10 minutes, requiring you reconect manually and imput the password again.<br/>The other thing that was a big problem for us was the fact that the apartment does not have a shower, only a bathtub. We did not expect that, the profile on airbnb only says that the apartment has a bathtub, but we never actually thought there would be no shower in it as well.<br/>Overall we enjoyed the city, and apartment’s location helped a lot with that. Nevertheless we didn’t have a very pleasant experience inside the apartment, because of the issues listed above."
22190747,345473953,2018-11-05,37204550,Maria,"Hemos estado mis padres y yo en este apartamento 5 noches. Apartamento amplio pero viejo, deteriorado. La recogida de las llaves la tienes que hacer en la tienda que hay debajo del apartamento. La tienda pertenece a los dueños del apartamento. En ningun momento hay un encuentro con el anfitrion.  A pesar de ello, la respuesta es rapida y parecen cercanos. Tuvimos que pedirles unas sabanas mas para la cama y nos las proporcionaron tan pronto como pudieron.<br/>Primera sensación del apartamento mala. Segun entras al portal huele muchisimo a gas-oil; y la puerta del apartamento la cual se encuentra junto al ascensor no da seguridad. A pesar de tener dos cerraduras solo una funciona, o al menos solo te dan la llave de una cerradura (pedimos la otra y la respuesta fue que no existe). Una vez entras en el apartamento tambien hay varias cosas que impresiona. No es tan nuevo como parece en las fotos. Muebles deteriorados o viejos, falta de menaje de cocina (dificil cocinar y comer), falta de armarios y lugares para dejar la ropa. Solo se puede colgar ropa, todo lo que no se pueda colgar debe quedarse dentro de la maleta. Conclusion, incomodo si sois más de dos personas puesto que no hay espacio para dejar la ropa que no se puede colgar en ningun lado. El armario de la habitacion esta lleno de cosas (usado de trastero de la casa) con lo cual colgar ropa es una mision dificil, por falta de perchas por un lado (fuimos a su tienda a pedir mas y nos dieron) y porque no queda demasiado espacio (huele muchisimo a polvo por dentro). <br/>Eso si, UBICACION EXCELENTE."
22190747,355894621,2018-12-06,71360926,Christian,"Ubicación inmejorable, en centro de Plaka a 10 minutos de cualquier sitio andando, uno de los mejores barrios para ubicarse en Atenas, difícil de aparcar en la zona. Se puede mejorar los colchones, almohadas, persianas de las habitaciones y el equipamiento de la cocina"
22190747,357917169,2018-12-12,66392529,Vahri,"This is a special place! The apartment is stylish and central, and check-in was seamless. Location is on a central and yet quiet street in a buzzing district. I wish we’d stayed longer."
22190747,366051848,2019-01-02,14667510,Susanne,"The appartment is the perfect location to discover Athens. In the middle of the old city center you reach everything by walking. The appartment is on the raised ground floor, so that you can see the small and cosy street where it is located. We visited Athens in winter, so please be aware that at that time the building is not very much heated. Air condition and electric heating help a lot. But don't expect a cosy winter hideaway. For warmer temperatures the appartment is just perfect. We can highly recommend Anastasia as a host. The communication and check-in process was very uncomplicated."
22190747,401853275,2019-01-16,151472243,Haotian,Nice apartment with fully equiped facilities.<br/>location fantastic!

22190747,454359366,2019-05-18,21910749,Lynnette,The apartment is located at the perfect place! Just minutes from all the key sites and popular restaurants.
22190747,455826169,2019-05-20,74584108,ChiaYee,Pros:<br/>- excellent location in the middle of Plaka<br/>- clean place <br/>- good working WiFi <br/>- very responsive host with messages <br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- very hard bed with hard pillows <br/>- no shower gel/shampoo<br/>- place is right across a Taverna so it was very noisy at night with people standing outside smoking and talking
22190747,456717255,2019-05-22,62520879,Shauna,Beautiful apartment in a perfect location. Rooms are big and airy and the place was absolutely spotless when we arrived. Any queries we had the host replied to promptly and comprehensively. Would definitely recommend
22190747,457391340,2019-05-24,57196097,Eva,"Location is great, just 7 mins walk to accropolis museum.  You could find a lot of souvenirs shops and supermarket nearby."

22190747,460026514,2019-05-28,109182056,Magaly,"Finding the apartment and key was somewhat difficult the first night we arrived but once we found it, everything was perfect. Anastasia was responsive and provided my husband and I with exactly what we needed to spend a few nights in Athens. The location is perfect. Was a 5-15 minute walk to all the local attractions and plenty of places for shopping and food nearby. I’m recommend this listing."
22190747,460745326,2019-05-30,111027112,Sabrina,Perfect place for 2 nights stay in the Plaka district of Athens. Location is close to shopping and restaurants. There is a restaurant directly across the alley from this place so expect a little noise. Was not too bad though. Anastasia was very responsive and helpful with recommendations for places to eat. Would stay again if in Athens!
22190747,468282844,2019-06-12,44836016,Lea & Tas,"The apartment was great and suited our needs.Fantastic location, communication with owner was very good. The only downfalls were no air con in master bedroom, washing machine non existant apart from this little contraption  in the bathroom that wouldn't fit a pair of jeans in it and mattress not that comfortable. Would definitely come back if these were updated."
22190747,469814715,2019-06-15,21658090,Phoebe,"I had never been to Athens before, and chose this place hoping for a good location. I couldn’t have dreamed HOW good the location was.  It was right in Plaka, on a little side street that was quiet and easy to access. <br/>The apartment itself was simple, but with some cool lights and a swing chair in the living room. <br/>The kitchen was equipped for some basic needs but not especially stocked for in-home food prep - which was fine. <br/>The beds and pillows were hard and not especially comfortable, but after hiking to the Acropolis in 95 degree heat, we didn’t care. <br/>We had some trouble figuring out the shower, but Anastasia answered my email within 3 minutes and helped us solve the problem. She was also very responsive and friendly in the planning phase, which I appreciated. <br/>We would definitely stay there again!"
22190747,476805323,2019-06-27,96831833,Katarina,Fantastic location with most of the attractions in walking distance. <br/>Kitchen equipment is very basic. It was ok for us since we went out to eat every day - a lot of great restaurants are close by.<br/>Washing machine is a joke - it wouldn't even fit a pair of shorts.
22190747,478853440,2019-06-30,195134850,Mary,Great location and great unit. Thank you.
22190747,482168799,2019-07-06,192493494,David,"The location and apartment are great for visiting Athens with a family.  Plenty of room in the apartment, air conditioning is quiet and very effective, plenty of hot water, and despite being in a very touristy area, the place was pretty quiet.  Having separate rooms for parents and kids was great for managing kids' earlier bedtime.  Can't complain about the apartment and location, really nice.  Also the host was great in communicating an apology for what looks like a logistical screw-up on her side (see below), not any sort of negligence.<br/><br/>However, we had a bunch of problems:<br/><br/>* Wifi wasn't great.  A bit of an adventure, really.  Host tried to be helpful in suggesting in rebooting the access point but that didn't help.<br/><br/>* No sheets on the master bedroom bed the first night (really the second, see below).  Part of the logistical issue, presumably.  Host also was apologetic and got things straightened out the next day.<br/><br/>* Huge cockroaches seemed to show-up one at a time each night (bizarre how it was one, and exactly one each night).  We tried covering the bathroom floor drain, the tub drain and finally on the last night noticed that there was a small portal in the bathroom that wasn't quite closed tight -- might have been the source.  We did not bring this up with the host, perhaps we should have because she was very attentive to any questions we had.  In any case, the place was very clean so it's hard to say why the roaches were there.<br/><br/>* The really big problem alluded to above was that after confirming (far ahead of time) that we'd arrive late, we ended-up without a key in the lockbox when we arrived at midnight.  We had to find another place to stay that first night, no easy task when arriving in a new-to-us foreign country in the middle of the night.  Fortunately our kids are experienced travelers and they handled the situation well.  Still, this is the sort of thing that we feared when we started using Airbnb a year ago.  The host immediately refunded our first night and was very apologetic.<br/><br/>To summarize, great location, really nice apartment for families, some small annoyances, and one big problem.  Honestly I'd consider the place again for a future visit because I think the host was earnest and honest in trying to do right by us (and was helpful in general) and you can't beat the location."
22190747,484590845,2019-07-09,53230539,Nicholas,Such an amazing location!
22190747,486076506,2019-07-12,116266912,Maria,Perfect location! Perfect for a family and no noise as well. The wifi connection was really bad at times; that was the only downfall.
22190747,487712941,2019-07-14,44245162,Beatrice,"Bad experience. We arrived at 2 am in the night and the keys were not in the locker!<br/>Without the keys we could not access the property and had to find a hotel.<br/>However, we appreciated the fact that the host tried to help us finding another accommodation."
22190747,489582531,2019-07-17,153710476,Kirsten,Perfect location in Athens!! Loved staying there. Very loud outside in the evening however the owner has no control over this. Limited kitchen amenities however the food is too good and too reasonable to resist in the surrounding streets.

22190747,494890211,2019-07-25,9380971,Jean-Philippe,"Appartement très bien situé, proche de toutes les attractions touristiques, en plein coeur de Plaka. On peut tout faire à pied, même avec des enfants. Un supermarché se trouve en bas de l'immeuble. L'appartement est fonctionnel et climatisé. Nous étions 5, le lit double et les 2 lits simples sont très bien, le canapé était moins confortable. La petite machine à laver est bien pratique pour une famille. Nous le conseillons vivement !"
22190747,496992570,2019-07-28,27412695,Eden,Outstanding location. 6 minutes walk to the Acropolis museum. Self-check-in was simple as can be.
22190747,503494927,2019-08-06,61996539,Sophie,"L’appartement  est idéalement situé dans Athènes, à deux pas de l’acropole et en plein cœur du quartier de Plaka. Nous avons pu nous rendre à pied sur tous nos lieux de visite. Nous n’avons pas rencontré Anastasia, mais la communication avec elle s’est faite sans encombre, tout était bien expliqué. L’appartement est joliment décoré, plutôt spacieux, mais il faut savoir que le salon et la chambre sur l’avant sont assez bruyantes (quartier animé le soir). A savoir aussi: les matelas des lits sont extrêmement fermes! Certains apprécieront peut-être?"

Its is in the centre of Athens and closer of everything as restaurants, bars, Acropolis, museums and other monuments. If I come back to Athens I would choose the same appartment. Nothing to complain and I will recomend it to all my friends that are willing to go there."
22190747,518692804,2019-08-27,147232230,Oliver,Really nice communication with Anastasia - and the location of the apartment is fantastic! Everything is within walking distance.
22190747,520912331,2019-08-31,6767583,Steve,The best guide of a good BnB experience is whether I would say again and I absolutely would. The location in Plaka is phenomenal and the space available for the price certainly outweighed the negatives (which were minimal). Being able to walk out the door and having so many options within metres was great. Negatives were that it was a bit noisy outside (though there is a back room that is quiet but not air conditioned) and the wifi wasn’t that great. Self-check in was very easy.
22190747,523289027,2019-09-03,14196101,Tatiana,Great location and Anastasia was always available. We really enjoy our stay.

Det var nemt at lave mad selv og det er centralt. <br/>Vi var dog lidt uheldige mht. lidt larm om natten og fra renovering på etagen over os. Hyggeligt med badekar. Dog var der mange myrer og sengen var hård. Dejligt, at alt var i gåafstand. Venlige og hjælpsomme piger i butikken under lejligheden."

22190747,537188639,2019-09-28,3447088,Mankica,"Anastasia's place has an ideal location in the heart of old Athens. We absolutely loved how everything is within walking distance and how close all the places worth visiting are. During our stay the little alley where the apartment is located was quiet. Even the tavern across was quiet at night, so we slept very well on the comfortable beds. <br/>The apartment is spacious and cozy. Although you don't see it on the photographs, this apartment has two charming little balconies with lots of greens.  We had a late check-in, which went smooth thanks to the clear instructions that Anastasia sent us. She was also very responsive and helped us with some small problems that we encountered when we arrived in Athens. She also provided us with useful information about where to leave our luggage on the last day. This place is definitely your perfect safe haven in this historical center of Athens."
22190747,539448001,2019-10-01,243930311,Blanka,Great Place!
22190747,543730491,2019-10-08,2374739,Graeme,Perfect position. We loved sitting on the balcony with a glass of wine. Great place.
22190747,546939549,2019-10-14,2049054,Dominic,"We had a splendid time in Athens, and were surprised to see that the city is still crowded in October! I guess that could have been a lot worse!<br/><br/>Anastasia's place is extremely well located, very close to all main attractions, just by walking around in the pedestrian areas, very hard to beat location. We didn't meet, but she explained everything in details and we had no trouble checking in or out.<br/><br/>Few things about the apartment to take in consideration though :<br/>- The location comes at at price: there is a bar in front of the apartment and people coming in or out laughing can be quite noisy until late in the night (though the sound doesn't go to the master's bedroom, just to the one with the window on the street). And it ain't just the bar, we were surprised by a marching band on Adrianou at midnight that woke us all up! It ain't bad as long as you look for action!<br/>- The internet speed ain't high: I did some tests and it never went over 500 Kbps, if you just use the wifi to prepare your day, it doesn't have a big impact but I usually work at night and I had some trouble. No big deal but forget about streaming music or movies.<br/>- The place is a bit tight for families: the kitchen table isn't suited for a meal, nor are the little stools (no chairs), we didn't realize before booking, that's completely on us. More restaurants try outs (and they are literally meters away, but use trip advisor or other review sites as some are total tourists ripoffs)!<br/>- the beds are on the harder side of firm: some comments already said the beds were hard, and we like it like that, but in the masters bedroom we could feel the actual matress frame and springs, that was quite uncomfortable, we had to had extra blankets under us to be able to sleep...<br/><br/>Please understand I state those things so travelers are fully aware, we still do feel the place has a lot of merit and is a very good choice for most people.<br/>Have a nice trip!"
22190747,553069227,2019-10-23,93686423,Denis,"Appartement conforme aux photos. Dans le quartier populaire, près de tout et facile d'accès. On a très apprécié notre séjour."
22190747,553930806,2019-10-25,54475340,Idaleen,Awesome location! Very quaint apartment with everything you need. Communication was excellent and would definitely stay there again!
22190747,559460148,2019-11-04,227694552,Jonathan Mark,"This apartment is by far one of the best places I have stayed in. The location is perfect with short walking distances to all the major restaurants, tourists sites and main shopping high streets. <br/><br/>The apartment itself was very cool and quirky. The amenities were perfect and exactly what we needed. The area is very vibrant, we were spoilt for choice on what to do, where to eat and where to shop. When I come back to Athens, will be booking this place again."
22190747,563551107,2019-11-13,204581415,Harry,"Excellent stay, lovely place for a couple/small family, group of friends. Simple, effective, good value for money and above all, the best location, 20 seconds from a supermarket, and literally yards from a whole host of local bars, restaurants, acropolis and more. This review really is as good as it sounds and the only way to find out is to book! Would definitely stay again!"
22190747,582558334,2019-12-27,254946667,Lenka,The location of the apartment is simply perfect. Right in the centre of Plaka and within 10 minutes walking distance from anywhere.<br/><br/>We've had slightly different expectations from the photos about the interior but once we got to live there we found the apartment cosy. <br/><br/>The location is in a side street with a taverna and a theatre. This had caused a couple of disturbed nights sleep. But if you're into the hustle and bustle it mugt be just the place for you.
22190747,587467611,2020-01-03,266797278,Manon,"De lokatie van dit apartement is perfect! Alles is op loopafstand  te doen : winkelen in het centrum of juist in de toeristische straatjes die direct in de omgeving zitten. Ook een uitje naar de Akropolis of de andere archeologische bezienswaardigheden  is te voet goed te doen. De supermarkt zit echt letterlijk om de hoek. En in de directe omgeving zitten ook onwijs veel restaurantjes. <br/>Voor degenen die van een wat harder bed houden,  is dit een prima keuze. Persoonlijk had ik liever een wat zachter matras gehad. Maar dat is natuurlijk een individuele keuze. Wel luxe dat er twee aparte slaapkamers zijn."

22190747,646835275,2020-08-05,358852580,Robert,The apartment is in a great location when it comes to exploring Athens and has excellent transport links. It is also good value for money and Anastasia responds very quickly to any queries.

22190747,704104941,2020-10-26,127161083,Anne-Fleur,"Location is perfect. Nice street and super central! You can walk everywhere.<br/>The appartment is ready for an upgrade. The shower wasn't great, there was no shower curtain and also no holder to put the shower head, so you had to hold it in your hands. That isn't nice to shower. The 'washingmachine' was not really a washingmachine but more a handwash machine. The matrass of the bed is old, you feel the springs.<br/>In the end we didn't cook because the dishes weren't very clean, a bit sticky. And the jar with cutlery wasn't clean either.<br/>We did find a cockroach during our stay in de second bedroom, but luckily just one!<br/>Anastasia is very helpful and fast in communication :) - there are several travel books of Athens in the appartment. Very nice! <br/>If you stay here for a long weekend as a city trip its perfect, you don't need more, but if you stay longer, you should pick another appartment.<br/>The location is AMAZING!"
22190747,768836201,2021-06-11,284543663,Esther,"We stayed there for 2 months and Anastasia has been the most amazing Airbnb host we've ever had! She is very kind and always there to help. In addition, the appartement is perfectly located in Athens under the Accropolis. Also, the appartement is clean and well equiped. If you want a perfect stay in Athens, you should go there!"
22190747,388825134957324771,2021-06-20,5325623,Carmina,"If you want a centrally located spot, this is it. You are so close to everything yet, it is also in a quiet area. We did notice a Taverna right across the apartment but they were closed so I’m not sure if it does get loud when that place is open. Be prepared to hold your own shower head. We didn’t have soap to wash hands. Also, the washer is very very small. You can maybe fit your under garments. The  beds are not comfortable but it a place to sleep in. The kitchen has everything you need to do basic cooking if needed. Anastasia was very responsive and provided us with the support we needed. She even let us check in early because our flight landed a lot earlier than what our tickets said. Overall, comfort to sleep wasn’t great but the price and the location make up for it."
22190747,393896661627362615,2021-06-27,327401630,Andre,"Anastasia was very prompt and did a great job assisting us.  The location of this apartment is FANTASIC!! We were very close 1 minute walk to many restaurants, local shopping markets, and a few minute walk to several main attractions.   It is even a close 8 minute walk to the CitySightseeing Hop-on-Hop-off Bus (near the McDonalds).  We will stay here again in the future (if we are lucking enough to book it).  Snag it now, get out an walk around Athens to see the things, then use the Hop-on-Hop-off for the more distant attracts.  Also, Anastasia was very helpful in assisting us in booking a ferry to one of the islands for a visit to our next destination.  A+"

He had tea and honey there which was nice to have before bed. Just a note! Our taxi driver took us to Kallithea to the same address so just be mindful you show them the athina part of the address. Aris was very patient and helped up sort ourselves out and waited to check us in! Wish we could have stayed longer, the area seemed full of cafes and restaurants"

Aris is a fab host and provided us loads of great tips on arrival. He even let us check in early which we really appreciated. The studio itself is soo cosy, my partner and I did not have a single bad night. Bonus points for the incredible shampoo, my hair loved it! Thank you Aris! Highly recommended!"

We really wished we could have stayed longer, his flat was very nice, stylish and perfect for what we needed. It was easy to get to via the Metro, we also really liked the area and wished we could have explored more. If we make it back to Athens we would definitely stay here again. "

Estuve en contacto con Aris vía (Hidden by Airbnb) y me envió fotos y vídeos con indicaciones muy claras ya que llegábamos de madrugada. Volvería a alojarme aquí. Al ser tres huéspedes, una de ellas debió dormir en el sillón y realmente era muy incómodo.. recomendado para dos personas! "

Upon our arrival he took the time to show us around the apartment and opened up a map for us to show areas of interest and gave suggestions. The apartment was just what 2 travelers needed. Nothing more or less was needed. Very clean and smelled brand new. The location of the apartment was within minutes walking distance to places to eat, transportation and attractions. We highly recommend!"

22204107,322828251,2018-09-14,142580292,Luca,"Aris has a great location in the heart of Athens. 15 min walking are enough to bring you between the ancient Agorà and the Akropolis, but if you are extra-lazy the tube is 100 meters from the apartment. The flat is cute with new furnitures. With one room more, it will be perfect."

22204107,339831675,2018-10-22,6132886,Helena,"Great host, great location! If you travel alone or not familiar with Athens, it's really important to stay in such a neighbourhood that feels lively, relaxing, completely cosmopolitan and yet safe (that combination seems to be rare in Athens). The apartment is charming, modern, well-equipped and cozy, with beautiful entrance. Lovely rerstaurants, bars, a typical Greek bakery, a pancake cafe and a small shop nearby. Metro and bus station few minutes from the doorstep (I recommend using metro, few minutes drive to Acropolis or Syntagma with Ermou street). Aris is friendly, well mannered and takes his time to explain you everything you need to know."

The location is great for visiting the Acropolis, and in a cool local neighborhood with easy transport links plus lots of great little restaurants just nearby. The flat is clean, and some very thoughtful touches to make the stay comfortable. My last morning there was some loud noise from some repairs on the building, but I think this is not the normal here, it may be just once in a while. Basically a very good value, strategically located spot, and I would stay again."
22204107,346540955,2018-11-09,29883947,Anastasis,The place was very nice and as the pictures indicated.

Σε οποιοδήποτε ζήτημα μου απάντησε άμεσα με μήνυμα από την πλατφόρμα του Airbnb και είχα και την δυνατότητα να τον πάρω τηλέφωνο για οποιοδήποτε θέμα. Θα ξαναδιάλεγα το συγκεκριμένο χώρο γιατί ήταν πολύ κοντά στο κέντρο και παρείχε όλες τις ανέσεις. Επιπλέον, είχε καφετίερα εσπρέσσο και κάψουλες για να φτιάξω καφέ, κάτι το οποίο δεν πέριμενα!!!!"

Every time we heated up the water for shower, it was only enough for one person, but maybe because we took shower too slowly . Aris replyed quickly."
22204107,443047743,2019-04-25,128144512,Marcel,"It is a nice little appartement, perfect for a short leave or a stay over in Athens. You reach the Akropolis within 8 minutes of walking."
22204107,444705620,2019-04-28,242205626,Renee,Aris was very accommodating. I loved that the apartment is super close to the metro and the acropolis! It was a really good size apartment unfortunately we could only stay for 1 night but I would definitely recommend.
22204107,446737762,2019-05-02,47655865,Julia,Appartement is perfect!<br/>It's a very cozy and very comfortable room. Everything you need inside. <br/>Aris is very reactive to message and communication was easy. <br/>If we come back in athenes we ll definitely book again. <br/>Thanks!
22204107,449258043,2019-05-06,104506949,Alison,"Arrivée 3h du matin dans Athènes après un retard de vol, Aris avait envoyé des photos pour trouver facilement l’appartement et la boîte à clé.<br/>Appartement propre avec tout le nécessaire, deco sympa, idéal pour un couple ou une personne seule, localisation parfaite, à 2 pas de l’Acropole, du tram et du métro, mais sans l’agitation qu’on peut trouver 500 m plus loin. Just go !"
22204107,453546484,2019-05-16,225490511,Kylie,"The location was amazing! About a 10 minute walk to a lot of shops and restaurants, about 15 minutes from the Acropolis. The place was the perfect size for two people and the self-checkin was very convenient."
22204107,456691035,2019-05-22,8337105,Mina,"Pros: location, very convenient and walkable to most major attractions. Great restaurant down the street called Kalamaki Bar, supermarket down the street, spacious living room for luggage. Quick responses from host. <br/><br/>Cons: Bathroom could use a thorough cleaning, the shower floor is uneven so it leaves a puddle of standing water which was unpleasant stepping into when we wanted to shower, it’s a very small bathroom, and hot water runs out very quickly, maybe after 10 mins, then you have to turn the water heater on and wait about 30 mins for it to heat up again. WiFi was non-existent,  very very slow. street level location so very loud, no AC so couldn’t shut the window. Bed is very firm but some people might like that. <br/><br/>In other words, you get what you pay for."

The location was great, being very close to Sygrou Fix metro station, as well as to restaurants and supermarkets. The kitchen amenities were very good. We found the host to be very responsive to all our queries, and we really appreciated his letting us leave a suitcase at the apartment while we traveled out of Athens for a few days. All in all, a very pleasant stay."
22204107,471175070,2019-06-17,74890591,Marie-Pierre,"We were only there for one night because we had trouble with our hotel so we booked the night before! We didn’t meet Aris but he was very nice and the communication was great! We replied very quickly and gave us all the informations for our arrival. Everything went perfectly and the apartment was very well located. Loved it, thank you :)"
22204107,474516809,2019-06-23,43505545,Frederikke,"Cosy apartment with nice location close to many sights and restaurants. However, the building/area was quite nosy, which made it difficult to get a good nights sleep."

22204107,503621648,2019-08-06,9982303,이슬,혼자 쓰기에 좋아요. 둘까지도 쓸 수 있을 것 같아요. 에어컨 없다고 나와서 걱정했는데 에어컨 있어요!  위치도 좋아서 지하철 트롤레이 타기도 좋고 걸어다니기도 괜찮아요. 세탁기가 없는 거 하나만 아쉬웠고 다 좋았어요!:)

Si trova in una zona centrale, a due passi dall'Acropoli e dal Museo dell'Acropoli e vicino a molti ristoranti. Abbiamo contattato Aris durante il soggiorno e la sua risposta é arrivata dopo pochissimo. Sistemazione consigliata!"

22204107,528998282,2019-09-14,279927797,Lakshmi,"The apartment is a 10min walk from the Acropoli metro station. The location is convenient for shopping, sightseeing, food etc. However, the neighbourhood is a little modern with high rise buildings (residential and commercial) on both sides of narrow 1-way streets. So, if you are looking for as traditional Greek type living this is not the apartment for you as such are typically a little away from the<br/>main city centre.<br/><br/>It is a studio apartment with 1 big and 1 small bed, a dinning table<br/>with 4 chairs, a small refrigerator and a kitchenette. There were few<br/>items like salt, oil etc but tea/coffee were not provided eventhough there were empty containers with the these labels on them..There were 2 bottles of water in the refrigerator – 1 already opened and another<br/>was in a glass bottle, obviously refilled (no idea from where). There was also a half bottle of coca cola. We didn’t bother touching any of this as it seemed it had not been cleared after the previous guest had stayed. So, we ended up buying our own bottled water and fruit juices from the supermarkets nearby. The bathroom was small but manageable, however, the shower<br/>area was really tiny. Bath water did not drain properly leaving a<br/>small puddle within the shower area. There was no soap in the hand wash container, but there were shower gels and shampoos provided. The queen size bed had four posts on it that weren’t fixed well. It shook and swung even if you touched or held it. I was afraid it would fall on us but thankfully it didn’t.<br/><br/>Overall the room seemed clean but a little old. It was more fancy than functional."
22204107,530696348,2019-09-16,152443926,An,"Aris is a perfect host, responsible and caring. Thanks a lot for all the help! Highly recommended"
22204107,533274556,2019-09-21,4511417,Rachele,The apartment is located in a strategic position to explore the city center and the main attractions by walking distance. And Athens is super cool!
22204107,543703230,2019-10-08,257419342,Marco,"L’alloggio è in una posizione ottima, a 5 minuti dall’acropoli e ancora più vicino alla metropolitana. <br/>Abbiamo trovato l’appartamento molto pulito e ben arredato, curato nei dettagli. <br/>L’host è molto gentile e disponibile."
22204107,559949973,2019-11-05,27260658,Kouvaritakis,"The apartment is renovated and very well located in the city center, close to many attraction points.<br/>It's a pity though because it seems that this apartment doesn't have the attention that is needed,maybe Aris hasn't checked his apartment lately and his absence is quite obvious. <br/>The bed is about to break, we got really lucky that it didn't break during our stay.<br/>In the shelfs at the bathroom were some leftovers shampoo from previous guests and the bottle with the shower gel that it was actually for us , was empty.<br/>The closet was full with cleaning staff and mattresses so we didn't have any place to hang our clothes.<br/>The quality of linen is the worst we found some holes.<br/>We got in the apartment one hour later than the time that Aris told us , which is ok comparing to the other."
22204107,562623635,2019-11-11,199240259,Alejandro,The location of the apartment is fantastic.  For 1 or 2 people it is perfect.  The only problem with the apartment is that the shower is a bit awkward.  Aris responds quickly. :)
22204107,563818905,2019-11-14,160137030,Greg,Great location and very clean inside. Perfect for an individual or couple traveling through Athens.

22204107,567676528,2019-11-23,54652145,Nikos,The place was very clean and in a very good location that you can easily reach metro or Koukaki area. However the photos make it look a bit better than it really is. For example the shower is awkwardly small. But its a very good option if you want just a place in a good location. The communication with Aris was excellent. Thanks a lot
22204107,571358811,2019-12-01,22362762,Violaine,"The apartment is very nice and super clean, it’s very close to the metro and to the city center. The neighborhood is really nice and calm. I would come back to Ari’s place any time if I come back to Athens. <br/><br/>The apartment is best for a single person or a couple, and there is everything you need. The shower system takes a bit of time to get used to, but I think it added to the charm of staying in Athens!"
22204107,573439800,2019-12-06,7213511,Janet,"Adorable studio. About a 15, 20 min walk to Plaka but doable. Great locals neighborhoid with plenty of shops and non-tourist prices. Neighbors are fabulous! I would def rebook."

Definitely good for tourists who want tome near the antiquities and walk around the Acropolis area. <br/>It is on the first floor on a busy street so feels safe but also more noisy. <br/>I would recommend a change of the mattress and closet so as it feels more new, as well as the entrance door. Last, I would recommend more towels, we were given only 1 for each person (no face or hand towel)."

Right at the foot of Lycabettus Hill with sweeping views of everything!  Looked amazing online-even BETTER in person!  We had to force ourselves to leave to explore the city-the views are breath-taking and everything about the apartment is perfectly appointed and sparkling clean.  Views of the Acropolis, the Olympic Stadium, the city and the sea.  I can't imagine anything better.  Really.  Do not hesitate to book this air bnb.  Immediately.  I would not even consider another location when in Athens."

It is very conveniently located in the hip Kolonaki area and no more than a short stroll away from the hustle and bustle of the centre of town. Hospitality, including directions, check-in, check-out and speed of communications has been absolutely spotless. I couldn't recommend this place more, especially if, like us, you happen to be a couple in search of a romantic hideaway in a busy city. What a wonderful weekend that was! Thank you so, so much!"

It was renovated recsntly so clean and modern. Nice veiw out there. You can see almost every Athenes view there.  It is located uphill so you better to rent a car or take a taxi. Athene road is narrow so taking a taxi is etential.

22218431,252540065,2018-04-11,167138446,Elina,"We didn't expect a lot from our host, as this was our first time using an Airbnb space. However, Aliki and her daughter were amazing hosts. They replied to our msgs within 10 minutes and reminded us how great the Greek hospitality is. We felt that the flat was owned by family. They checked on us regularly and even contacted us before arriving in case we needed something for our baby daughter.<br/><br/>The flat is newly renovated, stylish and most importantly VERY clean! Hotel standard towels and linen and well equipped kitchen. And what can I say about the stunning view; the best spot to have a flat in Athens!  Waking up and seeing that view was the best part of our holidays. Book this flat and you will not regret it!<br/><br/>Thank you Aliki and Christina. This was our first holidays after having our daughter and a trip to celebrate our birthdays, and you made it very special:)"
22218431,253316693,2018-04-14,16871964,Jerry,"Great views over Athens from the hill top. Great street market just 50m away, easy access to the old town etc, parking space proved handy for us. <br/><br/>Apartment is just stupendous, and exactly what one would like to have for a home. Toilets are great. cooking area is functional and stylish. Space is just TOO LARGE - but who is complaining? <br/><br/>Would have loved to spend more time in the Apartment, except for the sights around Athens.<br/><br/>This is really a great place to stay."
22218431,255059684,2018-04-19,94773587,Jane,"Absolutely amazing apartment. Alikis daughter gave us a very warm welcome. The apartment is in a great location, though on a hill, it’s very quiet but only a short walk to bars and restaurants. We loved the loungers on the balcony and make good use of them in the sunshine enjoying the spectacular views of the Acropolis. There was essentials in the fridge, milk, eggs etc. The apartment was spotless, had everything we needed and more. Thank you Aliki for a wonderful stay."
22218431,256964564,2018-04-24,66045070,Alain,"Aliki was an exceptional host with a wonderful property.  Wonderful, helpful communication made this a great Athens/Kolonaki/Lycabettus stay."
22218431,257728268,2018-04-27,2070183,Scott,"Aliki’s two story penthouse apartment was our first stop on a honeymoon and first time to Athens.  After getting acquainted with Athens for two days, we realized the location is perfect. Down street to the right is wonderful outdoor cafe which we visited every morning for coffee. A little further and to left was our favorite street in Athens. All so close yet still away from crowds, traffic & noise. The apartment is stylish, modern, clean, every amenity.  The apartment is two stories with expansive balconies overlooking the most beautiful view imaginable.  A private elevator takes you directly to the apartment. Aliki & her daughter even provided eggs, bread, coffee, soap, etc.Aliki’s daughter was easy to reach and very pleasant, nice & helpful.  Was fantastic start to our honeymoon."
22218431,262479950,2018-05-09,34731184,Paul,"This place and Host ( Aliki) were Amazing. Very clean and modern apartment. Its proximity to all central Athens activities was spot  on.  We felt safe and well taken care of. Parking on premises was excellent as we traveled all over Greece. Oh and the view of the Acropolis was breathtaking and it was at the base entrance of the Lecabitus wit even more spectacular views.  You will be pleased with everything about this place and Host. Look no further, this is it. Book it and be happy."
22218431,263882640,2018-05-13,82708778,Nidhi,"This place had an amazing view! It was very clean. Its actually about 15-20 min walk to the acropolis but the view of it from the terrace is beautiful at night! The view of the city is amazing from bed. Great way to start the day. The only thing about this place is there is no microwave and the stove doesn't work so I suggest you eat out and not bring back leftovers because it will be tough to re heat them. Other than that, this was a great place! Highly recommend it. The host was very prompt in getting back to any questions we had. She was very helpful."

22218431,266029333,2018-05-19,125825915,Tom,"This is a really nice property and a good value, and especially located in a good location.  Conveniently located within 15-30 mins walk of most all the tourist sights of Athens, it also has the unique feature of being located in a residential area that is quiet, with little chic cafes (Queen Bee was our favorite) and bars within a 5 min walk.  As if that wasn’t enough, our hostess Aliki went above and beyond by helping us secure dinner reservations at a couple restaurants (Taverna Fillipou was our favorite, just a 5 minute walk away)."
22218431,267023975,2018-05-21,92273248,Niran,This place was really amazing. The two story penthouse was very modern with great amenities and had two spectacular terrace views. The place is also in a very nice area of Athens with lots of good restaurants within walking distance. Finally our host Aliki was so welcoming and prompt with communication. I typically had a response within a minute and she provided so many great local recommendations as well. Thank you!
22218431,268233818,2018-05-24,39890236,Mick,"First this property is way better than it looks. Under promised and over achieves. Aliki was as prompt and accommodating to the point of a 5 star facility. I was arriving at a very early hour on a Monday and she made sure I had transportation from  airport right to the front door. Penthouse is immaculate top to bottom. She makes sure someone is available for any needs you might have, and responds to those needs immediately. View is as pure as it gets. I have reffed my whole family to enjoy the environment she has created, and is sharing with the world. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.!!!$$$"
22218431,270389969,2018-05-29,105914530,Michelle,"This apartment is amazing, even better than the photographs.  The host was extremely kind and helpful during check-in.  We were there over a state holiday, and she went so far as to check and get back to us letting us know the Acropolis was open on the holiday.  She gave us a great restaurant recommendation too.  I would highly recommend staying here for a spectacular experience."
22218431,272174044,2018-06-03,35518692,Natalie,I loved her place! It was a perfect location within walking distance of the metro and many places to eat. Her daughter gave us great recommendations to eat nearby and the view was spectacular. It was very comfortable and a beautiful space! I highly recommend it.

22218431,274786331,2018-06-10,19365024,Anita,Aliki’s place was spotlessly clean. The quality of the towels and sheets was good. And Aliki had stocked up the apartment with all breakfast essentials and fresh fruit. The apartment is located is a nice stylish upscale area and close to plenty of restaurants and cafes. The view us fabulous. And most importantly Aliki is always available and extremely reliable. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend Aliki’s apartment.
22218431,276208165,2018-06-13,6282972,Andrea,Terrific view of Athens!! It’s in a great neighborhood and the flat is very stylish and modern.  Aliki has everything you need here. Highly recommend.

22218431,289310820,2018-07-12,170565158,Nicolas,"If you are looking for a modern accommodation in Athens you might just found the spot. <br/><br/>The penthouse is in a quiet neighborhood and is easily accessible due to the parking spot you most definitely need in Athens if you have a car. <br/><br/>Every major sight in Athens is within walking distance from the flat and great bars and restaurants can be reached in minutes. <br/>The neighborhood offers a great variety’s for a night out even though you will have quiet nights if you would like to get some sleep. <br/><br/>Both floors of the penthouse are air-conditioned (must have in the summer in my opinion) and the flat is equipped with everything you might need. <br/><br/>Lastly, the view you will have other Athens is stunning, especially at night."
22218431,292853774,2018-07-19,123751240,Sonya,Aliki's penthouse is fabulous!  She is a great host and the place is terrific.   When we return to Greece we will definitely return.

22218431,298155113,2018-07-29,24891170,Abby,"This place can not be missed as part of your stay in Athens. The location, though high on a hill, boasts some of the best views in Athens from the comfort of your very own penthouse. <br/><br/>The air conditioning was a god-send in the blistering heat of the Athens summer. Aliki and her family friend (who showed us the place) provided us with some essentials to get us started, and pointed out anything we would need in the neighborhood. Kitchen and bathrooms were efficient (shower, amazing) and we had plenty of space for the two of us. Communication was perfect and we will definitely use this space again if (and when) we return to Athens! Thank you!! "

22218431,300468833,2018-08-02,158916696,Sam,"We loved this Penthouse. It was close to shopping and food. Even close to a nice little movie theater where we saw the new Mama Mia. On top of it, this penthouse is close to all historic sights in Athens. We were able to book a tour and see everything knowing it was close to our sleeping corridors. The hospitality was spot on. Easy to communicate and fast responses from the host. Best part is the view. Breath taking. We loved how clean everything was and how nice this place was. Overall we loved everything about it."
22218431,305211210,2018-08-11,132492727,Dennis,"The apartment is very big, clean and offers a great view over Athens. Aliki is very kind and always responds very quick."

The penthouse was amazing. The pictures don't do it justice. The two balconies were huge and the view over the city, the sea and the acropolis were unbelievable. The flat itself was spotless, big and had everything you need to relax and enjoy yourself when you're not out and about. It's in the perfect location, close to both the centre of Athens and also the metro station, the streets around the flat are also busy with bars and restaurants, and there's a great place for food and drinks almost on the doorstep next to the open air cinema. Aliki was the perfect host, leaving us the basic things in the fridge, water milk, eggs, fruit etc. Communication from her was also brilliant, and she answered any of our messages almost immediately. Thanks again Aliki for helping make our visit to Athens unforgettable we had a great time. "

22218431,319082404,2018-09-05,28199486,Wendy,"Everything about Aliki’s place was exactly as pictured and described.  The apartment is just steps away from the Mount lycabettus cable car and the Kolonaki neighborhood is littered with nice restaurants and shops. Aliki was very quick to respond to messages and our host made several great restaurant recommendations. We walked to Oikeio restaurant, just down the street, for our first meal in Greece and it did not disappoint."

A nice ""home"" touch was that our host provided a breakfast items (coffee, milk, eggs, bread and fruit) so that we did not have to really go to the market.  Eating outside on the balcony was very relaxing in the mornings."
22218431,322888126,2018-09-14,41367971,Andres,Best Airbnb I’ve stayed in. In a trendy and nice area of Athens. The host was responsive and helpful. The apartment was gorgeous. The view was amazing.

22218431,329498921,2018-09-29,164822898,James,This is a FANTASTIC penthouse - with wonderful views over Athens - especially the majestic Acropolis. <br/><br/>Aliki was a wonderful host - making all the arrangements simple - she put some daily food items in the penthouse for our arrival - which meant we did not need to get them . <br/><br/>Would throughly recommend stsying with her. <br/><br/>James
22218431,330866700,2018-10-01,12842234,David,Very nice place. Safe and quiet neighborhood. A bit of a walk to city center (15 minutes).<br/><br/>We had a difficult check in. We wanted to check in 15 minutes early so we could make a tour and it was an issue.
22218431,331954336,2018-10-04,73944026,Nadia,Thank you very much for the stay !
22218431,333424921,2018-10-07,69743559,Nicola,"We stayed in Aliki's penthouse apartment for a long weekend at the beginning of October. Aliki's communication was so responsive in the lead up to our visit. We were greeted warmly by Aliki's daughter Cristina and grandson Yanni when we arrived and shown around the apartment which was spotless. Thoughtful touches like bread, milk, ea/coffee, local honey, fruit and eggs had been left for us which made all the difference after a tiring flight.  The apartment is lovely, the photos almost do it justice but not quite. The view from both balconies is stunning, we could have stayed there watching the sunset over the Acropolis all evening but there are so many bars and tavernas within 2 mins walk that it would have been rude not to try out Aliki's spot on recommendations (great food for meat eaters and veggies alike). Most key archaeological sites are within 20 mins walk although we also used the metro which is 10 mins walk from the apartment. We had a wonderful time in Athens and will definitely return. Thank you Aliki."
22218431,335393026,2018-10-12,27146767,Sujay,"Alik’s place is spacious, well equipped, gorgeous, central and amazingly private. Aliki, was also the perfect host, very prompt to respond and with very valuable suggestions and feedback."

We were welcomed by Cristina and Yiannis who showed us around the apartment, which was spotlessly clean and everything you need for your stay. There was fresh fruit, honey, cereal, milk and bread which was a nice surprise for breakfast. The area that the apartment is located in is nice and quiet but within walking distance to all main attractions, lots of good restaurants and shops close by.<br/>Great apartment with great hosts to go with it, would stay at Alikis <br/>apartment next time we are back in Athens can’t recommend it enough."

22218431,346348035,2018-11-08,78087190,Phillip,"If there is a more beautiful space to stay the night in Athens, you would be hard pressed to find it. From the dual level balconies with their extraordinary views, to the easy walking distances of almost every imaginable amenity, this place will thrill you with it’s charm and sophistication. My wife and I walked to the acropolis, and spent an incredible day exploring the footprints of antiquity- from the Parthenon to the ancient agora- it was all breathtaking and stunning.  If you do the same, make sure you bring your appetite, and enjoy one of the many incredible restaurants near the ancient agora... the food, the views, and the people here are all amazing."
22218431,348275474,2018-11-13,29704777,Kelly,"Incredible place, with an amazing view of the Acropolis! It was amazing to have breakfast and dinner on the deck sitting over the city. I was in the city for the Marathon and found it was quiet and in a perfect location to get to all major sites by foot. Check in was seamless and the place was well appointed and stylish. One of the best AirBnb’s I’ve ever stayed in in Europe. I would defiantly return on my next visit!"
22218431,351539783,2018-11-23,82158277,Artemisa,Great place and location! Aliki was very hospitable and responsive. Definitely choose if you want to see the city of Athens!
22218431,352351504,2018-11-25,202980274,Palak,"Aliki's place is exactly as it appears in the pictures. The view from the 6th floor was amazing, we also had proper parking space available which was a major plus (since there is lack of parking space in Athens almost everywhere, which is also why we regretted hiring a car) as well the kitchen too is spacious equipped with almost everything (except for a microwave). Aliki was also kind enough to offer us some fresh fruits, milk, eggs and a packet of bread for our breakfast needs. The place was also well maintained and taken care off, perhaps the only thing I would like changed would be check out at 11am since usually everywhere the standard is 12 noon. Thanks again Aliki for the amazing stay and for being so prompt on responding to our queries at all times."

22218431,422449913,2019-03-11,41014844,Dimitrios,Πολύ όμορφο σπίτι σε φανταστική τοποθεσία ακριβώς όπως φαίνεται στις φωτογραφίες. Όμορφη πινελιά τα προϊόντα για πρωινό. Πολύ καλή και άμεση επικοινωνία. Είχαμε μια καθυστέρηση στην αναχώρηση του ταξιδιού μας και μας υποδέχθηκαν με κατανόηση τη νέα ώρα. Το συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα. Ξυπνάς με μια φανταστική θέα!!!
22218431,434990148,2019-04-09,2049164,Vicki,Aliki's penthouse was amazing.  It is located partly up Lycabettus hill in the fantastic district of  Kolonaki in central Athens.  It is very close to many attractions including the Acropolis but far enough away so it is very quiet.  The penthouse is located on the top two floors with no one living above you.  There are two very large balconies from which you have a wonderful view of the city and the Parthenon!  Just incredible.  Hard to believe you can look out of your balcony and see such a sight.  The penthouse is very big and modern. <br/> We were there a month and Aliki provided weekly cleaning and fresh towels/bedsheets.  We felt very spoiled.  There is an elevator so you don't have to walk up to her penthouse.  We locked ourselves out one day and she was very responsive to making sure we got back in.  She also was happy to provide an item that we requested.  Our experience with her Airbnb could not have been any better.
22218431,436066397,2019-04-12,51340969,Katy,"Wow! We loved this apartment. The views are even better than the photographs; you can see the sea, the Acropolis and the Mountains. It is clean and Yianni made our check-in very easy. The apartment is a 15minute walk from the top of Mount Lycabettus and we walked up there for sunset- beautiful. The area is safe and has some great bars.<br/>Katy and Doug "
22218431,437715992,2019-04-15,188190430,Michelle,"Aliki's apartment is in a cute section of downtown Athens.  Her daughter and grandson are both very pleasant people who were there when we arrived and helped us get settled in.  They gave us food for breakfast which was a nice touch.  They were responsive to questions we had about the apartment.  We utilized the washer while we were there, which was really helpful on our trip.<br/><br/>The apartment bedroom's ceiling had unfortunately sustained some water damage from an unusually rainy season in Athens, but they were upfront and apologetic about the damage and we know they are fixing it for whoever is coming next.  The only thing we wish the apartment had had were frosted windows in the shower, or blinds to cover them.<br/><br/>Thanks for our stay in Athens!!"
22218431,441562147,2019-04-22,23475766,Frank,"Fantastic views from the two balconies, close to Mount Licabetus, very clean. Supermarket and many restaurants in walking distance. Can easily be reached from the airport by metro line 3. (the last 600 meters are a bit steep, you might want to take a taxi for your suitcase..)  Calm and safe area. Strongly recommended."

And really good facilities. Really nice quiet area in Athens, close to some good restaurants and wine bars. Would thoroughly recommend"
22218431,449149886,2019-05-06,76529435,Brittany,Great apartment!  It is exactly as the pictures show!  Within walking distance of so many great cafes and shops.  We did take a cab to the Acropolis as the city itself is very big and has a lot of stairs.  Aliki was great!  Her grandson Yianni met us at the apartment and explained everything to us.  He also told us about a restaurant with awesome food!  Definitely recommend this apartment!
22218431,451097181,2019-05-11,135674306,Angelos,"Aliki is very responsive, the house view is stunning. Everything was perfect"

22218431,456334955,2019-05-21,41515564,Alison,"Aliki's place is AMAZING! I would absolutely recommend. The location is really good, just a short walk to the train station and a short walk to grocery store and a ton of restaurants. Yianni showed us into the place and he was awesome. They are very friendly people!"
22218431,459273053,2019-05-27,71570217,Justin,"Amazing location with an even more amazing views of the city.  The apartment itself was very spacious and clean.  The extra touches they added such as providing breakfast items was perfect for getting the days started- eggs, milk, bread, butter, cereal, coffee,  fresh fruit, etc.  Make sure to check out Mount Lycabettus which is barely a 5 minute walk from the apartment- at the top has even more incredible views of the city."
22218431,461676026,2019-06-01,10847193,Maksim,Aliki’s place is in a great neighborhood with a cue to die for. She is great in responding to all questions very quickly. Don’t hesitate just book this place!

Reasonable walking distance to everything and a short walk to Mount Lycabettus, which we highly recommend going for dinner & the sunset! Our host was amazing! They left us food for breakfast and when we had an issue with the shower drain, they communicated quickly and had it fixed the very next day!"
22218431,473653209,2019-06-22,8129716,Olga,"Modern, open, and stylish are the first impressions of this apartment in Kolonaki. Very close access to the sights, public transportation, and numerous restaurants/cafes make Aliki’s apartment the perfect location for a stay in Athens. She is an extraordinary host."

Unfortunately there was an incident in the neighborhood that gave us a bit of a scare (not the hosts fault in any way) but other than that it was a nice stay."

22218431,499878574,2019-08-01,2345061,Christophe,"Très agréable séjour dans un quartier à privilégier pour son calme et sa proximité de l'hyper centre. Idéal pour un séjour familial. Le taxi reste le moyen de déplacement le plus pratique à Athènes, réservation proposée sur Uber et il est possible d'atteindre les centres archéologiques pour moins de 5€. Accès à la piscine d'un hôtel à proximité moyennant réservation payante mais appréciable pour parents et enfant de faire une pause d'une demi journée sans visite...<br/>Aliki et sa famille ont été disponibles pour faciliter notre séjour. Le kit ""premier petit-déjeuner"" quand nous sommes arrivés (un dimanche) était bien appréciable. Les produits de base (café, thé, huile, vinaigre, sel, poivre, les produits de toilette et les produits d'entretien) étaient aussi à disposition. Bien appréciable.<br/>Merci de votre très bon accueil, nous reviendrons sans hésitation."

If you’re looking for these things along with amazing views from the balconies and a central location in one of the most affluent areas in Athens, then this is the apartment for you. Aliki’s communication throughout was excellent, a great host without any fuss."
22218431,507922436,2019-08-12,244513378,Pascal,Unfassbare Aussicht über Athen & die Akropolis. Super schöne Penthouse Wohnung mit Fahrstuhl direkt ins Appartement. 10min Fußweg und man erreicht alles was man braucht! <br/>Alles in allem ist es jeden Cent wert!
22218431,509946521,2019-08-15,131484292,Olivia,Aliki’s place was beautiful! The view was amazing! We truly felt like we were living the lavious life staying here. The place was a mini apartment with tons of space and located close enough to everything. We walked everywhere.

22218431,522402863,2019-09-02,34780621,William,"Aliki was the ideal host for our visit to Athens. She went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable not only when visiting, but before we arrive as well. Her condo is quite honestly, as good as it gets - beautiful, comfortable and simply the best views. You will not regret your decision to stay!"
22218431,523655155,2019-09-04,1934548,Matt,"Aliki’s place was amazing! Super clean and modern space stocked with all the amenities.

The location is superb with amazing views of Athens and the Acropolis, and very close to everywhere we wanted yto go. Hope to come back very soon!"
22218431,524542762,2019-09-06,8816211,Derek,"Lovely and spacious apartment, in a nice residential area not too far from all the big sites. The outdoor patios were great for relaxing!"
22218431,525631855,2019-09-08,23850498,Victor,"Location is PERFECT in a cool neighborhood (Kolonaki) with lots of fun restaurants and bars (Jazz in Jazz is literally steps away with a huge whiskey and, of course, jazz selection) but quiet and a little away from the crowds and craziness that is Plaka. But, since you have to go there, and the Acropolis, at least once, the good news is it's only a short walk (20 min) away! Two floors of the penthouse with 1.5 baths, 2 stunning balconies overlooking Athens, the Acropolis, and the Olympic stadium, dishwasher and washing machine, and a fridge stocked with fruit, eggs, and milk (as well as coffee, bread, and cereal in the pantry). Akili and Yianni were wonderful hosts who made check in easy and made us feel at home. Absolutely would stay here again, almost felt like we didn't want to go out anywhere because it was so nice here!"
22218431,527921950,2019-09-12,267230946,Steve,"Outstanding view and beautiful home, Aliki stocked the fridge and cupboard which was a pleasant surprise.  Really easy to get to many great restaurants and sites from this location. Very safe neighborhood but hang on to your valuables when you ride the metro, we encountered pick pockets and you never see them coming."
22218431,529088374,2019-09-14,177237876,Jeff,Most gracious host. Beautiful place. Quiet neighborhood. Would love to come back and spend more time.

Close to major attractions as well as groceries and restaurants.  It is a great spot, but be aware that it is on the side of a mountain and stairs are involved.  We highly recommend this special place."

She had answered all of our questions promptly.<br/>Our family visited Athens in October 2019, checking in was easy, Aliki provided us with all necessary information way ahead of time.<br/>When we arrived Aliki’s apartment was immaculate, beautifully decorated and looked exactly the same as on photos. We enjoyed stunning views of Acropolis and the city from the large balconies.<br/>At the time of our arrival we were greeted by Christina. She was very kind and she made sure she had answered all of our questions. It was very nice to find fresh fruit, cold water, eggs, bread and butter in the refrigerator. Traveling with 2 children we found it very helpful. <br/>The location of the apartment is very convenient. Close to all of the main attractions. Our family walked everywhere. The area of Kolonaki is famous for upscaled shopping, great food, quiet and safe neighborhood. We slept with balcony doors open it was silent at night.<br/>Aliki and Christina were very helpful with recommendations to local restaurants and things to do in Athens. We wanted to go to visit one of the islands around Athens and Aliki provided information which island best to visit and best ways to get there. We truly enjoyed the hospitality and highly recommend Aliki’s apartment. We already miss it and we hope to come back to her place again."

Enjoy!"

They provided breakfast for us which was helpful especially with our daughter. The bedroom is on the second floor of the apartment which is really nice because it’s extra quiet.

My husband and I stayed here for our first time in Athens and it EXCEEDED all of our expectations. When we arrived she had eggs, milk, honey, loaf of bread, coffee, tea, fresh fruit all waiting for us... and that was just the start. She also answered all the questions I had about getting from the airport and she even coordinated a airport transfer very early with George and he was great! We LOVED Athens and will definitely be back mostly in part to how welcome we felt in Alikis place."

22218431,644122654,2020-07-30,46058040,Mary-Louise,The location is fantastic but the apartment needs a lot of maintenance. The host was never available by phone and the air conditioning and wifi did not work properly. It’s all about the location and the view.

22218431,416351291944091651,2021-07-28,17272414,Angela,"We had a wonderful stay at Aliki’s beautiful penthouse! The apartment is in a great location in Kolonaki. Yes, you have to do some uphill walking, but it is well worth the effort when you reach the apartment with it’s amazing view over Athens and the Parthenon from both of the large, and well equipped balconies.  If walking uphill is difficult for you, you can always easily reach Aliki’s place by taxi. Check in was easy and friendly, and any questions were promptly answered. Aliki even arranged for a taxi to take us to the airport. The apartment has everything you could need for a comfortable stay.  It even has a lift that leads directly into the apartment. We would love to stay here again on our next trip to Athens! Thank you for a wonderful visit!"

An incredible location- you can walk 20 minutes and be at the sites of the Acropolis, and a pleasant surprise was the street it is on is an alley of restaurants/bars/cafes so you’d two outside into a vibrant nightlife. But inside it was so quiet. It was like being in a small oasis right in the center of the city. <br/>The place is just as pictured, very nice and clean, easy self-check in and check out. We loved it and would definitely come back! An excellent choice."

There is a small lift which helped with our bags. <br/>The rooms were well equipped with very comfy beds. Each room has balcony access and romantic views over quaint houses and hilltop.<br/><br/>The kitchenette was utilitarian and I really appreciated the modern design of the apartment  For example, the cooking area positioned outside the apartment, this meant that the smells were not around after cooking.  <br/><br/>Very convenient to shops, taxis a few streets away and local food and bars. The restaurants were atmospheric with reasonably priced food. <br/><br/>We could not have wished for better accommodation in Athens and highly recommend Aliki’s  place to all travellers who are looking for a view, atmosphere, friendliness and convenience.<br/>Thank you for looking after us so well!"

Aliki was thoughful enough to provide a stocked kitchen with various amenities. Located in Kolonaki, there are several very nice restaurants just a short walk away. I highly recommend the Stinking Bishop if you're looking for good food and spirits. Taxi from the airport will cost 40 Euro but once you get to the apartment, you are in prime location. In terms of value, I don't think you will find a better stay in the area."

The space doesn’t have a clothes washer, however, the host was kind in telling us about a place called White Lavender about 5 minute walk around the corner that launders your clothes for €10 for a 4kg bag. There are also some amazing bars and restaurants not even 5 minutes walk away. Syntagma Square is a 15 minute walk mostly all down hill. Strongly recommend if you’re looking for a central location with a great host!"
22247143,543668671,2019-10-08,19453321,Mark,"Stop. Don't look any further. This is the place you want to stay. Nice modern appartement, in a quiet neighbourhood with tons of nice cafes and restaurants around the corner and in walking distance to the centre/acropolis area. On top of you have Aliki and her family as hosts. Rub your hands you found this gem!"

La terrazza è bellissima, perfetta per rilassarsi con un bicchiere di vino dopo una giornata passata nel traffico e nel rumore. Tutto è molto curato, pulito e di buon gusto. Il letto è molto comodo e la dotazione per la prima colazione è generosa. Aliki è una padrona di casa sempre disponibile e attenta. Check in e out molto facile. Decisamente da raccomandare."

The groups overall experience was great! The rooms were just like in the pictures. The location is very central and you can reach a lot of places by foot. Communication and bookings were very uncomplicated and thanks to Carolinas great care and hospitality our stay was very pleasant. Would definitely recommend to stay here while in Athens.

22253539,575020801,2019-12-09,21798067,Jim,"I stayed in the Artemis apartment and I found it be outstanding. The space was ample (I was alone) and the furniture contemporary. <br/>The area surrounding is urban and yet there are some chic eateries to be found within a short walk (300m). <br/>The city centre is a 1km walk from the appt and easy to access on foot, or via the nearby train station.<br/>The gym is ample and well equipped. The ceiling low if you’re someobe who likes to lift heavy and high and skip rope - best to do this outside in the court yard. (Note: Some staff use this courtyard for a smoking area and I avoided this during these times.)<br/>The amenities are helpful. Washing machine and dryer are shared amongst all other appartments. I had no trouble with them as my visit was during a quiet December period.<br/>I’d highly recommend Artemis appt. I’d also stay here again."

It is a 2-minute walk away from the Panathenaic Stadium (a must-see sight!) and tourist bus routes. The neighbourhood is nice to walk around and we felt safe (3 girls). Despina and the rest of her team did a great job at making us feel welcome and Despina was very responsive to messages, with checking in and out made very easy.

22257280,269894514,2018-05-28,2618254,Dodo,"Unhesitatingly, this was a 5 star experience as s superhost myself, hosting 500 guests every yea and experienced other Airbnb apartments every 2-3 months.  All the ingredients, style, amenities, comfort, location, and last, but not least, our host Panos and also his fiancé — made for an excellent a week long stay . <br/><br/>First, the apartment itself. It pulls off what can be a difficult act for airbnb apartments that are actually lived in by their owners (as opposed to dedicated full time rentals). It has a lovely authentic style that clearly reflects the sensibilities of the owners— tasteful, airy, modern, with some original art work—alongside some personal touches—i.e. the collection of high-end design magazines, family photographs, etc—-yet without any personal “clutter” that can dominate when renting someone’s home. <br/><br/>For those for whom amenities are important, the apartment comes superbly equipped: a modern full kitchen with every conceivable gadget necessary to cook; a nespresso coffee machine with cartridges, detergents, washer tablets, olive oil, spices, etc, TV with Netflix is hooking you to every important network; and most wonderful of all, the marble total 3 bathrooms (1 master bathroom, 1 en suite bathroom,  1 en suite shower and more toilet). The central A/C is really strong, cooling each and every room at the demanded level . I tested the wifi and it was around 24Mbits. Whatever they put in the apartment details has probably no weak ROI , however makes your stay more delightful that you want to spend your time not exploring the city but staying, enjoying the comfort as your own place.<br/><br/>The location is of course key. Perfectly located on a charming, street in a bustling, trendy neighborhood Kolonaki, literally 2 mins to the center with great neighborhood cafes and restaurant bars.  Other historical spots including Acropolis, are all at the walking distance from 5 to 30 mins max. We especially appreciated our hosts, who invited us for a dinner, making you feel more local but made theirselves available during our stay in a way that truly ‘went beyond the call of duty”. During the dinner long chat, I asked these couple, both architects many questions and getting many friendly answers about the challenge during the renovation.   <br/><br/>Prior to arriving, the communication was perfect and the agreed the arrival time properly. At the meeting time, everything was precise and smooth. They helped with the luggages until the check-in time.  We found a hand made prepared magazine about things to do in the neighborhood and other parts. The recommendations for restaurants and bars were not just generic but personal suggestions from an Athenians experience who clearly is in the know on the social scene. <br/><br/>100% recommended with each and every details, that adds a value for the perfect experience.

22257280,271350107,2018-06-01,20277445,Danil,"I am travelling to Greece for more than 10 years. <br/>Every year i spend arround 2 month a year in different regions of Greece. <br/>So, basically, i ve been around different places. <br/><br/>Appartment by Nefeli is something speciall. <br/><br/>It is stylish and modern. With fantastic disegner taste. It is new and fresh. <br/>Total space is huge. 3 balconys. 2 large bedrooms. 2 private bathrooms. 1 bathroom for common use. Large kitchen. Fantastic living room with huge dinner table and very comfortable lounge area. <br/><br/>In appartament was everything for your comfortable stay ! Many clean towels. Kitchen was full of tea and coffe, vine and  snacks, breakfast food. Dinner plates and glasses was like in restaurant. Even slippers waiting for us. <br/><br/>All rooms are 100% bright, fresh air and super clean. Rooms are very silent. <br/>We did not want to leave this apparatment even for 5 minutes. <br/>The location arround is the most posh and superb. Full of restaurants, bars and bakery shops. <br/>Also many clothes stores. Kolonaki region is like the best place in Athens. <br/>Parking lot is 4 minutes by walk. Very safe. <br/><br/>Our check in was fast, and very helpfull. Mother Anna did fantastic job to help us arround. <br/><br/>So, as for my opinion, this is ONE of the BEST places to stay in Athens. <br/>If i will have a chance, it would be a pleasure to come back to Nefeli. <br/><br/>Thank you very much for everything. <br/>With much respect, Daniel."

22257280,289818213,2018-07-13,14396577,Nick,"Nefeli's apartment is everything it was advertised to be. We were warmly welcomed by our hosts and introduced to Athens and the neighbourhood. <br/><br/>Athens was mid 30°C whilst we were there and the apartment was comfortable when we returned each day. The A/C is also very effective when we needed the boost.<br/><br/>The appartment is about 5min walk from the greek parliament if you want to watch the changing of the guards and about 10-15min walk from the shops in the centre of town and the Acropolis precinct.  So IMHO a very good location. <br/><br/>We found the apartment to be very comfortable, very good value and be more than happy to stay again"

22257280,318093839,2018-09-03,5801267,Candace,We had an amazing time in Athens and owe much of that to Nefeli!  Her apartment was absolutely perfect.  We are all designers and loved the special architectural touches throughout the space.  Nefeli was extremely helpful and quick to respond when we had questions.  We hope to be back soon & will highly recommend to our friends!!
22257280,319770212,2018-09-07,8537437,Mikey,Do yourself a favor and book this house!  It is in a perfect location and very walkable to most of the attractions of Athens. The photos of the house are beautiful but in person it is even better. This is a true find!
22257280,326305242,2018-09-22,87861511,Jen And Elliot,"As other reviews mention, this is a great space and a fantastic neighborhood. Abundant food, grocery, and sightseeing options within walking distance. The apartment is very large, impeccably decorated and comfortable. Kitchen is well stocked. Yolenis just downstairs is open late with tasty food and gourmet groceries. Lycabatta Hill is just a quick uphill hike for astounding views and sunsets. Don’t hesitate to rent Nefeli’s place! The only downside is that the apartment entrance and stairwell is a little dark and smelly. Not sure why, seems out of character for the neighborhood and caliber of the apartment."
22257280,329962001,2018-09-30,52022654,Gill,"Nefeli’s apartment is just perfect. Great location. Everything and more than you need. It is well worthy of its 5 star rating. We were greeted by Nefeli’s mother in law who was very welcoming and understanding of our late ferry arrival. <br/><br/>The location of the apartment is close to quality shops, restaurants, transport links, and within 20 minutes walk of all main sites and museums. <br/><br/>Thank you Nefeli and team for a great stay. We will definitely book again when we revisit Athens."

A great location right beside Yoleni’s — a fabulous eatery, and close enough to get to the attractions we wanted to see on foot. Thank you so much for our memorable stay in Athens. We recommend this place to everyone."

We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Nefeli's apartment and had the pleasure of experiencing some of the cafes / restaurants as well as all the great shopping in the area.   We were made to feel right at home from the minute we were greeted.  Nefeli's guide to Athens is certainly comprehensive and very useful for anyone travelling as a couple or with their family.  Thanks for having us Nefeli.  We hope to come again soon.

L'appartement est situé sur le toit d'un immeuble de 6 étages, ce qu'il le rend charmant et atypique et nous permet d'avoir une vue incroyable sur athenes (notamment de l'Acropole). La climatisation est un vrai plus ainsi que la terrasse sur laquelle on peut manger. Il y'a aussi la wifi.

Er hat uns alles gezeigt  und erklärt. <br/>Die Unterkunft befindet sich in einer sehr bewohnten  Gegend,  parken ist hier schwer!  Allerdings  ist von der Unterkunft  aus,  alles schnell zu erreichen. Der Weg ins Zentrum ist super  einfach.  <br/>Die Unterkunft  befindet  sich in einem Mehrfamilienhaus,  ganz oben auf dem Dach.  Man hat einen separaten Eingang. Von dieser Etage hat man einen atemberaubenden Blick. Die Terrasse ist sehr gemütlich  eingerichtet und lädt zum entspannen ein.  Wir konnten von da aus sogar  den Sonnenuntergang beobachten.  Die Unterkunft  selbst ist zwar klein,  aber nett eingerichtet. Man findet alles,  was man braucht. Panos hat sich um ehtweiige Utensilien  gekümmert. Die<br/>Unterkunft ist auch sehr sauber.  Der einzige Minuspunkt ist die Dusche.  Diese hat auf dem Boden Flecken und ist im allgemeinem<br/>sehr verkalkt. Der Duschkopf hat nicht grade zum duschen  eingeladen.  Außerdem  könnte  der Badezimmermülleimer ausgetauscht werden.

The place is tidy and modern and has a fantastic deck with view of the Acropolis.  It's quiet and very private and I felt it was an excellent value.  Everything is new and modern and it's in a great location.  He made some good local recommendations for me and even offered to refund a couple nights when I unexpectedly had to go out of town sooner than anticipated.  He's a super cool guy and the place has great energy.  I would highly recommend and I hope you enjoy your stay in Athens as much as I did.
22266820,405087255,2019-01-26,220837838,JungYeop,"Kind host, perfect house"

He gave me tips on where to go, and he responded right away when I messaged him. I highly recommend his place for future stays, not to mention, the balcony/veranda was super awesome and posh! Morning coffees and smoke breaks out there very relaxing:)"

Si trova a 20, 25 minuti a piedi  dalla principale piazza di Atene. Ci sono vari market vicini e locali per mangiare. Panos è una persona educata ,premurosa e pratica. Nel suo appartamento non manca assolutamente nulla per un buon soggiorno.Unica cosa il bagno risulta essere un pò rumoroso di notte.  Se dovessi tornare ad Atene ci tornerei senza dubbio. Ancora grazie Panos."

Unfortunately, Panos was not available for a personal acquaintance but his sister met us in a day of arrival and show us everything we need. Despite the fact that Panos was away, he was always ready to answer all our questions via (Hidden by Airbnb) and gave us all the necessary recommendations. <br/><br/>Please, don't have any doubts about booking this apartment: the room is cozy, clean, has a beautiful view from the balcony, located in a pretty good location, and equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable living."

It is a short walk from the metro and the tramway, which allowed me to go easily southward as well as to the main touristic attractions.   The neighbourhood may look rough at first glance but I actually felt safe in the evening. Finally, Panos was a friendly and dedicated host."

22266820,541367793,2019-10-05,109805014,Elisabetta,"The flat is in a very central area, but at the same time is very quiet. It's easy to reach it and not far from two metro stations. 15 minutes walk from Acropoli, that you can see very clearly from the terrace. The flat is very comfy and well organized. There's everything you might need. Panos is very kind and patient and the communication was very easy! Highly recommended!"
22266820,544054382,2019-10-09,116928929,Laura,Panos's place was a nice studio with a view of the Parthenon. It was easy to walk places from there and to catch public transport as well. I'd recommend this place!

22266820,580143264,2019-12-22,213570624,Stefania,Το σπίτι είναι σε πάρα πολύ βολική τοποθεσία κι ο Πάνος πολύ εξυπηρετικός. Το σπίτι δε μου έδωσε την αίσθηση πως λάμπει από καθαριότητα αλλά ήταν εντάξει. Το μόνο αρνητικό ήταν πως επειδή είναι ένα δωματιάκι στην ταράτσα της πολυκατοικίας με φοβιζε η μετάβαση από το κτήριο της πολυκατοικίας στο σπίτι γιατί στην ταράτσα δεν έχει φως και φοβόμουν μη βρω κανέναν στην ταράτσα πριν μπω στο σπίτι. Αλλά κάτι τέτοιο δε συνέβη και η διαμονή μου ήταν μια χαρά. Το μπαλκονάκι είναι υπέροχο και η θέα επίσης. Θεωρώ πως η αντιστοιχία τιμής και παροχών είναι ακριβεστατη γι αυτό δε μπορώ να έχω και κανένα παράπονο. Έμεινα ικανοποιημένη.
22266820,581978855,2019-12-26,306020074,Pin-Lun,Really great place for passengers.<br/>Comfortable and Cozy! <br/>Feel like at home

22266820,590331847,2020-01-08,299438109,Anna,"A very nice, cozy studio. Your place on the rooftop, with a large terrace with beautiful views. Safe neighbourhood - asked a few Athenians! I was visiting the place in winter and it was OK in terms of temperature, especially the water heater is very efficient. Also the comforter is very warm. I must say, though, that if you need to feel VERY warm you may not feel 100% comfortable. This is a question of personal preferences and it does not influence my general very good assessment of the place. Very good location, 10 minutes from the metro station. Panos is a very reliable host, always in touch!"
22266820,592903578,2020-01-14,255640492,Csongor,"Panos is a very good host. Friendly and helpful.<br/>The apartment was nice and clean. From the terrace you can see the Acropolis and many more things. It is in the heart of the city, but very quiet. The nearest metro station (Kosmos) is 6- 8 mins walking.<br/>I can recommend for long or for short staying also."
22266820,594260077,2020-01-18,283980894,Ashley,"Great room ever!!! Clean and cozy room. Warm with heater and no problem using the hot water. Last but not the least, It has a beauitufl terras! Definitely recommended.<br/><br/>*However if you are not able to use the internet it would be hard to check in since you have to meet the host. Therefore make sure you buy your sim card in advance"
22266820,618307610,2020-03-15,127317767,Akis,I stayed in Panos apartment for 2 months and I am very satisfied with the services offered and communication with Panos. It is a small and cozy apartment perfect for 1 or 2 people stay and fully-equipped for a longer stay. The view is excellent and the location of the place is very comfortable. I truly recommend it!
22266820,634735051,2020-07-05,221185043,Magda,"Ο Πάνος ήταν υπέροχος οικοδεσπότης. Η επικοινωνία μαζί του ήταν άριστη. Το διαμέρισμα βρίσκεται σε πολλή καλή τοποθεσία. Κοντά στο μετρό αλλά και σε φούρνο, supermarket, εστιατόρια. Πραγματικά απόλαυσα τη διαμονή μου. Σίγουρα θα έμενα ξανά."
22266820,636332975,2020-07-10,95562818,Georgia,"The roof-flat of Panos is located extremely conveniently 4-5 minutes away from two Metro Stations and two Tram stations, making it super easy to reach Syntagma Square in 5 or the beach in less than 20 min. The neighborhood itself is perhaps not the most aesthetically pleasing, which is often the case in downtown Athens, but it is absolutely safe, quiet and feels very home-ish. The locals are super friendly and you can find everything you need, food, drinks, coffee, pharmacies, only a couple dozen meters away. On Mondays there is an open producer market around the corner, where you can get the best veggies and fruit you can imagine! <br/>The flat is simple, yet thoughtfully equipped, it has all you need for a convenient stay. Coming from a super tiring and stressful trip, I enjoyed the comfortable mattress and the quiet. I slept like a log!<br/>The balcony is cute and blessed with a permanent sweet breeze, so that even in the hot summers, the evenings and nights out there are very pleasant.<br/>Most of all though it was Panos himself, who is worth having as a host! He is friendly, accommodating and communicative and has a calming quality as a person.  I hope I will see him again, perhaps at some live of his band!  Thank you Panos, for making my first week in Athens so easy!"
22266820,648587156,2020-08-09,340161348,Eleni,"My stay at Pano's place was amazing. The apartment was very cosy and the view from the balcony was lovely (you can see Saint-George church on your left, Filopappou Hill and Acropolis on your right). Perfect for someone who wants to be within walking distance from the city centre. Plus, the neighbourhood is very quiet and quaint, ideal for those who want to explore the Athenian urban scenery. Panos was an outstanding host and made my stay very pleasant and comfortable. I highly recommend it!"

La vista è magnifica, dalla terrazza con divanetto, tavolo e sedie è possibile vedere il tramonto. Nell'appartamento c'è tutto quello che serve per il soggiorno e Paros èstato rapidissimo nelle risposte alle mie domande e ci teneva che tutto andasse per il meglio."
22266820,662504372,2020-09-10,49854661,Aileen,"Very nice place to stay, on top of the roof  with elevator and a very nice view from the big balcony! Panos was very patient and fast at communication, if I needed something he didn't hestitate to bring it to the apartment. Altough it had everything I needed and I could cooke some nice stuff from the market, which is also nearby in the streets once a week :) <br/>In walking distance to all kind of stores, supermarkets, Acropolis or Tram/Metro Stations! Also fast and reliable W-Lan ;) <br/>Definitly recommended."

It has everything you need to stay for a short or longer period. Everything is super clean and tidy. It has an amazing view over the city and there is so much privacy on top of the roof. Beside the accomodation, Panos is absolutely a very nice host: he replies very quick on every question. He was there to welcome me and I could reach out to him whenever needed."

The balcony is honestly amazing, and this is definitely one of the best value-for-money Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at. Panos was a great host as well, providing me all the info and amenities I needed"
22266820,423638200338571891,2021-08-07,21017642,Alessandro,Top of the top. Best option if you are staying in Athens!

Good communication with host, even he was for a couple of days not in Athen. Because of my flight time it was possible to stay a few hours longer then the regular Check-Out time. Nice big Terrace, view on the area and houses around, enjoyed my morning coffees on the terrace."
22266820,434541982783765876,2021-08-22,249345079,Joanisova,"Panos studio is cosy, nice and clean. I really loved the terrace! It takes only 20 minutes to go to the center, you don't need to use the transport and in the same time, the place is not noisy at all! <br/><br/>I felt like at home :) <br/><br/>There is also a small supermarket very near to the house and bakery (5minutes). I used to go to Neos Kosmos station when I wanted to take metro or tram.<br/><br/>For sea lovers, I recommend to go to the nice beach closed to Athens - Kavouri beach (first you take the metro, red line to Elliniko,then the bus no 122, station Ουρανου ) - but be careful, the bus don't stop on every bus station, give the signal to the driver when you want to get off the bus!"
22266820,441013666931461227,2021-08-31,110174843,Anna,"The apartment is lovely! It might at first seem a bit strange because it is literally on the roof but it is really great - gives you this “Karlsson on the roof” vibe :). The balcony is fantastic, and as the neighborhood is super quiet, I was even able to work there enjoying fresh air and the view at the same time. The apartment is exactly what it is in the pictures; small but more than enough for one person; has everything you might need. Communication with the host was smooth, and he was always quick to answer any questions and resolve any issues."
22266820,452656554938973814,2021-09-16,203379296,Simon,"Fantastic apartment in Athens. There is a huge balcony with an amazing view of the Acropolis and Filopappou Hill - you even just about see the sea!<br/>Most of Athens is within 45 minutes walk from the apartment, and good transport links nearby.<br/>All the amenities you’d need - a fridge/freezer, basic hob/oven, AC, kettle, and moka pot.<br/>The balcony is shielded, and the apartment is like a separate penthouse at the top so feels nice and private. Location is pleasant, safe and quiet, there’s even a 24/7 “AB” metro shop 2 minutes walk away.<br/>Panos is a fantastic and welcoming host too. <br/>The one minor downside is being a studio flat, the fridge can make a small amount of noise if you require complete silence at night. <br/>Even so, this is the place to stay if you’re Athens. 100% would recommend."
22266820,458389993795397578,2021-09-24,201507070,János,"Panos is a great host, he was very helpful during the whole 5 days we spent in Athens. The apartment is suitable for 2 person and it is located near to metro stations (6-8 minte walks.) The balcony is also a great addition if you want to watch the sunrise/sunset over the city."
22266820,469966314463447535,2021-10-10,177652424,Nolan,"Panos place is everything expected from the listing. Nice, clean, and very accessible to major sight seeing attractions by foot if you want to walk. Overall a good experience."
22266820,475109068075480103,2021-10-17,176055271,Ilya,"Спасибо большое хозяину за гостеприимство, помогал и подсказывал быстро и по любому вопросу. Апартаменты отличные, есть все необходимое. Очень близко к центру, также удобно добираться к морю"
22266820,479403855469162654,2021-10-23,106818047,Paul,"a lovely quiet stay in Athens. Neos Kosmo is definitely the nearest metro and it connects with trams to the coast or 3/ 4 stops into the city. Plenty of shops, cafes, bakeries and restaurants around the area if you don't want to go to the city but that said the city is very close by metro which is exceptionally cheap for a European capital. I highly recommend booking this place."
22275934,222927397,2017-12-31,82067905,Anais,Great place to stay! Very central in a nice quiet area with a very warm welcome from the owner! I recommend it with closed eyes.
22275934,236432035,2018-02-19,26714545,Zaki,"This is my first time in Athens and i fell in love because of the lovely place, the nice neighborhood and the very helpful host. <br/>It is walking distance to the center and metro. Also there are a lot of cosy local restaurants and cafes near the apartment. <br/>Highly recommend!!"
22275934,238630339,2018-02-26,102388983,Efi,"The place was amazing. The room (including bed) was very big as well as the bathroom. The veranda had a very nice view. The place was overall very secured (locks to walk in, in elevator, before entering the room). The breakfast was lovely (just what someone needs). The amenities where amazing. The place was central, 5m walking distance from Kolonaki square and from Evangelismos metro station.<br/>It is highly recommended!"

22275934,246750249,2018-03-26,50305577,Iannis,"Happy to have stayed in this spacious and modern appartment. The huge bed is really comfortable, nice to have a big bathroom, wide balcony with a great view on Athens. Special thanks for all the fruit and beverages. <br/>Aliki and her daughter were very friendly and helpful. There is a 4 person appartment upstairs, and another big one next door, so it's very convenient for those travelling with friends or big family."
22275934,248309949,2018-03-31,45348207,Fengtao,"Aliki's daughter and the cleaning lady were both very friendly, although Christina(Aliki's daughter) couldn't be able to come for check-in, she gave me a warmly welcome by phone. The apartment was clean, I can bare foot step on the ground. Scenery at the balcony is exactly as the picture showed and amazing. I can recommend this apartment without restriction!"
22275934,249937143,2018-04-03,107516167,Eleni,Great Location! Amazing minimal design and breathtaking view! Nice breakfast! Fast communication! Fully equipped appartment! Aliki‘s daughter is very friendly and helpful and wants everything to be perfect! Would love to stay there again! Definitely recommended!
22275934,257693458,2018-04-27,8301588,Anelie,"Aliki's AirBnB is based in a very calm and peaceful area. The appartment itself  is on the 5th floor, so you have a great view over the city (unfortunately not the acropolis). Approximately 10 mins to Evangelismos metro station and, strolling through the nice neighborhood of Kolonaki, 20mins to Syntagma Square. The appartment itself was clean and modern, Aliki's daughter welcomed me very heartly and made sure that I got everything I needed. There are enough pillows and a cozy blanket on a very comfortable (middle/hard matress) bed. The bathroom is a little bit in need of a refurbishment, but despite that it was a pleasant stay."
22275934,259498667,2018-05-01,106096869,Salvatore,Sicuramente la collocazione che consente dal terrazzo <br/>una vista panoramica sulla città imperdibile. L'appartamento è di recente ristrutturazione e ha tutti i conforta per rendere piacevole il soggiorno ad Atene.
22275934,261790509,2018-05-07,23110099,Julia,"Our stay in Athens was perfect! The apartment was clean and had a wonderful balcony with a great view over Athens. We very much enjoyed Kolonaki with its green streets, nice coffee shops and restaurants. <br/><br/>Thanks, Aliki and your daughter for the perfect stay!<br/>Julia"
22275934,264870009,2018-05-15,6523404,Carsten,"Alikis place is situated a little bit above Athens in Kolonaki, the apartment has a nice view over the town. You can explore the city by foot from her place. Its nice to be a little bit separated from the lively districts in the evening after your visits to the Akropolis, the old town and the museums. The room is spacious, so is the bathroom. Especially nice is that you have a coffee machine and a fridge in the room, and it is already equipped with coffee, milk, tea, fruits, eggs, bread when you arrive so you can have your own breakfast on the terrace with a view on your first morning in the sunshine. Aliki always responded immediately when I had a question and was exceptional helpfull. Thank you Aliki for the nice stay in Athens!"
22275934,267027514,2018-05-21,21897462,Christian,"Aliki's flat beat my expectations. Perfectly located in Kolonaki, you're a stone throw away from great eateries and a neighborhood market on Fridays. The place is clean, spacious, and convenient. Aliki offers a fridge full of breakfast goodness and refreshments. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by Catherine, who is so generous, hospitable and a member of the staff. We had some challenges with the elevator upon our arrival with a 3 month old baby. Catherine helped us with our luggage up 5 flights of stairs and then some. This elevator was quickly resolved. Not only did Catherine go above and beyond, but she also stayed until we were comfortably settled. The location is ideal if you're looking to be away from tourists and are looking for a strong neighborhood feel. Bathroom is clean and welcoming. The room was dusty and could have been cleaned prior to arrival. Outside of this, I would recommend Aliki's flat to anyone wanting a getaway to Athens. The balcony is spacious and welcoming. While we loved being there and found the flat well located, it is a steep climb to the apartment since you are at the heels of mount Lycabettus in Athens. We loved that, but it can be a challenge for others. Thank you Aliki for your hospitality and we look forward to visiting again! - Christian"
22275934,268828011,2018-05-26,182350786,Alex,Great apartment for vacation. Very nice hosts!

22275934,297082470,2018-07-27,78055167,Kelvin,"You couldn't ask for a better place to stay at in Athens. It is located in the best neighborhood in Athens. Kolonaki offers a lot of excellent restaurants and shops. They are definitely more expensive, but well worth the money. From the apartment it isn't too far to the top of Lykabettos.<br/><br/>The apartment was lovely. It was clean, had great AC (very important in July) and a big balcony to enjoy the sun and quietness. The amenities for breakfast were great as well. You're provided with toast, jam, butter, eggs, fruits and even muesli. There are supermarkets near the apartment. If you need lactose free or almond milk look for the Delicatessen stores. There are plenty of them in the neighborhood. <br/><br/>All in all we really enjoyed our stay. Communication was perfect. We will recommend this apartment to all friends that are planning on staying in Athens."

We found goodies for breakfast in the fridge and we could eat on the terrace while watching the city. The apt has wonderfoul views on the city, it is very close to all touristic objectives and very cozy. <br/>It has eveything you wish for!"

Everything was fantastic - we will come back."

The apartment is located on the hill side, in a quite neighborhood. Restaurants and bars are just 5 minutes away. It’s nice for her to include the breakfast: cereals, bread, jam, honey and some fruit. Would have been excellent to have a bit more selection. We enjoyed our stay, Thanks for having us!"

The room is very spacious with more than enough storage and closet space. The flat is very well located in Kolonaki, and it is true that it is up a nice hill, but I enjoy a nice walk! It is very accurate how amazingly quite this space and area are! I couldn’t hear anyone else around me in my flat and this came in very handy with the jet lag! Christina (Aliki’s daughter) and the family are very helpful and go out of their way to make you feel at home and comfortable! I wouldn’t hesitate booking with them!"
22275934,343057485,2018-10-30,159206977,Ellen,"Going to miss the great view of this lovely little place! Don’t hesitate to ask Christina and the family about recommendations for eateries and cafes! There is plenty nearby in Kolonaki to keep you full and satisfied during your stay in Athens! I highly recommend staying here for a quiet, beautiful, and unique get away in Athens!"
22275934,349390059,2018-11-17,156219563,Pascal,We had a lovely time staying in this apartment in the heart of Athens. All attractions were reachable by foot or a short metro trip. Also located in a district with a wide variety of different bars and restaurants.<br/>The apartment was beautiful with its balcony over-looking the city. Would recommend this to anyone else traveling to Athens :)

Für 2 Personen die ein paar schöne Tage in Athen verbringen wollen genau das richtige. Der Ausblick auf dem Balkon ist wunderschön und die Ausstattung wirklich top! Haben uns total wohl gefühlt.
22275934,472264212,2019-06-19,627278,Ping,Apartment is at the best neighborhood in Athens. The interior  is modern and very clean with nice view. Neighborhood has lots greens and trendy boutiques. It’s a great place to hide away from the summer heat and tourist crowd but still walking distance to all the attractions. Only thing is that you might have to share kitchen with another tenant. But there wasn’t any tenant next door during my stay so it wasn’t a problem. It’s a great place and I highly recommend.
22275934,477383595,2019-06-28,9478324,Joël,"Great place, huge balcony. I would book this place again. "
22275934,482972449,2019-07-07,15824000,Victoria,"I would recommend this place to stay if you are visiting Athens. It's not centrally located but I enjoyed being only a few minutes outside of the centre. The space is large with a comfortable bed and brilliant air conditioning. There are some breakfast things made available and a shared kitchenette area (though the food in Athens is so good you don't cook!) The cleaner who greeted me, Catherine, was really lovely too. As a lone female traveller, I felt very safe and secure. Happy to recommend."
22275934,485136949,2019-07-10,269598201,Andrei,"I enjoyed my stay at Aliki's place more than i expected. The apartment is in the middle of old city center , exactly were you would want to be on a vacation in Athens. Very beautiful and very clean , with a nice view on the city. The only downpoint was the parking space. The streets are very narrow so i had to leave my car in another neibournhood. Anyhow , when traveling to Athens the least thing you need to enjoy the city is your car."
22275934,499344733,2019-07-31,251018469,Chris,Everything was amazing.

The apartment is very nice with new furniture and well equipped. The great balcony we especially used for having breakfast. Whenever we had a question, Aliki answered immediately. I can highly recommend Aliki‘ s apartment and will definitely stay there again on my next visit in Athens."
22275934,529644259,2019-09-15,248877148,Miriam,"Beautiful suite with great view onto Athens roofs and a bit of sea! Very friendly host, super-quick replies to inquiries and perfect check-in. Will come again!"
22275934,533212159,2019-09-21,285758394,Clarissa,Alikis apartments are located at the most wonderful central quarters of the city. It takes some stairs to get up there although you can avoid the stairs by going zig-zags a little uphill. It is definitely worth it! All apartments have a view across the city and a gorgeous balcony where you can chill in the sun or have breakfast. The apartments are clean and there is everything you need. The best thing is it’s location though! Just another 10 minutes walk uphill and you have the most beautiful view across Athens you can imagine! The metro (Evangelismos) is a roughly 10 minutes walk downhill. Also you can reach the city center by food (downhill) within a 25-30 minutes walk. It’s been a gorgeous stay and we plan to come back soon! We recommend it!!
22275934,534801274,2019-09-23,112941016,Petros,"everything was absolutely great. location, host, service, price. Will definitely come back"

22275934,552284131,2019-10-21,10193740,Constantino,A great value for money! We came in on. a Friday and there was a fresh market right down below on the parallel street to ours. It was a very nice walk. Very green area and literally two steps away from the Main Street in kolonaki which is full of cafes and bars and restaurants. If you walk right as soon as you get out you are within 50 meters at the famed Dexameni square once more filled with cafes and bars and an open air cinema. It’s just a beauty area.
22275934,557119978,2019-10-31,248877148,Miriam,"This is a very very nice suite, with a stylish modern blue and white decor, very good and thought-through amenities (fridge, coffee maker, toaster, plates, balcony furniture,  etc) and a super nice and friendly host, who replies to every request within minutes! Check-in was perfect, communication very good and as a friendly (but also very useful) touch the host provide fresh fruit, milk, coffee and other breakfast items upon arrival. The view from the balcony is as far as the sea! Highly recommended!"

The residence is really nice and the view is honestly amazing. It's super close to the heart of Athens and you can visit hot places by foot easily. I would definitely book the residence again.
22275934,403365384121352184,2021-07-10,18177332,Katarzyna,"Very nice, spacious, clean place in a gorgeous location. You'll be halfway up the hill with the best view in Athens (perfect for sunrise). Shower always has hot water and good pressure which can't be taken for granted in Greece. Just bear in mind that it is seriously uphill in case you travel with elderly or disabled persons. All in all I can really recommend this place"
22275934,414234182515341709,2021-07-25,68318125,Alexander,"The place was nice, roomy shower, cold A/C, quiet neighbors, great view.  The host did a great job of showing us the place, talking to us, informing us of good cultural norms and even walking us down the street to show us some good local places to eat. The only issue we ran into was the 'free' street parking. Pay close attention to the Athens parking rules otherwise you will get a ticket like we did."

22275934,440288418694921776,2021-08-30,14654833,Alexandra,"Aliki is the great host! The communication was fast and easy. In the apartment we had everything we needed! The location of the apartment is perfect - not too far from the center, you can get everywhere by foot. There are also some restaurants nearby, but in the same time apartment is in the quiet place, so, you can relax in the evening. I would definitely recommend staying at this place!"

Also Kolonaki is such a gorgeous neighbourhood. My work is online so I was pleased to have an excellent WiFi connection, and a peacefully quiet environment. Would definitely stay here next time!"

They were present, kind, flexible, communicative and solutions-oriented throughout my entire stay. I didn’t need to worry about anything. They took care of any request/issue immediately and made sure I was happy and comfortable. Speedy, clear communication made every step easy and stress-free. Flexible on check-in time was much appreciated since my flight arrived so early.  Large, clean and lovely room with a terrific terrace outside.  Large bathroom, plenty of closet space, thoughtful snacks and water provided in the room.  Quiet building/street and comfortable bed made it easy to sleep. Lovely residential street and a short walk away from everything you need in Kolonaki - markets, shops, cafes and restaurants. I’ll definitely be back!"

22275934,462013089231630250,2021-09-29,6937175,Kim,"We really liked staying at Aliki's place! <br/><br/>The room met all our needs: very clean, spacious, good bathroom and kitchen and a large balcony with a great view ofthe city. Also, I totally agree with other positive comments about the hosts. Aliki responded very quickly and friendly and Yianni gave us a warm welcome when we arrived. <br/>We also loved staying in Kolonaki. It's a beatiful neighbourhood, which felt very safe and had lots of nice bars and restaurants. It's also very close to everything you want to visit in Athens.<br/><br/>There is just one thing to bear in mind: the apartment is halfway up Lycabettus hill. For us this wasn't a problem, but I could imagine it would be hard for older or disabled persons to make the climb every day. But on the other hand, you could take a taxi (which is very cheap)."

22275934,476594545578364065,2021-10-19,89021567,Chris,"Aliki and her daughter Christina were extremely helpful and very patient with all our questions, and need for advice. The room was nice size and came with fruit, coffee, tea, milk, muesli, bread and eggs. What a treat! They were always very willing to help us when a need arose; for instance they helped us find out how to get a train to Corinth and where we could find a lab/hospital where we could take a rapid antigen test before leaving the country. The first evening we where there, there was a an issue with the hot water and despite the hour and our insistence to fix it the next day since it was late, someone came over and resolved the issue within an hour. All to say that you will not be disappointed if you stay with Aliki at her Airbnb."
22300328,228636668,2018-01-20,75597238,Arenca,"Je déconseille cet appartement. Déjà, l'annonce n'est pas exacte. Ce n'est pas un appart entier mais deux studios dans un appartement. Et oui je pensais comme vous, pas de problème vu que chaque studio a sa porte, sa salle de bain etc., son indépendance en quelques mots. Mais quand la porte n'est ferme pas cest une autre histoire. J'ai eu ce problème-là, et vu que la personne à cote pouvait rentrer dans ma partie n'importe quelque moment et vu que le quartier où s'est trouve l'appart est très mauvais ça me faisait peur de rester dans le local avec une porte que ne ferme pas. J'ai contacté l'hôte qu'a pu régler le problème 4h après mon arrivée, c'est-à-dire à 22h quand même ! Du coup, j'ai voulu annuler et être reboursée bien evidement mais le Monsieur voulait pas. Finalement Airbnb ont reussi mais remboursée une nuit ainsi que les frais de service. Résultat ? J'ai perdu 100€ pour rien !"

Квартира только после ремонта, все новое и красивое.Очень удобная кровать!До основных достопримечательностей идти минут 15 пешком.Пока гуляли по городу оставили багаж в общем холле до вечера, что было очень удобно.И вечером самостоятельно забрали его в удобное нам время."

Супермаркет и недорогие кафе за (Website hidden by Airbnb) на всех языках.

(me and my girlfriend were scared to walk on the streets in this area and we used taxi every day when we came late from the (Website hidden by Airbnb) we paid also extra money for this...) apart from this we woke every day at 7 am due to the ""lovely"" neighbour who was kind enough to shout at his phone, of course there was also the drunk neighbour from down stairs that enjoys moaning all night. there was also piss in the lobby."

There is no problem with neighbors, noise, hot water etc. Good location, close to the metro station. On the way, cafes where you can buy very good take-out coffee for 1 euro. Very close to the local Pub ""Beeraki"", where you will eat local delicacies and listen to Greek live music (especially on Tuesdays and Sundays). I would recommend. The flat is smaller than we expected, but it is not a problem. The ability to leave your luggage after check-out is very helpful! Contact with the owners - quick and direct; they offer help and advice.<br/>We recommend it to everyone!"

Оказывается, что находится квартира в самом неудачном районе Афин. Основное население и обитатели – эмигранты, наркоманы, наркоторговцы и женщины легкого поведения. Местный народ сказал днем ходить можно, а вот по темноте нежелательно. Т.к. отдыхать приехали вдвоем с подругой, ходить пешком  после заселения не рисковали, ездили на UBER.  <br/>Балкон оказался с видом на свалку мусора, обвалившуюся крышу и старенький унитаз :)"

22313159,523626083,2019-09-04,15589616,Daniel,"What you get:<br/>-A clean, small, budget hotel-sized room.<br/>-Very central location<br/>-An affordable price<br/>-Extremely loud construction site directly outside the window that starts work at 7:30 AM.<br/>-Noisy guests staying in other rooms of this converted office building, yelling in the night."
22313159,527494278,2019-09-11,14242375,Gabbi,"Very nice space and accessible to everything. Was a little inconvenient that construction was happening loudly starting at 7am, but was nice otherwise."
22313159,530693303,2019-09-16,68847577,Juan,"Apartment is really well located in Athens in Plaka. Once you come out of the subway station is just a couple of blocks away walking thru the streets of downtown Athens. Upon arrival,  my room was on the fifth floor so you might want to ask for the wifi password in advance if you don't have data so that you can text the host that will be waiting for you.  Apartment is small but every inch is well used and is comfy. I stayed for a couple of nights and it was really close to all the main attractions and the only time I took a cab to go to mount Lycabettus it costed me less than $4 euros. Bathroom is small but practical. Overall a great experience."

22313159,588110655,2020-01-04,35541466,Mary,"We stayed at Maria's flat for 7 nights during New Years'. The location is very central and the communication with Maria, in the beginning, was good, she even offered us to book a taxi from the airport.  However, when we did the check-in, at the correct time (12 pm), the accommodation was not ready and the cleaner asked us to come back after 2 hours, something we did not expect or knew in advance, we did had the option to leave our bags. The accommodation was also not very clean, there was a chunk of hair on the bedsheet. We asked the cleaner to change it, which she did straight away. Also, the A/C was full of dust and did not work properly, which was very frustrating as it was 3 degrees outside and the flat was very cold.  The shower curtain was not fitted well and the entire bathroom floor was constantly filled with water. There was also noise during the day, from the builders outside the window and from the flats on the top floor who were renovating. I would not recommend staying there for a long period, maybe for 1-2 nights."

The location was convenient as it was in the center. Easy to find and they were helpful with the check in as I arrived late. Generally the place was well equipped and clean however the big cushions on the bed need a bit more attention as we found a bug. Also I found some glass pieces on the floor ( I am assuming a glass broke) however it had a broom and I was able to swipe it. I also broke one glass by mistake but I replaced it!"

Really do not need anything else for few days stay. Perfect wi-fi!<br/><br/>I was disappointed because few things: leaving half of soap bottle, in which there is not a soap, but mixture of soap and water is a little bit disappointing.  Also, the dishes were so dirty, that I had to clean them on my own. During the pandemic, we should especially care about the cleaniliness of place and such points as above are just unacceptable.<br/><br/>What i also did not like is the fact, that in offer there is mentioned that the host will be available - it appeared that it is not true, as there is self-check in proccess. It was fine and went without any problems, but still, but i think that it is a misleading info. Also, I think that such info as using AC and water heater at the same time is forbidden, should be placed in the offer as well.<br/><br/>I would still reccommend the stay in Here, because of the perfect location"

He also shared a long list of his own favourites in Athens.<br/>The street can be a bit noisy, depending on how loud people happen to walk by.<br/><br/>A mixed feeling was left as some youngsters apparently coming home from a bar at 2am were trying codes for the door and got it open - the security bar was on so only 10cm -, tipsy and saying they are looking for their own apt in the building. However, we understand Alex changes the code after every guest and there also is another code to the main staircase, as well as keys, so I imagine this was one time mystery and will be ensured not to happen again!"

The keyless entry was easy, the art on the walls was cool, there were spare phone chargers in one of the drawers, plenty of space to hang clothes and even a nice desk with outlets nearby to do laptop work. Agis was very responsive, had tons of tips for local restaurants (we went to Αυλή/Avli and it was a great experience) and helped us use the washer (though there is no dryer, you must lay your clothes to air dry so you should plan accordingly). All the appliances were modern and everything was functional and easy to use. Thank you for a great stay!"

A Modern and stylish studio in the heart of Athens, very close to all the best bars and restaurants. A great location! The studio was clean, provided for everything and the communication was top quality with loads of tips. Highly recommended. Thanks Agis"
22320268,261302810,2018-05-06,166212812,Kelly,"Agis' apartment is a lovely studio apartment with access to great bars and restaurants. Agis does a great job of responding quickly and answering any questions you might have. He also provides an extensive list of recommended spots to check out based on your interests. The apartment can get loud at night (we stayed on a Saturday night and there must be a club nearby because people were out quite late) but otherwise the description is on point! Thanks again, Agis!"
22320268,262184546,2018-05-08,10068778,Rémi,We spent one short night at Agis's place. The appartment is extremely well decorated leaving the impression to enter an art gallery. It is super clean and cosy and the perfect place to stay in the center of Athens if you want to enjoy the craziness of this great city. The communication was really good with Agis and the bed was really comfy. We strongly recommend to stay at Agis's.
22320268,264000606,2018-05-13,12534787,Marlène,"Nous recommandons ce logement à Athènes !<br/>L’appartement est situé <br/> dans un quartier très vivant et hyper central d’Athenes. Il est très bien décoré et propre. L’entrée dans les lieux est très facile. Agis a été très réactif. <br/>Le seul point à noter est que le quartier est très animé le soir et la nuit, beaucoup de musique et de bruit jusqu’à tard dans la nuit, impossible de dormir sans boules quiès donc voyageurs au sommeil leger : s’abstenir. Ça ne nous a pas posé de problème et nous avons plutôt apprecié le quartier vivant avec ses nombreux restos et bars !"

Place is close to all the main locations so we were able to walk to everywhere. At first I was worried about the location(especially at night) but we didn't have any problems.

Easy to locate and find parking and there is an abundance of cool bars, restaurants and coffee shops in the immediate area. The apartment is clean, spacious and although we had no trouble sleeping there are some noisey bars further down the street. Plenty of communication beforehand from Agis and all our questions were answered speedily."
22320268,267026591,2018-05-21,77774133,Adrienne,"Agis' place was great! The apartment was very stylish, and both the bed and the pull out couch were comfortable.

22320268,276289767,2018-06-13,4380820,Kenneth,"Agis's place is truly in the heart of Athens. SO easy to get to from the airport, and could not be cleaner and well laid out. I had a great experience from the second I arrived. There were a number of Airbnb-ers in the building, so ran into a few other travelers which were fun. You're about a 20-minute walk to the Acropolis, and basically a 20-minute walk to anywhere you'd' want to go. Top notch AC and a big shower, it was the whole package. Can't reccomend enough! "

Agis a su répondre avec rapidité à toutes nos demandes. <br/>L’emplacement est un gros avantage : en plein centre ville et proche du métro. L’appartement est également très bien équipé (machine à laver) et sécurisé. <br/>Les seuls inconvénients sont le bruit car l’appartement est situé dans une rue animée la nuit. De plus, nous sommes tombés sur une semaine de travaux dans cette même rue. <br/>Le deuxième petit bémol est qu’il n’y a pas de volet donc dès que le soleil se lève, l’appartement est éclairé. <br/>Nous recommandons avec plaisir cet appartement.

We had an extremely early flight the morning after our stay, so we were unable to take advantage of some of the late night activities, but it looked like a lot of fun! I will say that this area of town can be quite loud. Wasn't a big deal, just something to be prepared for. <br/><br/>Checkin was convenient and you could use a keypad for entry. Agis provided this the day before. <br/><br/>Agis was very responsible and helpful throughout our short stay, providing recommendations for taxis and other local attractions. We spent several hours at Barley Cargo, one of the suggestions we found in his comprehensive list. Awesome selection of Greek craft beer there."

We had 24 hours in Athens and the Acropolis, Museum and Flea market were within 20 minutes walking distance which was great to be able to explore. We stayed on the weekend and as other reviews suggest being close to bars it was a little noisey but with ear plugs we slept fine. We loved our stay and wished we had stayed a little longer!"

Love the fact that you have a keyless system to check in , it makes everything easier . The studio was a nice stop by in Athens and a good center point to visit. <br/><br/>The studio is located in a old Building , so it can be a little noisy at night . <br/><br/>OverAll a great Place to stay ."

A little noisy in the night due to garbage pick up trucks but other wise all good. Properly ventilated and quite spacious for a studio. <br/><br/>Agis gave us all the tips to have a great time in the area.

The interior of the apartment is very nicely done as well.  It does get noisy as it’s getting later in the night but it’s a trade off to make due to the location."

He was very communicative and accommodating to our crazy flight schedules. He allowed us to leave our luggage and freshen up in another one of his apartments while ours was getting ready. Check in and out were very easy as all we needed were door codes. He provided us with plenty of great tips about the area and transportation to his place. When we had questions regarding possibly renting a car, he provided us with immediate feedback regarding nearby parking garages (we ended up not renting a car because of the difficulty... best idea). Both of his apartments were clean and had great decor. The location was fantastic!! Very close to several bars, restaurants, shopping, and easy walks to all the historic sites. Wonderful host and apartments and we highly recommend staying at one of his places!"

Agis ist ein toller Gastgeber, der immer schnell antwortet und sich um seine Gäste kümmert! <br/>Die Wohnung ist neben einer der besten Bars Athens gelegen „The Clumsies“, auf jeden Fall einen Besuch wert! Zu mal man es nur zwei Häuser weiter heim hat :)<br/>In der Nähe liegen viele Supermärkte und man kommt schnell zu allen wichtigen und tollen Plätzen. Die Bahnstation ist auch nicht weit. <br/><br/>Unser Tipp: vor der Metro Station oben steht immer ein Mann mit einem Wagen und so runden Broten etc. Die einen Kringel sehen aus wie Berliner/Krebbel ... probiert sie, sie schmecken Mega super Ober Hammer!! :D<br/>Unsere Daumen sind definitiv oben wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen!"

The apartment is very modern and nice. Athens never sleeps so we would recommend a sound machine app on your phone. Being close to everything means you're not far from the action (and some noise at night).

Everything else was perfect however and Agis was very good with recommendations!

22320268,472278317,2019-06-19,72085292,Hayley,"Great location, clean and tidy. Elevator to access on first floor was handy with bags. Apartment was very noisy the first night we stayed which was a public holiday, could not sleep at all, second night (normal weekday)  was much better. Code sent to check in making it easy to access the apartment - Agis kindly let us check in an hour early as the apartment was ready."
22320268,472721848,2019-06-20,26674049,Meghan,We stayed in two of Agis' places and both were perfect for our stay. They are clean and decorated very well. The location is perfect - we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and it's easy to walk to the subway that brings you right to the airport. Agis was very responsive before our stay and during our stay. Would definitely recommend staying here!
22320268,473788436,2019-06-22,66587118,Dan,Great place for a stay in Athens. Stylish and well located.

22320268,491331674,2019-07-20,62790843,Enrico,"Soggiorno perfetto nel cuore di Atene, facilmente raggiungibile anche con mezzi pubblici, le indicazione di Agis anche per quanto riguarda i ristoranti e come vivere al meglio la città precise e puntuali. Check in con codice veloce e facile da utilizzare. L’unica cosa che posso rilevare è l’insonorizzazione, si sentono alcuni rumori dalla strada (anche di alcuni pub e bar) ma a noi non ha dato fastidio.<br/>Abbiamo soggiornato con 2 bimbi piccoli che si sono sentiti perfettamente a loro agio."
22320268,495491929,2019-07-26,12233815,Julie,"Original et très bien situé, impeccablement équipé! Nous avons découvert Athènes à partir de cet endroit et avons été heureux de voir des facettes encore non explorées ! Journée et soirée mémorable en famille."

Agis was extremely responsive and helpful with all questions. Finding the apartment and checking in was seamless. I highly recommend this apartment for anyone staying in Athens!"
22320268,513120022,2019-08-19,130840065,Daniel,"Fantastic place for what we needed! We stayed here for one night on our honeymoon after the Greek Islands. It was in a perfect location with walking distance to most of the tourist attractions and restaurants/bars. Agis provided us with a very detailed guide to visiting Athens which proved to be quite helpful when planning our short trip in the city. Check in and out was simple. The apartment was clean and had a cool, artistic sense of style. I’d recommend to anyone looking for an Airbnb in Athens."

Located in the center of the arts district, surrounded by amazing cafes and restaurants, as well as a huge assortment of shops, this apartment was the perfect place to stay in Athens. <br/>Communication with Agis was really easy, as was locating the apartment from the nearby central Metro (7min walk). <br/>The apartment had a really comfortable bed, aircon, modern amenities (not to mention some great art on the walls!) and felt spacious and well considered. <br/>We would definitely stay here again.

22320268,528391853,2019-09-13,38782948,Carli,"The apartment is really comfortable and nice, very clean. It was really nice to have the simplicity of the space with two beds, as we didn’t spend much time there during the day. Agis is so easy and quick to communicate with, he is a wonderful host! My only complaint/warning to future renters is that the house is located in a very loud area and you can hear a lot of noice until late hours of the night, so if that bothers you, definitely bring earplugs! Other than that, it is located near so many restaurants and shopping, as well as is only a 7-8 minute was to the train station."
22320268,531242713,2019-09-17,1232965,Abigail,"The location is unbeatable - short walk to bars and restaurants in Athens.

Есть все, необходимое для комфортного проживания и даже больше - хороший телевизор с неплохой акустикой, духовой шкаф, кофемашина. Единственное - в декабре было достаточно прохладно, поэтому в зимний период захватите с собой тапочки, т.к. пол холодный и немного не хватало обогрева. Думаю, в другие времена года прохлада только в плюс.<br/>Слышимость достаточно сильная, поэтому с субботы на воскресенье пришлось спать с берушами. В другие дни - тихо. В целом, по соотношению цена-качество, вариант достойный внимания.<br/>Спасибо Agis!"

22320268,666130662,2020-09-20,116819424,Chloe,"Great location, especially if you don’t have much time in Athens. Easy walk from metro and then easy walk to all the neighborhoods we wanted to walk around. Quick, friendly communication with host, who also provided a great list of restaurants, attractions and so on. Easy check in and instructions. This was a nice touch. Bathroom good size and good shower. Overall flat well equipped, and clean. Big space for two people to relax and enjoy the stay. Handsanitiser provided. Only negative, which is not the fault of the host - we stayed on Saturday night and it was noisy. The area is great because of its central location, but it is also in an area of a few bars. Otherwise great stay."
22320268,667238724,2020-09-23,26784893,Halya,"Agis’s place was really nice and clean, it certainly does correspond the photos. <br/>The location is perfect, very central and close to many bars and cafes. However, the street tends to be  quite loud at night and it could be slightly challenging to sleep though I believe it is not a problem for all.<br/>P. S. If you need two sets of bed linen  let Agis know in advance. <br/>Agis, thank you so much for the stay!"

22320268,733587964,2021-02-22,198569962,Γιωργος,Ενα εξαιρετικα διακοσμημενο διαμερισμα στο κεντρο της αθηνας σε πολυ καλη τοποθεσια με πολλες παροχες . Ζεστος χωρος που σε κανει να νιωθεις ανετα απο την ωρα της εισοδου! Θα το προτεινα σε ολους !
22320268,765549878,2021-06-02,223327509,Chrysa,θετικά: το design του σπιτιού είναι πολύ μοντέρνο και η τοποθεσία πάρα πολύ καλή..<br/>αρνητικά: Η πολυκατοικία μύριζε μούχλα και αν και ανθυγιεινό καταλαβαίνω ότι δεν είναι κάτι που μπορεί να ελέγξει ο host. Το σπίτι ήταν αρκετά βρόμικο με σκόνη πασαλειμμένη και υποτιθέμενα καθαρισμένη σε πολλές επιφάνειες. Τα σεντόνια είχαν λεκέδες που δεν ξέρω αν ήταν γιατί δεν είχαν πλυθεί ή αν οι λεκέδες έχουν στύψει και δεν μπορούν να βγουν με το πλύσιμο. Το βαζάκι με το αλάτι είχε ξεραμένα φαγητά πάνω του. Το χειρότερο από θέμα καθαριότητας ήταν οι τρίχες από διαφορα σημεία του σώματος που υπήρχαν σε ένα πλαστικό καλαθάκι που είχε μέσα τα σαμπουάν και τα αφρόλουτρα!! Αηδιαστικό και κυρίως ανθυγιεινό!! Από θέμα φιλοξενίας με ενόχλησε ότι δεν υπήρχαν χαρτοπετσέτες ή χαρτί κουζίνας και κυρίως κάψουλες καφέ. Αυτό όμως δεν ξέρω αν είναι λόγω των μέτρων για τον Covid-19.
22320268,770365692,2021-06-14,354456808,Olga,"Great stay in the center of Athens. Location was perfect—walking distance from all the main sites. Apartment was cozy and bigger than we expected. Kitchen could’ve had more amenities, but overall we loved the place!"
22320268,390257772275443771,2021-06-22,132125297,Bryan,"Enjoyable stay and extremely helpful host. Clean, spacious apartment with a good kitchen - not that you will ever use it with all the amazing, cheap restaurants nearby. Good sized shower, perfect for a quick rinse, and the washer is extremely helpful for those hot Athenian summers.<br/><br/>Great, walkable location close to all the important tourist spots in Athens - we did not have to use any public transport to get around. Because of its locations near bars and restaurants, the street can get noisy at night, especially on weekends - light sleepers may want to bring some ear plugs."
22320268,393163782935999323,2021-06-26,40215777,William,Really cool apartment and in a great location. Highly recommended!

22320268,399034826543897229,2021-07-04,328467216,Lambri,"What I liked: super clean, had some thoughtful details ( even had some masks and even eggs and chips)..<br/>What I didn’t like: the host had to wait until 2 pm to provide me with instructions about how to check in and enter the apartment which I found a bit rude to be honest and not thoughtful. Also, he didn’t provide me with his details (name and phone number) until I asked him to do so….Maybe he thought I would enter his apt before check in time and felt in-secured.<br/>In addition, its location makes it quite noisy. <br/>nevertheless I had a good time and thank you for everything."
22320268,401143829399352133,2021-07-07,401518954,Lucia,It is a beautiful very nice apartment. The host is the nicest. It has beautiful windows and it’s very comfortable.

Old’s apartment is right in the center of Athens and was close by a lot of good restaurants and accessible to the various stores including the main mall in the area. The apartment itself was very cozy and felt welcoming immediately after stepping foot into the studio. The room is perfect for couples or solo travelers. Old was very specific and thoughtful in his messaging and touches to his place.

Nous n’avons pas rencontré Old mais il a été très disponible par message et nous a donné beaucoup d’informations sur Athènes et le quartier.

However the place is only for two as there is only one bed and some amenities are meant for two.  (We made a reservation for 3) The sofa is only good for sitting. The wifi was also super slow. So if remote work is intended, maybe this is not the right place. The host was super friendly thou, and pretty responsive! He gave a nice overview of tips for the area."

It is situated right in the heart of two historical neighborhoods, Monastiraki and Plaka, that will quench one’s needs of history, shopping, nightlife, and excellent excellent food. The apartment was very well decorated and spacious. It looks just as amazing in person as it does in the pictures.  Old was also very helpful and communicated throughly. We had a slight power outage one morning, and he quickly came and resolved the issue in no time. Check in was easy. The space comes equip with a pull-up couch that I found even more comfortable than the bed. Also, we were provided with all the necessary toiletries and more. 10/10 would recommend, wish I could stay longer!"

22321537,261286593,2018-05-06,17440133,Ian,This flat has to be seen!  It's really something special.  120 year old building with loads of original features.  We arrived for a two night stay and immediately wished we had  booked more time.  The guys who run the place were super helpful and gave us loads of great recommendations on local food and even sent us an itinerary of the art to hit and the art to miss.  We'll 100% stay here again.
22321537,270752025,2018-05-30,63983397,Gaiutra,Thanks for a warm welcome and the human touch. It’s an elegant flat in a neighborhood that reflects the contradictions of Athens in microcosm. The guide to things to see and do was indispensable. I had a wonderful stay.

22321537,288069951,2018-07-09,10841316,Alessandra,"This apartment is amazing! We stay at Stefania’s place with my family in a historic house in the middle of Exarchia, full equipped and in a great position for restaurants and bars outside of the turist ways. The city center is at 20 minutes by walk, but if you want the metro is at 10 minutes. We didn’t meet  Stefania, but we had a warm welcome to Athens from his friend Thomas with a lot of advices about the neighborhood and a bottle of wine!"

We enjoyed the close availability of trendy café's and small alternative shops. The (young) people here are friendly and accessible. If you look for an alternative for the crowded turistic areas, then this accomodation in Exarchia is a great spot. Stefania's communication is fast and she gave us good advise about our stay."

Η τοποθεσία είναι εξαιρετική καθότι βρίσκεται σε απόσταση ελάχιστων λεπτών από οτιδήποτε χρειάζεσαι στο κέντρο της πόλης! Ο Άγης ήταν αρκετά εξυπηρετικός και μας διευκόλυνε με το να αφήσουμε νωρίτερα τις αποσκευές μας αλλά και να τις αφήσουμε λίγο παραπάνω από την προβλεπόμενη ώρα αναχώρησης στο διαμέρισμα. Θα το επιλέγαμε ξανά!"
22321964,228762350,2018-01-21,7257331,Maria,"Agis was welcoming and very responsive as a host. He was always answering promptly to all my requests. He was also flexible with the check in and out times which was great because my flight was late in the evening. <br/><br/>The house was stylish and super clean and at a very convenient location. It also had a coffee machine, air conditioning and some nice treats. <br/><br/>Another note: The neighbourhood has a lot of bars, thus it is not quiet on Friday and Saturday nights. The windows are not completely sound proof, so perhaps you will not find  complete silence in the house during late evenings of these two days. <br/><br/>Overall it was great and I really enjoyed my stay! Thanks Agis!"

The small touches make you feel at home. It is within walking distance to all the tourist 'hot spots' but far enough away to feel like you have your own space. A must stay in Athens!!

Es my cómodo y tiene todos los servicios que uno espera o necesita en su hospedaje. <br/>Rescato mucho la limpieza con la que encontramos el lugar y el excelente buen gusto que tiene toda la decoración. <br/>Lo único para agregar es que nos faltaron broches para colgar la ropa y que la zona es un poco ruidosa por la cantidad de bares que hay cerca.

He has been extremely helpful and kind towards my mother and I and has exceeded all our expectations. Within 30 mins after booking our accommodation with Agis he sent us information on how to check in, places to see/things to do in Athens and doesn’t hesitate to help you at any time as he responds swiftly. It is based in the city centre of athens, only a 7 minute walk to Syntagma Square and loads of cafes/bars and shops around. It is very easy to get around the city and the apartment is a great place to unwind. He offers a well equiped kitchen with a nespresso machine, a kettle and other kitchen amenities + netflix, wifi and a sound system. The overall cleanliness of the apartment is fantastic and well air conditioned. Very modern and good taste. The price that Agis requests for the rooms is very reasonable, especially considering the location and what is provided. Unfortunately I only stayed one night so I didn’t get the chance to fully appreciate what Athens had to offer but I will definitely visit again and stay at this airbnb. <br/><br/>I hope this helps future travellers visiting Athens and that you consider a night(s) here. <br/><br/>Great time!!"

22321964,272750552,2018-06-04,40790951,Shannon,"Agis was extremely responsive and offered great local suggestions. We were only staying one night in Athens and took a morning tour of the Acropolis so the location was perfect as it was just one mile away. We have a late fight out of Athens tonight, so Agis was very kind to allow us to leave our bags in the room until we left for the airport.

He is very flexible too - Really appreciate how he allowed us to put down our baggage before the check in hours as we arrived very early in the morning. Thumbs up! <br/><br/>The apartment was very cosy and stylish - it made us feel like home. There were days where we just eat in and watch Netflix (which we were granted access too). <br/><br/>Instructions to the building were clear and the location was awesome, just a few minutes walk away from the shopping district. Would definitely recommend to my friends who are visiting Athens!"

22321964,339178594,2018-10-21,163110622,Syahira,"Agis had been a huge help even before we arrived at his place. He was always prompt with communication which made it really easy for us. We took the train to Monastiraki which was a direct line from the airport and from there we walked to the apartment. It was easy to locate using the address Agis provided. It was approximately a 10-15 min walk, probably would've been sooner if we didn't have luggage to worry about. Upon arriving at the building, we took the elevator to the 1st floor and entered using the code Agis had given. The whole process was really seamless and we were very pleased. Upon entering the apartment, we were very impressed with the decoration and ambience of the apartment. The one large bed and one sofa bed was perfect for the 3 of us. The bathroom was clean and spacious and the kitchen was also fully equipped with a stove, pots and pans. Even the TV was connected to Youtube and Netflix which we really did enjoy! The apartment building is really close to the main street, probably less than 5 minutes away by foot. However the street can get quiet as it's slightly off the main street so you should not walk back alone if it's too late in the evening. But it really is such a short distance that you would reach the apartment building in no time. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at Agis' place and would not hesitate to stay there again if we were to visit Athens once more!"
22321964,339867064,2018-10-22,150727275,Natalie,"The apartment is very cozy and has such stylish decor! It is located about 5min walking distance from the heart of the Monastiraki neighborhood. Agis gave me so many helpful tips, was easy to communicate with, and was very flexible with check in/check out. The metro station is about a 10min walk from the apartment."

Location is really strategic, 5 mins away from the shopping in monastiraki, and couple mins walk from metro stations with lift. A convenient space. The only thing was that the streets were busy throughout the night for some weird reasons, but luckily we were quite deep sleepers so it didnt bother us too much.

We got in late but the check-in was smooth, and he was accommodating of a late check out. The apartment is very conveniently located to touristy places, and a number of good bars and restaurants (we particularly loved “falafellas” - a tiny hole in the wall 2-3 mins away from the apartment). You cannot go wrong with this apartment!"

There are many good food choices around the area too. Host is friendly and respond rather quickly. It was a good experience.
22321964,358397744,2018-12-14,205741244,Lydia,Agis is quick to response to our queries and flexible to the check in and check out. We had to stay in Athens for an extra night unexpectedly and Agis kindly let us check in a night early. Also gave us lots of helpful information about Athens. Would definitely recommend and come back to this AirB&B. Thanks for having us.

22321964,364694802,2018-12-31,12376555,Yorgos,Παρα την σύντομη διαμονή μας στον χώρο του Άγη απολαύσαμε πραγματικά τον χώρο του.<br/><br/>Από την επιλογή των φωτογραφιών μέχρι τις διαφορετικες παροχές του χώρου αντιλαμβάνεσαι την προσοχή που έχει δοθεί στις λεπτομερείες. Η  προσωπικη επιμελεια όλου του διαμερισματος είναι τέτοια ώστε να το νιωθεις οικείο από την πρώτη στιγμή.
22321964,365412222,2019-01-01,44505443,Carly,Agis’s place is in incredible location! Walkable to everything & very central. Very easy check in and check out. Agis communicated everything we needed and more. We had a great stay here!

22321964,401334568,2019-01-14,4039331,Dan,Clean sylish modern studio apartment. Excellent central location for shopping and eating and an easy walk to the tourist attractions (Acropolis etc). Being on the first floor there is some noise from the street. Although we didn't meet Agis he was excellent at communicating and making sure everything was ready for us.
22321964,402083858,2019-01-17,224598816,Jw,Awesome location and Agis was very very helpful! Highly recommend
22321964,403099550,2019-01-20,30480104,Katrina,"Agis was a fantastic host! We were lucky to stay at two of his apartments on the same floor at either end of our Greece trip. He was very communicative and accommodating to our crazy flight schedules. He allowed us to leave our luggage and freshen up in another one of his apartments while ours was getting ready. Check in and out were very easy as all we needed were door codes. He provided us with plenty of great tips about the area and transportation to his place. When we had questions regarding possibly renting a car, he provided us with immediate feedback regarding nearby parking garages (we ended up not renting a car because of the difficulty... best idea). Both of his apartments were clean and had great decor. The location was fantastic!! Very close to several bars, restaurants, shopping, and easy walks to all the historic sites. Wonderful host and apartments and we highly recommend staying at one of his places!"
22321964,403581272,2019-01-21,10327188,Fofi,Thank you Agis

22321964,415604584,2019-02-23,58150128,Bartek,"The appartment is very well located and you can go everywhere on foot from here. It is modern, well equipped and comfortable. The kitchen has all you need, the toilet is clean, the room is spacious and pretty. Communication with Agis is just perfect! You can easily check-in with the code. The only downside are the leaky (porous) windows, so you can hear the street (which is not the busiest in Athens). Apart from that everything is superb! Thanks a lot, Agis!"
22321964,417133193,2019-02-26,220281411,Antonis,"The best place to stay in Athens. Everything was perfect ,clean and it has everything you need. Agis was a gentleman and very cooperative .  I could write a lot good things about this property but I would need a lot of space to write. The sure thing is that at the next trip to Athens we will be book the same apartment again. Thank you again Agi"

The place is near the center of Athen. We can walk to Akropolis in 10 to 15 mins. The decor is also quite nice. Overall, it was a good stay."

22321964,426514055,2019-03-21,98984722,Irca,"Agis’s place is great! 7 mins walk to the metro station. Not to worry about restaurants- they are all in walking distance. You can walk to syntagma squares and to Plaka. Just need to take metro and get down 2 stations to Acropolis.<br/>The apartment is so clean, fully equipped, comfy: everything you can expected!<br/>Agis himself is also very nice and friendly as he will help you with every information you need in no time!<br/>Thank you Agis! <br/>Will definitely recommend this place for you travelers!"

The studio is beautifully designed and just what we needed for our one night, close walking distance to the metro and squares. Comfortable bed, couch, bathroom with hot shower, and kitchen with oven and stove. There was also a washing machine. Agis was very hospitable and kind to provide many suggestions for food and sights. Right nearby is Clumsies, an awesome spot for dinner. Thanks so much Agis!"
22321964,432930095,2019-04-05,45242562,Annie,"Excellent value!! We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Location is amazing and we were able to walk around to everything! 5 minutes away from the Panepistimio station and 7-10 min away from the Monastiraki station, which makes airport travel via metro super easy.  Took us about 15 min to walk to the Acropolis museum and about ~20 min to Lycabettus hill. The neighborhood is very safe and we felt comfortable walking around the Monastiraki/Plaka areas at midnight. The space itself was brightly lit with a TON of outlets (but make sure to bring your own adapters if needed) and very clean. Had everything we needed, including coffee pods and a hairdryer. Agis was very prompt with communication as well. Thank you for letting us stay here!"
22321964,438192361,2019-04-16,30948487,Jia Yang,"Agis was an extremely helpful host who replied almost immediately to any queries and requests. Not only he provides information on food, drinks and places of interest, he is able to accommodate for special requests such as early check-in, and helped us in contacting the local car rental agent. Not to mention his uniquely-styled accommodation with all the amenities one can wish for. Highly recommended!"
22321964,439073142,2019-04-18,215065547,敏轩,The facilities in the room have well-equipped facilities and very clean. And it has a high cost performance. The landlord gave a lot of guides.

22321964,442263050,2019-04-23,53713991,Japleen,"Close to everything in Athens, around the corner from all the bars and eateries. Space is also stylish and Agis is very proactive in offering local tips. Windows seemed a bit thin and didn't block out all the outside noise as well. Just be careful about safety at night as it didn't feel like the safest neighbourhood, but the accommodation itself is fantastic value for money- we walked everywhere and loved the vibe nearby when the evening did come alive!"

The only flaw is that it  is a bit noisy at night."
22321964,449669981,2019-05-07,109280751,Deanne,"Stylish space in a great location, close to historic sites and great restaurants and shopping. Check in and out was smooth and easy. There was a fair amount of street noise at night, but Athens is a great city for night life and the noise is a fair trade off for being close to the pedestrian areas where everyone wants to be. We would stay here again."

We self checked-in / checked-out and that was  really good as we had to leave early to catch our flight. The neighbourhood was awesome, really close to everything, you could simply walk to Monastiraki metro station and to the Acropolis in a short time."
22321964,461200052,2019-05-31,148384807,Monique,Great location and such a beautiful place to stay while in Athens
22321964,462682599,2019-06-02,12672439,Brandon,Agis' place is stylish clean and wonderfully located. We loved the open space and the design and decor. The beds were comfortable and it was easy to get to his building by the metro. The apartment is also 5 minute walk away from the metro station. <br/>Agis provided us with great information and he was prompt in his responses to our questions.<br/>The only issue we had was we stayed on a Saturday and it was very loud and we had a hard time getting sleep. We needed earbuds to block the noise. Other than that everything was wonderful.
22321964,463404320,2019-06-03,62361243,Beatriz,We really liked the apartment. It is really easy to communicate with Agis and also very flexible time to do the checkout. The location is really near the Parlament and some of the main attractions with lots of restaurants around. Also underground 7 min by walking. I would definitely recommend it!

22321964,465636519,2019-06-08,59016670,Sarah,"Amazing place! As a solo female traveler, I'm hyper aware of safety so I was a bit nervous when the taxi dropped me off and I had to walk up a dark stairwell upon entering the building, but I felt immediately safe and secure when I walked in.  I was barely a few steps in and sent a pic to my mom (the true mark of a perfect place; if I know my mom will approve :) )   The place is clean and styled really well - I could have hung out there all day instead of exploring Athens! Agis was truly a super host- he was very responsive and provided helpful insight and recommendations about what to do and how to get there.  And he was flexible and accommodating with my check-in and out times due to a flight delay and then needing a place to leave my bags so I could explore a bit before traveling to my next destination.  I wish I would've been in Athens more than 1 night so I could stay here longer!"

22321964,467372877,2019-06-10,61290307,Brooke,"This Airbnb is modern, sleek, spacious, and clean. Don't let the building exterior fool you, the inside is a very relaxing, airy atmosphere with full kitchenette, great lounge area (the couch can be converted to an additional bed), and tidy little bathroom.  Because it is all one large studio room, it might be most comfortable for only two people,  however, a close-knit group of three or a family with small children would be perfectly fine. The location makes it easy to walk to any of the main attractions in central Athens as well as walking to and from the metro.

And everytime it was getting wet, there came a very musty smell. <br/>It also could have been a little more tidy. <br/><br/>However the apartment has offered a very central location. You can walk to every hotspot this amazing city has to offer. Everywhere around are nice Shops, restaurants and bars. Nevertheless the apartment was quiet, but sensitive. The furnishing was very modern and nice. Agis was a very kind, respectful and caring host. I can totally recommend him."

It is right in the middle of all the attractions, great restaurants and shops. Bare in mind that the location being central, it may be a little noisy until late into the night. That wasn’t a problem for us, though. I totally recommend Agis’ studio."

We felt safe in this Airbnb. Just be very careful around Athens - I got my phone stolen while at a restaurant so always be mindful! We would definitely stay here again if we return to Athens.
22321964,531722294,2019-09-18,154336191,Jara,"Agis place in downtown Athens was perfect for a quick layover between the airport and sea port. The interior of the home was stylish and comfortable. It is located in city center so there is quite a bit of exterior noise throughout the night. However the location is prime for restaurants, cafes, markets and lots of shopping. We had everything we needed within walking distance which was perfect since we did not have a car. The interior of the apartment had some nice amenities as well including elevator, smart TV, coffee maker, and washer. We enjoyed our short stay."

Vraiment aucun doute des raisons pour lesquelles il est un SuperHost.<br/><br/>L'arrivée se fait de manière simple et efficace. <br/><br/>Le logement est d'une propreté impeccable. Les photos sont très réalistes. Espace très convivial.<br/><br/>Emplacement dans un coin avec beaucoup d'action. Cependant énormément de bruit qui nous a empêcher de dormir. Musique forte qui se fait entendre des bars jusqu'à 4 AM avec les fêtards qui se font entendre toute la nuit. Si le but du séjour est de festoyer jusqu'aux petites heures du matin, cet emplacement pourra convenir.<br/><br/>Pour ce qui est de l'hôte et de l'appartement c'est au-dessus de ce que vous pouvez attendre."

The location was a short walk to the Acropolis (15-20 min), and a minute away from tons of restaurants, shops, etc. while remaining in a somewhat quiet area. Agis was an excellent host and we would highly recommend staying here! An added bonus that we weren’t expecting was a washer/dryer unit. We were grateful to have been able to wash our clothes!"

The airflow of the dryer was also strong.  The location of the apartment is about a 10-minute walk from Syntagma Square.  I was able to walk with my suitcase.  The owner's communication is very clear and quick.  I was able to use the apartment with great peace of mind.<br/>日本人でここの宿を利用しました｡宿は清潔で設備も良いです｡全体的に満足度はとても高くｵｽｽﾒできます｡ｼｬﾜｰの水はけが少し良くないことと､部屋の扉を開け閉めした時にﾋﾟｰと音が5分ほど定期的になることを留意しておくといいと思います｡"

We arrived too late to take advantage of being so close to the Acropolis, but did manage to bar-hop a  bit in Plaka. Super clean! Mattress on the bed is a bit thin, but the sleeper sofa is super comfortable. This unit is on the first floor, so you will get a bit of noise from the street. We stayed over on a Sunday night and people were out and about till midnight."

It has some of the most beautiful coffee places, bars and restaurants plus all the major sites and museums are within walking distance. One stay is simply not enough to explore them all so we will definitely return. The apartment was decorated with such a good taste. From the beautiful Framed pictures, to the plants and the nice minimal furniture. The sofa can turn into a bed, so 4 people can share the room. It was also very bright, clean and tidy. We almost felt bad we couldn't spend much time in there. Its definitely one of the best airbnb I've stayed. Agis also had some Nespresso coffee there for us and a Netflix subscription to just chill after a long day. We didn't meet with Agis but he was quick to respond and gave us all the information we needed. You can check in with a password which is always convenient and he was Also kind enough to let us leave are stuff before the check in, as we arrived much earlier. All in all a perfect experience for that kind of price. Will definitely visit again."

Η αισθητική του χώρου είναι μοναδική και το σπίτι είναι πολύ ευρύχωρο και ιδανικό για πολυήμερη διαμονή! Οι παροχές και η καθαριότητα επίσης ανταποκρίθηκαν πλήρως στις προσδοκίες μας! Εάν πρέπει να επισημάνω κάτι αρνητικό , ίσως είναι η ηχομόνωση που θα μπορούσε να είναι και καλύτερη. Το συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα!"

En todo momento la comunicación con Agis fue muy buena, con recomendaciones y detalles del apartamento, y siempre dispuesto a ayudarnos. <br/><br/>Si tuviera que poner una pega sería por el ruido de la calle por la mañana, ya que las ventanas no insonorizan bien y a partir de las 08.00h el ajetreo de la calle invade el apartamento. <br/><br/>Muchas gracias Agis por toda tu ayuda."

Aucun accueil alors que l'hôte s'était engagé à nous donner les renseignements pour obtenir un taxi très tôt le lendemain pour accéder à notre bateau. De ce fait nous avons raté l'unique navette et avons du attendre une journée complète (nous devions rejoindre un groupe sur Paros pour partir sur un voiler !!!)! quel dommage si nous n'avions pas compté sur lui nous aurions agi différemment!  Il était mentionné ""petit déjeuner"" en fait il n'y avait que 4 capsules de café. (Nous voyageons très souvent et à chaque fois nous avons eu un petit déjeuner digne de ce nom ou alors il ne faut pas écrire dans le descriptif ""petit déjeuner"". L'appartement est très bruyant (musique à fond une grande partie de la nuit) Les photos ne sont pas en adéquation avec la réalité. Le prix est trop élevé par rapport à la qualité. Entretien très moyen."

It has everything you need for a comfortable stay including very comfy towels. The only thing we struggled with was mosquitoes at night, I expect this won’t be an issue in winter but had I known I would have come prepared with repellent."
22322823,351507191,2018-11-23,50932820,Layne,"This is a great location for a seeing some of the sites of Athens.  The apartment is located between 2 Metro stations so easy access from/to airport. <br/>The apartment itself is as the pictures show. However, it was a bit smaller and had only a cupboard in the living room for putting clothes in.   The kitchen was do able for meals but with few necessities such as hot water in the kitchen sink.  An electric kettle provided the needed hot water for doing dishes. Nice touch, which I appreciated, was the Nespresso machine.   Because there are so many restaurants near the apartment for dining, and the location, I would recommend the apartment."
22322823,351857173,2018-11-24,163897648,Thuy,We highly recommend this apartment. It is located in the center and there is a direct train from the airport. Acropolis is just about 10 minutes away by foot from the metro station Monastiraki. <br/>Agis is a great host! All of his tips on restaurants and bars were very helpful. The apartment is very clean and stylish. We will definitely book this apartment again next time we visit Athens.

We mentioned there would be three of us staying but didn’t express we’d each like our own bed and thus the futon was not made nor were linens available. I shared the request with Agis late during our first night and he had his crew prep the bed for the remainder of our stay on the second day!<br/><br/>There is a small lift and stairs to the flat on the second level. We LOVED that the building and individual flat were locked with a key pad and thus didn’t require that we walk around with (and fear losing) a key during our stay.<br/><br/>Unfortunately during our time in Athens the weather was drizzly, but there’s a beautiful private patio with tons of plants that would be fab in nice weather. Instead, for recreation, we took advantage of the big TV inside to watch Hercules!<br/><br/>The WiFi and GPS connection in the flat are not stellar (slow/weak) but the GPS signal is functional once you step out on the street for navigating about.<br/><br/>Thank you Agis and friends!"

22322823,504148384,2019-08-07,5560144,Roberto,"Ottimo appartemto per una famiglia di quattro persone, facile accesso e comodità di lasciare i bagagli nel negozio vicino. In pieno centro e strategico per tutte le visite. Molti locali e supermercati intorno alla casa, unico problema se siete in macchina dovete lasciare l'auto qualche centinaio di metri dalla casa per scaricare i bagagli, davanti alla casa non cè parcheggio."

22322823,514911223,2019-08-22,27376996,Verity,"This is an amazing space, we loved it and the location was great. We had great instructions on how to get to the apartment via public transport from the airport, and loved the fact you could find so much within walking distance. Agis was very kind and let us drop our bags in early before check in time and we were also able to leave them for a few hours after checking out which really helped us make the most of the city without dragging our luggage around!"
22322823,518836392,2019-08-27,227854299,Ofra,"Great location,the best in Athens.<br/>Agis was very nice and the place was very convinient.we will come back for sure..."

22322823,525832098,2019-09-08,74647568,Darcy,"Agis’ place is great. It is very conveniently located, and it was easy to walk to everything in Athens. As the name implies, it is also quite fashionable. Check in/check out was easy. It is also upstairs in a locked building and the outdoor area is secured, so it felt quite safe. I would stay there again!"
22322823,527594993,2019-09-11,242882744,Danielle,Perfect place with an amazing host and location
22322823,528987534,2019-09-14,29424189,Joshua,Better than expected. Check in and check out were easy. Had a lovely courtyard area which would have been lovely to use had we stayed longer than one night. Would stay again and definitely recommend.
22322823,530810187,2019-09-16,13173986,Claire,A great location in an exciting neighborhood! We also followed some of Agis’ tips including a great night at the Clumsies! The apartment was really comfortable and well appointed. We highly recommend this apartment to others! Thoroughly enjoyed Athens and Agis’ apartment!
22322823,531234697,2019-09-17,173972377,Marie-Louise,"This is a fabulous find, and a gem in a very central location close to a metro station. It is stylish, comfortable and spotlessly clean and I would highly recommend it for a stay in Athens!"
22322823,532081768,2019-09-19,47718056,Kaitlyn,Awesome space with amazing outdoor patio oasis. Easy walking distance from just about anywhere. Agis was very fast to respond to any questions we had before arriving and while there - which was very comforting. Definitely would stay again!
22322823,532550267,2019-09-20,14378071,Shannon,Agis was so responsive and understanding. The apartment was just as described/pictured and easy to access with codes instead of keys. The beds were comfortable and there’s lots of space. Maybe not for 5 people for a long term rent but perfect for a few days.<br/>Would return to this place among all the shops and bars.
22322823,534891490,2019-09-23,70814876,Bip,We had a great stay.  There was plenty of shower products which was nice. The outdoor porch area was quaint.  There were plenty of places to eat close by and the area was very nice.
22322823,535833852,2019-09-25,123516626,Shanise,Smooth and easy check in process. Layout of apartment is exactly as described and shown in pictures. Apartment was also very clean. Apartment is centrally located. Easy walk to Acropolis. Agis was very responsive to all of my messages both before I arrived to Greece and while there. I highly recommend staying here!

22322823,539848102,2019-10-02,96732964,April,"Great location and a lovely apartment to stay in. Some noise from water dripping from air conditioners on the terrace roofing did wake us up at times, but there was no street noise at all."
22322823,542094518,2019-10-06,220616010,Eric,"Stay here if you want to enjoy your time in Athens!  The unit itself is modern and neat with everything you need to be comfortable.  And the location is fantastic if you want to explore central Athens by foot.  Not too close that you have massive traffic outside the front door, and yet within a 2 min walk you have access to dozens of restaurants, shopping, and a few minutes farther the acropolis and other attractions."
22322823,544127919,2019-10-09,19477297,Mark,"Cet appartement est très bien situé dans le centre-ville d'Athènes à quelques 10-15 minutes de marche des principaux lieux touristiques à visiter, des restaurants, des boutiques, bus, etc.  L'appartement est situé au premier étage d'un édifice converti, relativement neuf, bien aménagé, au goût du jour, propre et comporte toutes les facilités nécessaires.   Il y a un ascenseur et une petite terrasse.  Le secteur est en transformation et il y a beaucoup de restos et commerces à proximité."
22322823,545930520,2019-10-13,32425599,Aris,"The place was nice - good location , safe area. The experience was ok. Last day before check out the electricity was cut, so no breakfast, shower in the dark with cold water and early check out as we would stay longer without electricity."
22322823,547929944,2019-10-16,131868037,Emma,"Quart and cozy apartment. Close to restaurants, shops and attractions. Agis has excellent communication and happily accommodated our needs. Clean, airy and tidy very comfortable and would stay again!"

22322823,556334915,2019-10-29,58165810,Berna,"Agis's place is at a perfect location, walking distance to everywhere :)  His place is stylish, clean and has everything you need. The place looks exactly like it does on the pictures.    Agis was  very helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever I had any questions. He had excellent restaurant recommendations. He went way beyond to make our long-weekend comfortable and memorable.  Totally recommend it."

22322823,563261251,2019-11-12,247997978,Patti,"Fantastic location in central Athens, close to food, bars, metro and also the Acropolis. Stayed here for the Athens marathon and was close to the coach pick up and also walking distance from the finish line. <br/>Easy check in and check out, check out is 11am but Agis was very flexible and also downstairs in the cycling shop looks after suitcases for €3. Direct to and from airport, couldn’t ask for anything better location wise."
22322823,565919449,2019-11-18,17836736,Gavin,Perfect location for walking around in the city.

22322823,566958827,2019-11-21,114765766,Rain Hard,The place is really amazing specially the location. The self service check in was really accurate and we did not get any issues going in the apartment. All I can say is that the location is really good and better for traveling in groups.
22322823,567278676,2019-11-22,45207837,Pietro,"The spot is perfect for nighttime lovers, street food, and day shopping. Super friendly host, cool modern clean apartment. Really a good stay! Thank you"

22322823,571519894,2019-12-01,11266852,Epco,"Great, very stylish and spacious apartment, nice inside and outside sitting area! Good beds and furniture. Only disadvantage for us that at the night of our stay (Saturday to Sunday) there was a very loud music event until early morning which prevented a good night sleep for us."
22322823,572557945,2019-12-03,250376729,Juan Camilo,"I would recommend 100% very central area, we didn’t even had to take subway to go to the museums or the Acropolis.<br/>Host is very helpful, and the cleaner did a very good job."

22322823,576683250,2019-12-14,187768472,Angela,My friends and I stayed only for one day. Thought the location was great. Right in the center of town. Great if you’re not driving but bad if you’re driving. There is no space to park. Overall experience was great.
22322823,577267124,2019-12-15,46216562,K H,"Agis is a responsive host who answers my queries quickly and provided a very comprehensive guide to places to eat and things to do in Athens, with the web links. His place is located centrally and within 5 minutes walk to the nearest train station, and 2 stops from Acropolis. The apartment is clean and modern looking and can fit in 5 people quite comfortably. There is heating in each room and also in the living room. Highly recommendable for your stay in Athens."
22322823,578562923,2019-12-18,46216562,K H,Agis’ place was great as posted in my other review.

22322823,591042518,2020-01-10,3246045,Katie,"Location is great, walkable and super close distance to touristic attractions without being in the middle of them. Super quiet building! Host was super fast at responding to issues, i.e: the power went out and he came right over to fix it so you can count on him if any issues arise during the length of your stay!"
22322823,592554957,2020-01-13,52381464,Pieter,Nice place to stay.

Bien equipado.<br/>Está muy céntrico, cerca de metro, bus, y los principales sitios turísticos de la ciudad.<br/>Agus fue muy atento con nosotros. Tuvimos un problema con la luz, y en 15 minutos vino (a medianoche) a solucionarlo. <br/>Es flexible a la hora de llegada, ya que nos permitió entrar a dejar las maletas antes de la hora de entrada."
22322823,598505367,2020-01-27,204562214,Marcus,"Alojamiento muy cómodo y céntrico, te hacen sentir como en casa, muy recomendable para familias por la seguridad."

22322823,602522107,2020-02-07,55949950,Tunca,Great located warm home. It's surrendered by around cozy bars and restaurants. It was so easy to find and get into the apartment. You will find everything basic you need.
22322823,604018917,2020-02-10,331947714,John,It met our needs adequately. The rooms were clean and the host was very friendly and helpful.

22322823,617554380,2020-03-13,83120334,Jacob,"Agis was a great host. He was quick to respond before and during our stay. The location was perfect, near great bars and restaurants. The place was very nice but did not have room for much closet space."
22322823,617904017,2020-03-14,209122844,Kaitlyn,"Check in was super easy and our host was very good to keep us informed of the situation in Greece as we arrived the day restaurants and museums were forced closed due to Coronavirus containment.  We found no issue finding food as there were still takeaway options and our host provided us with a delivery website.  The apartment was stylish, but I wasn’t as wowed as I thought I was going to be when I booked.  Overall the apartment was clean, but cabinets and drawers weren’t necessarily.  There is also no microwave.  There is a washer, but no dryer.  The bed wasn’t super comfortable, but overall this apartment had everything we needed."
22322823,620215905,2020-03-21,40869508,Tracey,My friend and I spent one night at Agis’s BnB and it was a welcome and comfortable place to stay.  We each had our own rooms and a great living area with a good kitchen and bathroom space.  The check in process was easy and I highly recommend it to anyone needing a relaxing place to stay while in Athens.
22322823,625890625,2020-05-24,346879762,Ερμιλα,Το μέρος ήταν απίστευτα άνετο και πολύ ωραία διακοσμημένο . Θα το πρότεινα ανεπιφύλακτα !

The airbnb is what is in the photos very nice, super clean and  highly recommended we had a good time."
22322823,643200595,2020-07-27,216169727,Giorgos,A very cozy apartment in a very quiet street and at the same time 2 minutes walking away from monastiraki. A lot of places for a drink... or two... or more... right at the front entrance. There is also a supermarket a minute away for the daily needs. We loved it and will be back!!!!
22322823,645008880,2020-08-01,134778554,Sandra,Great location and comfortable and cool place!
22322823,647552944,2020-08-07,5706013,Evgenia,"Apartment is stylish, but we were expecting much more form Airbnb plus. Bed linens were old, crumpled and not really white anymore, as bath towels. In apartment two bedrooms but air conditioner only in living room, so you have to sleep with open bedroom’s door.  If you travel with friends, you have to choose between privacy and sleeping in tiny room without any air conditioning.  Neighbours were also quite noisy at night (not a host's fault, of course).  Really disappointing."
22322823,659539072,2020-09-02,29518366,Nils,"Perfect apartment for a trip to Athens. It’s beautiful, perfectly designed and well maintained. <br/>Checkin was easy, the location within Athens near to the nightlife (still quiet at the same time) is perfect! <br/>I’d love to stay here again!"

22322823,668391263,2020-09-27,14669107,Carole,The flat is very quiet and incredibly well located. The fact that you can check in late is really convenient. Agis was very responsive and helpful.

22322823,705717819,2020-11-01,47118537,Tim,"Fantastic apartment in an excellent central location. Perfect for one or two guests. The outside area is an absolute bonus and the natural light it affords works brilliantly. Agis was superb with all communication, let us have an early check-in and always love self check-in."
22322823,706382007,2020-11-03,23978547,Tal,"The apartment is very beautiful on the inside. the garden outside wasn't cared for, dirty and not maintained, so didnt wanted to sit outside for that reason. the apartment is just next to a working construction site, sometimes there is work there so it might bug you if you want to nap/work from the place. <br/>Shower pressure is quite low.<br/>Smart TV was great.<br/>Comfortable sofa and bed. <br/>Agis was super nice and helped by answering very fast, also giving us the apartment for an extra 3 hours to checkout."
22322823,706684834,2020-11-05,127956305,Angie,"We rented this apartment for the purpose of a photoshoot, he charged us 100€ more due to that and there were rubbish and leftovers in the sink. The apartment’s balcony was not as shown in the photos and some glasses were broken. Overall, it was a bad experience even though I believe that the house has good potential and it is very well located."
22322823,708130083,2020-11-11,363432911,Euripides,"A very artistic and eclectic place. We found it very cool and the courtyard garden we enjoyed immensely.

Εύκολη πρόσβαση στις συγκοινωνίες (μόλις 6 λεπτά με τα πόδια από την στάση Συγγρού-Φιξ του μετρό). Το διαμέρισμα παρέχει όλες τις ανέσεις και είναι πλήρως εξοπλισμένο. Σε μικρή απόσταση από το σπίτι θα βρείτε πολλά καφέ, εστιατόρια, ταχυφαγεία, μπαρ και παμπ, καθώς και σούπερ μάρκετ. Extra tip: για το ίδρυμα Σταύρος Νιάρχος περνάει mini bus από τη στάση λεωφορείων Συγγρού-Φιξ. Το μόνο αρνητικό ήταν το ότι το ζεστό νερό τελείωνε γρήγορα. Κατά τα άλλα μείναμε πολύ ευχαριστημένοι και θα το ξαναπροτιμούσαμε."

22330230,241706473,2018-03-10,145030570,M.,"We can highly recommend to stay here! The apartment was perfect for two people, super quiet, very clean, modern and well equipped (especially the kitchen). Just the bed mattress was a little too hard for my taste. <br/><br/>Regarding the location, we couldn’t complain at all. It’s in walking distance to Acropolis, Philopappos Hill (very nice!) and many other nice spots, bars and restaurants. There is also a supermarket 100m from the flat.<br/><br/>With Argiris and Stefano you’ll have great hosts. They send us a list of possible activities in and around Athens before we started our trip, organised our transfer from the airport to the apartment, provided a little breakfast for our first day (we arrived in the evening) and were always reachable and open to answer our questions. Thanks again for that!<br/><br/>We had a great time and would stay there again."

The flat is very clean, newly renovated, well equipped and perfect for two people to stay for a journey. <br/>The location was perfect for us: a quiet street perfect for relaxing, nice restaurants and bars around, walking distance to the Philopappos Hill (beautiful sunset spot), 15 min walking to the acropolis and other sightseeing spots. The metro station Sygrou-Fix is about 7 min walking from the apartment and the next supermarket is just around the corner. <br/>The communication with Argiris and Stefanos was great, they were very helpful and thoughtful. <br/>We highly recommend staying at the apartment!"

The apartment was perfect; it was so clean whilst the bonuses of a kitchen, balcony,  tv and fast wifi were truly great! The location too was the best part -  we loved the non-touristy and vibrant bars nearby just a walk away through a small cute park. That part of the city is green and a great place to be in it - its so close to everything but at the same time its still a 10 min/15 min walk away which means its not loud or near busy streets. Andreas is also really quick and on it with communication which was great if you need help or recommendations for anything. Would defo recommend and come stay again! :)"

Indeed, we met a very convenient and kind host, to get the keys of an astonishingly clean and refreshing flat. The location was perfect, only 15min walk from main touristic sites, without the feeling of a touristy area that one may surely experience in monastiraki for example. Nice, local, accessible bars and restaurants are only 1 to 5min walk away, as are bus stops to the beaches. The balcony is really calm, on interior court. The AC was such a comfortable feature in summer. Would go back without any kind of hesitation, and recommend as strongly as possible for a couple wishing to visit Athens while staying in a comfortable flat in a safe and lively-yet-quiet place. I honestly have a hard time finding reasonable cons to this stay."

Near you can find shops, cafes, public transport stations. If want to walk to the Akropoli, then be ready for a 25-30 mins walk but cafes after every 10 meters do this walk much easier (fresh air, shadow).<br/><br/>The flat is also great. It has all that you need to feel comfortable. Coffee machine and melded coffee from Andreas - one love ))<br/><br/>I could recommend this place and host for any future trips."

Andreas was easy to contact if we needed some help or advices. This was perfect! :)
22330230,453306965608621046,2021-09-17,107290921,Ismène,"Perfect, <br/>I spend three days with my friend, the appartement is very clean and close to the center.<br/>The hoste Andreas is very nice thank you again!"
22330230,459859188992468387,2021-09-26,274068248,Roxana,"Andreas was extremely welcoming and informative. He gave us a tour of the flat and a lot of information regarding public transportation, the neighbourhood and Athens.<br/>His flat was spotless, really well equipped and placed in a perfect location...Close to the city center (approximately 15-20 to Plaka), but away from the tourist area. It was absolutely lovely to get the real vibe of the locals and to experience a Saturday night in Koukaki.<br/>I strongly recommend Andreas's flat if you want to discover a touristy Athens and as well an authentic Athens."

22330754,310910022,2018-08-20,17004510,Stéphanie,"Une seule chose à dire ici : c'était parfait ! Mary et Carolina, à qui j'ai eu affaire ont été très réactives, sympathiques, aimables et vraiment efficaces, jusqu'à gentiment nous organiser les transferts de et vers l'aéroport. C'est une adresse à Athènes qui mérite d'être chaudement recommandée : l'appartement est non seulement bien placé mais il est encore plus joli en vrai qu'en photos, décoré avec soin et avec goût, très confortable et très bien équipé. Moderne, design, sobre mais avec de beaux matériaux et de bons équipements : cela veut dire des lits spacieux disposant d'une très bonne literie et de draps doux, des serviettes de bain XL  moelleuses, des climatiseurs silencieux, des volets roulants électriques qui permettent d'obtenir un noir complet dans la chambre pour les personnes sensibles aux rayons de lumière, de jolies salles de bain avec vasques et des carreaux imprimés façon ""carreaux de ciment"" qui donnent une touche de charme supplémentaire, tout est neuf, propre et très bien entretenu. Il y a la machine à Nespresso, la cafetière, bouilloire, grille-pain, micro-ondes, four, plaque (Website hidden by Airbnb) Netflix en plus. J'ai apprécié aussi la salle de sport au rez-de-chaussée et pouvoir utiliser la buanderie. Je n'ai pas l'habitude d'être si élogieuse, mais c'est vraiment mérité, à tous niveaux. Allez-y les yeux fermés!"
22330754,316295811,2018-08-31,27290458,Jodie,This is the perfect place to stay in Athens.

It’s very nice having access to the washers and dryers in the building. The staff is also very helpful!  It’s located in a nice, quiet neighborhood with restaurants and groceries within a short walking distance. It’s a little away from the acropolis area, but still completely walkable.

The neighborhood is fantastic, the building is beautiful and safe, and the apartment is lovely.  The unit is rather spacious (though the kitchen is a bit cramped) and comfortable.  It was nice to have so many amenities, such as a gym, printer, coffee maker, and lovely modern bathrooms with unfailingly hot water.  Communication with the property manager, Despina, was great, and she was super responsive.  Check-in was a breeze as well.  <br/><br/>There are only two downsides: first, the Wi-Fi was not good, which caused us a lot of problems since we were working from home; and second, the building has many, many AirBnb units and the walls are a bit thin, so if you have rowdy neighbors, you may hear them late in the night."

22330754,416378392912471426,2021-07-28,413468474,Yanick,We had a great stay at the apartment. Our family of five had plenty of space and the nights were really quiet in this residential neighbourhood close to the national gardens. The acropolis and other sights are within walking distance. Yet you get a feeling of “real” Athenian life. The apartment is part of a completely renovated building.
22330754,443883791917411647,2021-09-04,106705125,Vikrant,We stayed at this apartment for 4 nights. It’s very well located within a short distance from all the major attractions.

The only issue was that the lockboxes were stolen which made the check in a bit tougher. But Ekaterina made sure to send somebody to deliver the keys. Would highly recommend.
22348012,235871337,2018-02-18,67344539,Klaudia,Very clean and cozy studio with big tv. <br/>Every important sightseeing spots in walking distance. <br/>Unfortunately we shared an entrance with another studio and its inhabitants were noisy and obnoxious even at 5 am in the morning. <br/>Otherwise that wasn’t host’s fault and I recommend this apartment.

Tolto questo mi sento di consigliare vivamente di soggiornare in questo appartamento. Good Job Toni!"

Le quartier est sûr.<br/>Toni et son ami Andreas nous ont bien accueillis et nous ont donné de bons conseils pour notre séjour à Athènes.<br/>Seul petit bémol: il y a 2 bars en bas de l’immeuble. L’appartement étant au 4ème, le bruit est atténué mais le samedi soir on l’entend un peu malgré tout."

22359269,275966559,2018-06-12,178208229,Tom,"Location perfect, can walk to pretty much all of the Athens tourist attractions. The place itself, was modern, spacious, well appointed and secure. I would recommend to anyone. This was my first ever Air BNB and the experience was memorable.  Toni was very helpful and accommodating, with awesome hospitality, as we arrived at 10 pm and he has someone meet us there to give us the keys and give us a tour of the apartment. Thanks Toni, I hope to stay there again."
22359269,276511560,2018-06-14,30451366,Rachel,The place was clean and we were met to check in. Convenient for walking to acropolis and other downtown areas. Apartment building and lots of stairs but had a small lift. Was nice to have the open space to chill.

In particular, the beds were super comfortable, everything is nice and new and the location is perfect. Only suggestion I would make is to provide some bottled water and milk upon arrival. One issue we did have was that the duvet covers on the beds were wet. We hung them out once we realized and they were dry by later that evening."

22359269,284012886,2018-07-01,47967923,Kathryn,What a wonderful apartment in the heart of Athens. We stayed 4 nights and walked everywhere not needing to jump in and out of cabs at all. Close to shopping strip Ermou and Syntagma to see the guards. A hip and happening neighbourhood with multi wine bars below and fine eateries. Also around the corner from renowned artisan gelato store. This was our second trip to Athens with the kids and couldn’t have asked for a better location or hosts. Thanks for making our stay outstanding.

22359269,316307771,2018-08-31,52359594,Supremebea,"5 star experience. We were welcomed personally by an associate of Toni eventhough we were an hour late due to ferry delay. The place is big, modern, very very clean ( better than most 4 star hotels I've stayed at and the only other time i was impressed how clean a hotel/rental place was in japan), had everything we needed, super comfortable bed with hotel quality sheets and pillow, good toilettries and even toilet paper. It is literally 5 minute walk to Syntagma square. 5-10 minute walk to plaka and monastariki district. It was so near to almost all of the attractions that we didnt need to take the metro at all. We only had to take a taxi from the ferry (if you are 3-4 person it comes out cheaper and more convenient than taking a bus) and when we went to the train station going to Meteora. There is 2 wine bar within the same building and a small cafe. The terrace does not have a view of the acropolis but we didnt mind. It was perfect having breakfast out there because it wasnt facing the sun and you can stay there without any shade until 9-10am. The apartment was a bit pricier than other airbnb but the location combined with all the ammenities makes up for the price. I checked small hotel prices around that area and Toni's place is definitely half of that. Don't hesitate. Get this place. Worth it."
22359269,319388972,2018-09-06,93098822,Linda,"Toni的家真的就跟照片上一樣美,甚至比照片還要更漂亮,房子非常乾淨,設備也是應有盡有｡ 不得不說地點實在非常好,樓下有兩間生意超好的酒吧,雖然人聲鼎沸,但樓上關了窗戶什麼也聽不見｡迫不急待想要再回去了!"

Much more economical option than a hotel. <br/><br/>Apartment was spick and span, had everything we needed, including a nespresso unit. Very comfortable and spacious for our family of four.<br/><br/>Our only caveat which may not be specific to this unit: Be prepared in Athens not to be able to put toilet paper in the toilet, this seems to be a rule here and possibly in other apartments."

Toni hat sich bis ins Detail (Korres-Produkte für jede von uns, tolle Bettwäsche, super Tipps) als sehr guter Gastgeber erwiesen.

The beds were comfortable, the common spaces were large, the overall look and feel is modern with upgraded modern finishes throughout. The location was also perfect walking distance from all the restaurants and shops in the heart of Athens. It was also quiet at night so you couldn't hear street performers or loud music from the nightlife scene. I'd give it 10 stars if that were an option! Highly recommend the place."

22359269,469120854,2019-06-14,110661617,Priyanka,Our trip to Athens was the best because of the location of Toni’s apartment. <br/>Toni was such a great host and gave us amazing recommendations for food and things to do. <br/>A driver was arranged for airport transfer for 38 euros and he was the sweetest person. <br/>The apartment had everything one would need to make the stay comfortable. It was super clean and great. <br/>Our flight landed early and Toni was nice to give us early check in. That was a very sweet gesture. The location is totally on point and all major attractions are less than a 10 minute walk. <br/>I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone coming to Athens.

Toni is great to work with and made the process seamless. The only small issue was the hot water runs out fast but I feel like that is common.

The apartment offers a lot of space, is well equipped and the beds are very comfortable. A plus is the huge terrace. There are great bars and cafes right next door, which is why it was a bit noisy in the evening, but when you close the windows you couldn't hear anything. I would choose the apartment again for my next visit to Athen."

Η διαρρύθμιση πολύ καλη αν και θα μπορούσατε να έχετε ενα διπλό και δυο μόνα κρεβάτια, ώστε να εξυπηρετείται καλύτερα μια οικογένεια. <br/>Τρία θέματα που πρέπει να δείτε: 1. Το internet είναι εξαιρετικά αργό (αδύνατο να το χρησιμοποιήσει κάποιος για εργασία). 2. Στο λουτρό δεν υπάρχουν κρεμάστρες για πετσέτες, παρά μόνο μια στο ντους και μια (έτοιμη να πέσει κάτω- δεν την συγκρατούν οι βίδες) για τα χέρια. Πρέπει να τοποθετήσετε 4 κρεμάστρες για τα 4 άτομα που μπορούν να μείνουν στο διαμερισμα. 3. Πρέπει να τοποθετήσετε τις τέντες στην βεράντα. Η υποδομή υπάρχει. Είναι απαραίτητες γιατι ο ήλιος μετα το μεσημέρι καίει τον χώρο."

Acropolis is just 10-15 minutes walk, Syntagma metro station is 5 minutes. Few groceries and supermarket are close. Good mattresses and comfortable beds. Nice terrace to drink glass of wine or a beer after a long day. On downside- can be nosy,  due to bar on the ground floor(apartment is on 4th floor), but we managed to solve it by closing windows and shutters."

Doesn’t need a bus or subway. <br/><br/>Toni was able to scheduled a pickup for me and my family at the airport & also a drop off for my departure. (For a fee. A reasonable fee) <br/><br/>Checking in was a breeze with Toni’s associate. <br/>The unit is exactly like the pictures. <br/><br/>Didn’t found any problems when we’re in the unit. <br/>Everything is great.

22359269,470717022226168413,2021-10-11,347735775,Antonio,"El apartamento de Toni es genial, una zona muy buena para estar unos dias en Atenas. El huesped es muy atento. Para mi gusto solo puedo ponerle dos fallos, el primero es que no habia papel del baño y el segundo que tardo en llegar 20 min en llegar al apartamento con las llaves. Por lo demas el piso es excelente y precioso. Muy recomendable."

I found this gem while searching for a place for my parents to stay during their recent trip to Athens, and they just came back absolutely thrilled! They could not stop talking about how wonderful and personable the host is, how everything you could ever want or need was at your fingertips: fully stocked kitchen and bathroom; beautiful large and private terrace; comfortable, clean, and modern furniture...all the amenities you can't even get in a hotel! In other words, their stay was PERFECT! If there is ever a chance to go back, they (and I) will definitely be staying at Niki's place again!! Thank you Niki for taking such good care of my parents, and thank you for the parting gift!"

22363662,288638579,2018-07-10,134569436,Krista,"Great apartment with all the amenities you could ask for! The space is beautiful, new, very clean and in a quiet street (no loud noises during the evening). Androniki was a great host and helped us with luggage storage and setting up a taxi to head back to the airport. The side view of the Acropolis from the balcony is also a nice benefit- especially at nighttime."
22363662,289356642,2018-07-12,135938568,Wendy,"We loved this place for location, ease of access & Niki made us feel so welcome. Wish we could of stayed longer"

There was a nice bottle of wine and lots of snacks in the fridge waiting for us when we got there. The patio is especially awesome! There's also a really nice TV with Netflix in the apartment, as well as a washing machine (which was a HUGE bonus for us)."
22363662,312680520,2018-08-24,48736593,Jayde,"This place has everything you’ll require for a pleasant and relaxing stay. <br/>The good old fashioned saying “do not judge a book by its cover applies here!” The outside of the building and elevator is as old as the city of Athens itself jk, lol, but seriously pretty close! Once you pass through that scene of the lands before time its like walking through a portal into the future of the 21st century. The whole apartment is equipped with everything. 3 Air conditioning <br/>Units, so required during the Scorching Summer heat! <br/><br/>The bedroom becomes an Indigo night when you close all the shutters and curtains, making for the best sleep ever. There is almost no noise when you close all windows, easy to sleep and very peaceful during the day. <br/><br/>There is a Church nearby that rings beautiful bells, sending a harmonizing presence through the atmosphere! I quite enjoyed that :) <br/><br/>My favorite part of this place was the Veranda ! Brand new, open, spacious and comfortable ;) During the day one can lay outside and soak up the Sunlight! Again you are up high enough, very little noise, so wonderful ! And at night the Moon and the Stars are Visible in their Orbits and one can feel like an Ancient Philosopher studying the movement of the Higher Spheres. It is really magical. <br/><br/>However in any case, this was just my observation and anyone else depending upon their expectations could have a totally different experience. Life is what you make it in your own thought and feeling ! I really enjoyed Androniki’s place and I hope you will to future guests :) !!! <br/>Sincerely,<br/>Jayde <br/>Love Greece ! "
22363662,313217967,2018-08-25,48736593,Jayde,Only the Best !! 
22363662,319030424,2018-09-05,3575691,Shannon,Niki is just so lovely! So welcoming and responsive and kind. Had food ready for us which made the first morning so easy. The deck is gorgeous and welcoming. Terrific location for walking. Curtains very helpful for the sun. Bright and cheerful place. Super quiet for sleeping. Great part of town and terrific place to stay!
22363662,324432084,2018-09-17,76223472,Jade,What an incredible place to stay in Athens! The condo is located in the heart of trendy Psyri surrounded by fantastic restaurants and bakeries. If you are considering what area to stay in look no further... 8 minute walk from the Monastriki square. Everything in the condo was extremely comfortable - the couch is to die for after a long day of traveling and walking the acropolis. We enjoyed the balcony and the retractable awning. All of the fixtures and furniture is luxurious and we were very comfortable. The air conditioning works very well and kept us cool. The kitchen includes some special treats along with an espresso machine and dishware. The safe is easy to use. Nikki and her daughter are both hospitable and made us feel right at home upon our arrival. They answered questions quickly and we hope to connect again soon!
22363662,329498040,2018-09-29,7895732,Darlene,"First of all, the location is excellent! It is located right in the middle of monastiraki. I took the train from the airport and was right in the middle of everywhere to eat, walking to plaka, acropolis, lots of rooftop bars. Like it was totally excellent. Don’t let the ride street fool you, or the door to the apartment. As soon as you walk in you are transformed into this beautifully decorated apartment. Beautiful balcony with view of acropolis. The touches in the apartment are excellent. Niki welcomed us with a bottle of wine and treats that was exquisite in taste! After a long day of walking around Athens center, you can come back and lounge on the couch that is soooo comfy. Niki left us food to make breakfast so that was a nice touch. Really one of my best Airbnb experiences. There is heavy smoking all around Athens so you can smell when someone is smoking in the building. But I just open the patio and it is aired out within a few minutes. I recommend the Homey Bar if you are staying there. It’s an excellent option for cocktails. Cash only, no card! "
22363662,331345412,2018-10-02,165453693,Tine,We had a great stay! Niki is very hospitable. The apartment is very well equipped. Absolutely recommended.

22363662,335749682,2018-10-13,81982827,Ashley,"First off, this place is a diamond in the rough. Don’t be fooled by the entrance to the building. It’s a distraction.   Once you’re inside, you will be amazed by the scenic views from the balcony.  Niki was extremely accommodating and patient with questions. Her directions and instructions were clear and concise.  We enjoyed our time. Thank you for your hospitality! Highly recommended. Also it’s walking distance to several restaurants, bars, and bakeries."
22363662,337706766,2018-10-17,40931764,Caroline,"This is your lucky day if you choose to stay in this wonderful classy apartment.  High quality loft conversion with new fixtures and fittings, lovely fabrics and furniture.  Bathroom extras, loads of towels and well equipped kitchen with goodies in the fridge!  Comfy large bed. Sunny patio with fantastic privacy, tables and views.<br/><br/>The area is convenient for the Airport metro (near Monastriaki tube, Athinas Road exit) and all the major sites.  Restaurants and bars on your doorstep.  We walked everywhere and didn’t need the metro five day pass.<br/><br/>Best Airbnb we have ever stayed in, very highly recommended.  Thanks for a wonderful stay  xx"
22363662,339069246,2018-10-21,13765141,Carman,"Androniki’s place is stunning and is definitely one of the best Airbnb we have stayed at. The house is very spacious for 2 ppl and with all the kitchenwares and amenities you will need. The sofa and bed are super comfy and her place also has Netflix which made us just want to stay in after a long day of sightseeing. The location of the house is very central and you can pretty much walk to everywhere(Acropolis, Shopping, nice restaurants and cafes). Androniki is super nice and accommodating and try to address all my questions and requests. I will highly recommend Androniki’s place to anyone who is visiting Athens and we wish come come back in the coming future! Thanks for hosting us!"

It makes you feel like home, perfectly clean, spacious and nice decorated. It has all the amenities and more than expected. <br/>Androniki is a perfect host, kind and very helpfully. She bought extra for us a baby cot so that our child(2 years) could sleep comfortable and also a nice present for our son that had birthday during our stay. <br/>I surely suggest it for everyone that want to stay in the center of Athens in a quiet place, 2 minutes from monastiraki metro station. <br/>Thank you Androniki for everything!!!!!"

22363662,449634548,2019-05-07,125000463,Max,Androniki’s place is awesome. The pictures doesn’t do it justice. It’s beautifully designed and exceptionally well equipped. The patio is huge and the view is amazing. The location is great. From walking distance to the Acropolis. We stayed one night and we would book Androniki’s loft over anything else in Athens any time.

The location is perfect for walking to The Plaka, all kinds of shops and restaurants, and the Acropolis. The hosts made all the arrangements for our arrival and departure taxis. Someone was at the apartment when we arrived to give us keys and explain everything. It was a flawless stay. We only wish we could have stayed longer."
22363662,488620652,2019-07-15,165025195,Daniela,Thank you very much for your amazing hospitality...we felt like we were staying with family.  Niki even arranged our airport transfers.  We will be recommending your accommodation to all our friends.
22363662,508075479,2019-08-12,130141655,Prudence,"This apartment was perfect for us. The terrace is stunning, with a view of the Parthenon, a church, and the neighboring hills, with comfortable lounge chairs to enjoy the vista and ambience. The apartment (and bed!) Is extremely comfortable and tasteful, and Niki’s paintings add to the cheerful atmosphere of the apartment.<br/>Niki has anticipated everything visitors could need, from converters and chargers, kitchen and laundry equipment and maps, airport pickup and departure, Netflix and solid internet connections. The rental is very clean, and Niki is highly responsive to any requests without intruding in any way. She is a wonderful, welcoming person with an open heart.<br/>In addition, the apartment is extraordinarily quiet and private. Located close to good restaurants, bakeries, the local market and historical sites, it is a block or two from the busyness, action, and noise of Plaka. <br/>This was our introduction to Athens, and we plan to return for a longer visit to explore more of the city, and will surely seek to stay in Niki’s apartment again."

There is a full kitchen with a complete set of appliances.  You could easily stay long term very comfortably.  The area is ideal - a whole area of cafes and restaurants one block down (the very small street on the right before the main street) as well as very close to the metro and Monastiraki Square.   There is a grocery store only 2 blocks away as well.  The terrace was amazing as well and has the sun all day.  I would highly recommend Androniki’s apartment."

Communicated throughout my visit to ensure everything was well. EXCELLENT location in Monastiraki, just a couple of blocks from Monastiraki Square and the subway station. GREAT restaurants nearby. A few streets over is a cool area with all sorts of trendy restaurants and bars. I LOVE the outdoor balcony. Very private, roomy and relaxing. The apartment had everything one needs. Thanks Niki!!"
22363662,393941950082486981,2021-06-27,53421813,Alexis,"This is THE place to stay in Athens!  It has has a great location,  is a comfortable, modern space, and Niki was an excellent host.  She arranged transfers for us to and from the port and airport, and was always easily reachable if we had questions.  she has thought of every detail in the apartment...she even had coffee creamer for us in the refrigerator.  The kitchen is very well-equipped, so we enjoyed cooking breakfast every morning.  A supermarket is a 3 minute walk away, as is Monastiraki square and tons of restaurants and shopping.  The air conditioning worked perfectly...and we needed it after full days in the hot Athens temps!  We also appreciated that the loft has a washing machine.  I don't know why anyone would choose a hotel over a stay in Niki's loft.  This was a terrific value and we highly recommend it!"

22363662,433056099783335596,2021-08-20,35901502,Marta,"An amazing top floor apartment with breathtaking view of Acropolis. Best place to explore the very heart of Athens with the most vibrant spots within a few minutes walk. Extremely pleased with our stay here! On top of that, Niki is the most amazing, helpful and easy to communicate with host. Couldn’t recommend this place enough!"
22363662,461298875916036088,2021-09-28,83247721,Emily,"If you’re considering booking Androniki’s place - go for it!!! We cannot recommend it highly enough! Our accommodations here made our trip to Athens wonderful.<br/>The location can’t be beat - you’re walking distance to most attractions downtown. With a quick 15 minute walk you can make it to the Acropolis, Plaka, Archeological Museum, etc. There are endless restaurants within a quick 5 minute walk (maximum) that are well worth a visit. We loved picking up breakfast at the “pie” place on the corner called Creme Royale. We also loved getting a sit down brunch just down the street at Just Brunch. We were close enough to Plaka that we could easily stroll there for an evening dinner reservation - or eat locally closer to the apartment. The nearby good food options are endless! <br/>When I tell you the terrace will make your trip 10x better - I mean it! We spent so much time on the terrace at all times of day - morning coffee, mid-day hiding from the scorching sun, and evenings to enjoy the sunset and Acropolis views. The terrace is what makes this apartment truly magnificent and stand out from other Airbnb options in the area. It was our favorite aspect of our 4 day stay here. It’s absolutely huge and comes complete with a small bistro set, two reclining lounging chairs, and 4 seater outdoor dining set. We spent a ton of time out on the terrace! From the terrace you have a direct line of sight to a small rooftop bar down the street. It’s called The Artist and we highly recommend it! Walk into the lobby to make a dinner or bar reservation and enjoy the rooftop atmosphere with a cocktail in hand. <br/>The couch is the comfiest thing in the world. We fell asleep there often after long hot days in the sun. And the A/C is a godsend! It works so well and kept us cool when we came back melting from being outside. <br/>Lastly, Androniki is a spectacular host. We were in Athens on our honeymoon and she left us a sweet treat and bottle of wine as a welcome gift. She arranged private transportation for us to and from the Athens airport (about a 30 minute taxi drive). She was quick to answer questions and provide recommendations for her favorite local spots. She met us upon arrival to show us the apartment and welcome us to Athens. She was a joy to work with and a really great host to stay with!"

The apartment is well-equipped, with a great layout for a couple. You will want to spend a lot of time on the large balcony,"
22363662,468588829300714471,2021-10-08,125449577,Brody,Very clean place in an excellent location. Niki had great communication and was very helpful in getting us a taxi from the airport.  A bottle of wine and some water was left for us which was nice.  We also used the espresso machine every day and it was really nice to have that in the room.  The bed was very comfortable with one small note that the pillows were not the best. The rooftop balcony is spacious and very pretty. The only thing to note is don't expect much of an Acropolis view. You have to walk to the edge of the balcony and look through a mesh grate to see the Parthenon. Overall this was a great place to stay with a friendly host and only a few minutes walk from a lot to do. Would stay here again!
22370617,222972353,2017-12-31,141585482,Zinat,"I had a very nice stay in Stefan's apartment - everything was very new and clean. The apartment is located in the second floor of a nice building with elevator. The next tram station is only one minute walk and the next metro station only 4 minutes walk away. From there you get to the main sights within 2-3 stops. I would definitely stay here again.<br/><br/>Спасибо Штефану за гостеприимство . Квартира абсолютно новая и чистая:) огромный плюс для девушки с огромным чемоданом  - лифт ! Трамвайная остановка находится минута ходьбы от квартиры, а метро 4 минуты. Обязательно вернусь :)"

Its very convenient with flexible 24 hour check in and check out so I had no time pressure at all. It is only 3 minutes walk from the next metro station and from there I could reach the Acropolis within two stops. I also enjoyed the fast internet connection and the great help and communication with the co-host Kleio!<br/><br/>Уже второй у Штефана , но в другой квартире ! Можно в любое удобное время сделать чек-ин и аут) что очень приятно :) станция метро находится в пешей доступности и до Акрополиса. Быстрый интернет - маст хев нашего времени :) Клео всегда на связи, если нужна какая-то помощь. Очень рада, что ещё раз остановилась у Штефана !"

22370617,249924933,2018-04-03,118345655,João,"We spent 1 week in this house and we could not be more satisfied! Really close to the center, either by walk or public transports, clean and cozy with all the essential stuff at hand. There are also some nice spots for food or drinks really close by. Perfect for 2 people. Kleio and Stefan were super kind and always willing to help! They are awesome. We are really glad we chose this lovely apartment. We totally recommend!"
22370617,251152132,2018-04-07,6679788,Jordan,"This place was unbelievably perfect for me and my girlfriend's stay in Athens. The apartment was cozy with new, clean amenities. Not to mention, the management of this listing is Airbnb hosting at its finest with the added privacy and convenience of self-check in, but the host still kindly touched base with us to ensure all was well. It is walking distance from all of the main tourist sites and close to many restaurants and convenience stores. The Wi-Fi was high speed, the showers were hot, and the bed was comfortable. At this value, you simply could not get a better experience. We are so glad we stayed here in Athens and you will be too!"
22370617,254786786,2018-04-18,162816244,Zita,"We spent 10 days at this place. The location is great (easy to find, close to the metro and tram station) and the hosts are very friendly and helpful. You can communicate with them easily and they respond immediately.<br/><br/>The appartment was nice and clean but the air was VERY bad. It was as if somebody smoked in there for decades or cigaratte smoke was coming in from neighbors... but like all the time.<br/><br/>We are both non-smokers and at night when you cannot leave the window open it was even difficult to breathe. (in the summer I guess you can leave it open and it might help) The host gave us an air freshener to solve the problem but of course it didn't help. I mean it helps with the smell but the quality of the air remains the same.<br/><br/>So it was really bad FOR US. If you are smoking or just spend 1-2 nights there maybe you won't even notice it.<br/><br/>Also there is a HUGE market on the street next to the building every Saturday. If you stay here and it's Saturday I highly recommend going there :)"

22370617,260558482,2018-05-04,100498355,Daniel,"If you're staying in Athens to visit the sites, this is the place to stay. <br/><br/>It's cheap, private and within a 30 minute walk of almost every historical site you could see in Athens. I stayed for 4 days and use it as my base point for my adventures out being able to come back and chill off during the warmer hours with the fridge and air conditioning. <br/><br/>Other reviews said that the apartment smelt of smoke but I didn't really smell any, although there is some from the neighbours apartments but it doesn't get in this one. <br/><br/>Must mention also, there's an awesome restaurant over the road open from 8pm-4am that serves great greek food. They have an English menu if you ask but I made an arrangement where they'd just cook me a random meal each day to try and it was so good! <br/><br/>My only issues really were that there's a balcony but you can't open the shutters and the leg room when on the toilet can be quite tight. <br/><br/>If I was back in Athens I would definitely stay again!"

22370617,265205567,2018-05-16,36686057,Gabriela,we stayed 3 days in this little apartment situated in a calm area. very close to metro station. easy to reach also from the old center of athens and Acropole in less than 20 minutes walk. Supermarket and bakery downstairs.<br/>Our host Kleio was very nice and answered all our questions in minutes.<br/>I recommend this apartment for short and unpretentious trips in Athens.

"
22370617,274059500,2018-06-08,181048218,Felicitas,"Stefan was a really nice and kind host! My friends and I felt really welcomed. The apartment is in a walkable location to the Akropolis and the Metro Station is really close.<br/>However, it should be rented only to two people because it is too small and the mattress on the floor is really uncomfortable. Furthermore, the house is noisy and due to the bad isolation, you really hear everything! <br/>Apart from that, the apartment was perfectly clean and communucation was excellent!"
22370617,280453878,2018-06-23,132085406,Vivianne,"Very clean and cozy apartment. During our stay, we were able to walk to many main tourist attractions (about 20 to 30 minutes to walk to the Acropolis and Plaka area). It was also very close to the red line and walking distance to the green line. The neighborhood/building was quiet and more residential. Our host Kleio was extremely helpful and quick to respond!"

22370617,411362307,2019-02-12,84285063,Lida,"The apartment was clean and the check in and communication worked well and easy. And for that price you can clearly not expect luxury. One less star, because as a frequent airbnb user I try to avoid staying in places that are only ment to be rented out, because I don’t want to support the lifting of local rents."

The metro station is only a two minute walk away, which made it very easy and convenient to get around in Athens. You can even reach Acropolis on foot within 20 minutes, if you are in the mood for a walk. The area makes you feel like a local, with supermarkets, pharmacies and restaurants just around the corner - there is even a cloth laundry store directly next to the apartment, if you stay for more days. Kleio was a great and amazing host and made us feel welcome from the first moment! Highly recommended"

It is also a leisurely 20-25 mins walk to the Acropolis.  The apartment is well furnished, cozy and has air-conditioning which is perfect for summer!  Kleio was an amazing host with extremely quick responses and happily answered all queries we had prior to and during our stay.  For an authentic Greek dining experience, check out the restaurant directly opposite the airbnb - everything on the menu is delicious and the owner/chef is beyond hospitable! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend this place!"

22370617,464275410,2019-06-05,28719501,Puneeth,Beautiful place very near to the Metro. 2 stations from Acropolis. Super market very close to the house. Very clean with all the amenities. Good for a couple with a baby. The host is very helpful in providing tips about the city. We and our little boy enjoyed the stay at Athens and the stay was so perfect.
22370617,465695964,2019-06-08,18857829,Nitzan,"The staying was nice, however note that the apartment looks better in the pics than in real life, (at least in my opinion): in the pics it is well lit, however note it's artificial, as there is not a lot of natural light.<br/>Hosts were very responsive and very kind in the messages. Specifically, I feel I was treated well by Kleio. On the other hand, they ask not to take their towels to the beach, and offer towels to rent for this matter in 5 euros - the same price I *bought* a towel downstairs.<br/>Last thing - before you check out and leave the keys inside the apartment, make sure the door at the entrance to the building is not locked, otherwise you may get locked inside the building - like I was just before my flight - until I knocked on neighbors doors."
22370617,470523271,2019-06-16,128722582,GaGarn,"the place is sparkling clean, Kleio is very attentive and recommends such good insides of Athens.  Please try the local restaurant right in front of the apartment, totally my favorite meal in Athens so far, Giogio, the chef is super nice and his pork wrap is the best.  So good that I have to go twice during my stay !"
22370617,484617835,2019-07-09,134437099,Zaida,"The hostess was amazing she answered our messages very quickly and always made sure were were doing okay. She went beyond the expectations! She organized a pick up car and the driver dropped us off at our location. She also gave us an itinerary of things to do in Athens. The Airbnb is very closed to the metro line and the tram. Everything was sparkling clean, the place was perfect for us."

The location was in great proximity to the metro and reasonable walking distance to sites like the Acropolis (15-20min).

Το μπαλκονακι που διαθέτει είναι σε φωταγωγό που ""επικοινωνεί"" με τα άλλα διαμερίσματα οπότε μπορεί να τύχει να υπάρχει ένα ζητηματακι φασαρίας (όχι σε σημείο που  να είναι ανυπόφορο).

22370617,403302994669236411,2021-07-10,274051698,George,"Stefan and Teo are genuinely interested in their guests enjoying their stay, regularly reaching out to check whether everything is as expected."
22370617,408434167132947004,2021-07-17,405433757,Luise Georgiana,A dissapointing experience.
22370617,416408036172641300,2021-07-28,109362112,Kristína,"Staying at Stephan’s and Teo’s apartment was very nice. We liked the place. It is little bit smaller than we expected but it is quiet, clean and good located. Also, communication with Stephan and Teo was easy and fast, both are very helpful and nice. We recommend to stay there, supermarkets, tram and metro stops and great restaurants are in walking distance. And who like to walk, it is possible visit the main landmarks walking too. And I can’t forget to mention nice driver they sent us to take us to the airport for good price. Thank you again!"
22370617,420065106002554614,2021-08-02,112591987,Brian,"What a little gem this place was – it’s incredibly close to pretty much everything. A little pastry shop/café. a wonderful local restaurant, a little grocery and general necessities/amenities all within two or three minutes walking distance from the place. The place was also well connected via public transport – metro, bus, tram and the area and general felt incredibly safe. The hosts were wonderful and assisted us whenever we needed. We had a problem with the fridge on the first night we arrived and Theo came and replaced the very next day - couldn’t recommend it more if I could! If I go back to Athens, I will definitely consider staying here again! Thank you!"
22370617,422920469181491084,2021-08-06,348417840,Κωνσταντίνος,ένα κατάλληλο σπίτι για επαγγελματικό ταξίδι!
22370617,425021243477162856,2021-08-09,142001766,Josh,Great space in a fantastic location. Tram stop is 1’ walk away; then only 20’ to the beach and 5’ to central Athens. Superb communication from hosts & they couldn’t have been more accommodating when I needed to cancel half the stay. Highly recommended.
22370617,448294438225254842,2021-09-10,263940942,David,"We found the location every bit as advertised. The appearance of the unit was very pleasing, and the supplies provided were more than adequate. The unit was spotless. The neighborhood wasvery pleasant. There was great access to public transportation. <br/>However, the access code sent was incorrect, and, as we arrived late in the evening, this was a bit of an inconvenience. She had to make two phone calls to get the code and found the co-host less than helpful in acquiring the code. The wall bracket on which the shower head was mounted was broken so that she had to hold the head to take her shower. There was no hot water available for her shower, even after letting it run a bit to see if it would warm up; she had the choice of an ice cold shower on the cold setting or a cool-water shower on the hot setting. Access to silverware was via an open tray above one’s head—when my wife attempted to take the tray down from the cabinet to see what was available, a knife and corkscrew almost hit her in the head. Storage that was only accessible by stepladder seemed a bit of an inconvenience. The internal manufacturer’s label on the oven was still on the door, making us leery of heating anything in the oven for fear of fire or melting the label. <br/>Other than the shower and kitchen issues, however, we found the stay pleasant and the location wonderful."
22370617,451895308642087679,2021-09-15,27655808,Katalin,"They are very good hosts.  Everything is nearby, shop, metro, tram.  The house is quiet, the neighborhood is safe.  The alartman is nice, tidy.  The hosts answer all questions quickly, very helpful."

Для приготовления пищи есть всё необходимое, также удобный стол, стулья, кондиционер, фен, утюг, удобная большая кровать, чистая постель. Горячая вода круглосуточно, всё по мелочи тоже есть. Квартира на втором этаже, 3 минуты остановка на море, на Синтагму. Советую."

22380263,238095668,2018-02-25,144619390,Matthew,The pictures dont do justice for how nice this property is. We stayed for 4 nights with 2 couples and it was perfect. Everything is brand new and the locations is in walking distance to everything you'd need to do in Athens. Very modern amenities and we felt very safe. We were met right outside of the apartment with a saved spot for our rental cat. All the locations and recommendations for food were amazing. The really made our experience of Athens much better having a place like home to come back to at night. Highly recommended!!

È inoltre dotato di tutti gli elettrodomestici che si possa immaginare ed è perfettamente equipaggiato. Cucina molto comoda e perfettamente attrezzata, la zona living molto accogliente, il bagno è splendido, le camere sono perfette con materasso estremamente confortevole. TV in ogni stanza con Netflix e sound system ovunque. Il quartiere è in riqualificazione con gente tranquilla e locali dove si mangia bene a buon prezzo. La zona è inoltre molto comoda per i mezzi pubblici (metro dall’aeroporto in 45 minuti circa) e per la vicinanza all’Acropoli (10 minuti a piedi)ed a Syntagma (15 minuti a piedi). La strada in cui è il palazzo (il venerdì mattina c’è un magnifico mercato della frutta e verdura) è tranquilla come tutto il quartiere, fuori dal traffico caotico della città. Infine John è molto simpatico, disponibile e giustamente molto orgoglioso del suo appartamento. Grazie John! Il tuo è stato il miglior appartamento che abbiamo trovato sino ad oggi "

Ioannis was friendly, timely, and supplied us with great recommendations for local dining. He has thought of everything. The area around the apartment is quite but not too far away from the restaurants and historical sites. We set up car service for our airport ground transfer through Ioannis’s recommendation with Ioannis (same name, different guy). This service was also amazing and worth it! Ioannis, the driver, gave us additional insight to Athens and was a pleasure talking with. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in Athens, better than any hotel!"

We were in Athens for 2 nights as a short stop between Rome and Santorini, and it turned out to be one of the best stops in the trip, much because of this apartment. <br/><br/>John was a spectacular host. He gave us accurate directions from the airport to the apartment and met us there to check us into a newly renovated living space.  Believe the hype, this place is beautiful, resembling the modern stylings seen in magazines or TV.  It is spacious with 2 bedrooms, and even has a washing machine for laundry.<br/><br/>The location is great, close to all the major historical sites, as well as the popular neighborhoods like Plaka and Monastiraki.  There are great places to eat near by as well.<br/><br/>If you will be in Athens and want to be close to all the action, stay here for sure.  Great host, amazing apartment.  Value can't be beat. Hopefully he won't raise the price anytime soon, but even he does, it will still be worth it."

22380263,415210615,2019-02-22,1839210,Bauke,"This place far exceeded our expectations!! It is THE place to stay when you're visiting Athens. Ioannis was helped us park the car next to the apartment by saving a spot for us, helped us bring some bags to the apartment, gave very good instructions about the place (which were not many, but there are always a few). It's at walking distance from the Akropolis complex, shopping facilities are around the corner, and on the day we left (a Friday) there was a fruit+vegetables market in the neighboring street. We stayed there with our two small girls (<4 yrs), and they loved it as well. It's always good to include a point of critique, but the only thing I can think of is the few stairs (approximately 3+6) that form the access to the building, which forced us to lift up the stroller. We did not mind though, as the place we were staying in is so great!! Highly recommended for your stay in Athens, also for more than the few days that we stayed there."

From our pick-up at the airport (using Ioannis’s taxi driver friend, also Ioannis - totally recommend taking up Ioannis’s offer to arrange airport transfers - extra cost but worth it - his friend gave us heaps of great tips of places to go to whilst in Athens) to check-in with Ioannis everything was seamless which was appreciative after a minor disaster with transfers in Dubai.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is just as beautiful as the pictures.  Clean and well fitted out.  Great shower with awesome water pressure.  Great wi-fi.<br/><br/>The location is great as well.  Perfect for exploring Athens especially if you are only there for a couple of days.<br/><br/>Overall, no complaints whatsoever and I would totally stay here or any other place hosted by Ioannis should I ever visit Athens again in the future."

22380263,505401895,2019-08-09,27421684,Reonel  [Joon],"This is one of the best AirBNB we have stayed at. We booked it for 8 days for three adults. Air conditioning worked well during the heat wave in August. Ultra-modern and very clean. It’s in a residential neighborhood but only about 10-12 minute walk to the new Acropolis Museum or Plaka. Lots of really good restaurants in the neighborhood for breakfast, lunch or dinner. John was in constant communication with us. We will stay here again when we are back in Athens! 5 stars!"

Glad we picked this AirBNB."
22380263,397483716287206740,2021-07-02,8672058,Michele,Great apartment.  Appreciated the excellent working air conditioning units due to the extreme heat outside.  Had coffee pods and coffee for the machines so our mornings started out easy.  The apartment was close to great restaurants and the Metro was not a far walk.  We also used the washer almost daily which was very convenient and very much needed.  Ioannis was very easy to get ahold for recommendations and arranged a super reliable driver when we needed it.  Also liked the extra secure lock up system.  Highly recommend!

Had some loud construction unfortunately directly above us start on our check in day so we opted to move to another location, but as a super host myself I would not hesitate to recommend this host and location when the construction is finished. The host was very understanding and credited us back."

22396361,310827467,2018-08-20,73759656,Erden,A bit off to the center but great place to stay. Commute is not a problem with the bus and metro. very close Agios Georgios where you can see the whole Athens from the hill.
22396361,320199351,2018-09-08,179085217,Anne-Laure,"Ada's place is half an hour away from Athens center by walk, located in a calm neibourhood. The room is really clean and Ada is always here to help and give you advices on places in the city!"

22396361,327609015,2018-09-24,176587669,Gabriel,"Ada was easily the best host I have encountered since I started using the app. She is smart, generous, kind, and VERY knowledgeable of the surrounding area. The apartment is absolutely gorgeous. Additionally, she was incredibly accommodating with the check-in/check-out times. I cannot put into words how strongly I recommend this apartment."
22396361,331338500,2018-10-02,213471711,Kyle,"My girlfriend and I had an awesome stay at Ada’s place. The apartment is very relaxed, comfortable, modern and clean. There’s lots of great art and books around to enjoy or stimulate your intellect; sometimes I felt like just chilling at Ada’s place and enjoying the good vibes. Ada was an excellent host and always made us feel comfortable and was flexible to let us do things our way. She’s also a very intelligent, open-minded, and interesting person and we had some great conversations on topics ranging from film, literature, and psychology to politics, history, and economics. The location is good in that it’s fairly close to the center of Athens (about a thirty minute walk, which was good for our budget) but walking the streets back late at night can feel a little tense. However, we remained totally safe and I’d say the positives definitely far outweigh this one negative. So in the end, I highly recommend!"
22396361,339200878,2018-10-21,13113062,Julie,Ada is a lovely person and she really made us welcome despite being very busy.  I hope we meet again one day!
22396361,340179058,2018-10-23,51218253,Ben,Ada was absolutely lovely. Her place is Modern and homey. I felt welcome as soon as I walked through the door and Ada and I talked about countless things all weekend. I can definitively say that this has been my best experience with AirBnB. Ada gave great recommendations and made me feel at home. I can't say enough good things about my time here.
22396361,359809692,2018-12-18,206672798,Marco,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

22396361,491306562,2019-07-20,592082,Karen,"Ada is a true local and knows a lot about the arts and culture in and around Athens. Although her place is not in a touristy area, you feel like you are living in a local community. The walk to the top of the hill with the church is tough but well worth the hike, the views are best in Athens! Taxis are easy to find 5 Lampardi. Lots of interesting shops and cafes near to Ada's place. Her books and art tell a special story about her life and the richness of arts and culture in Athens, for which there is abundance."
22396361,542024048,2019-10-06,32336353,Agnes Dewi,"Ada place is nice but the location is on a quiet and hilly area. It was a difficult to find taxi so we need to 'climb' the road with our luggage to the main street before we can stop a taxi<br/>Aside of that, the rest is ok"

The flat is surprisingly quiet for its location (I used an eye mask and slept well) and has an effective kitchenette. The host was  quick with their responses and left us basic breakfast food (eggs, fruit, tea) and there are a couple of mini marts and a bakery nearby. This felt like we were living like locals."

22406502,334041960,2018-10-08,101919845,Nathan,"The overall quality of the apartment was OK but the main issue we encountered was the fact that the apartment was situated next to a busy street. <br/>Unfortunately the bedroom window did not close therefore the noise coming from the street was quite unpleasant. The only thing dividing the bedroom from the street was the retractable sun-blind which offered no sound insulation. <br/>The bedroom needs proper double glazed windows for security and noise reduction. <br/>Other than this the apartment is quite comfortable, well located and affordable."

Παρόλο που φτάσαμε σχεδόν 2 ώρες αργότερα από την επιτρεπομενη άφιξη το σπίτι δεν είχε καθαριστεί ακόμα με αποτέλεσμα να πρέπει να περιμένουνε άλλες 2 ώρες εκτός σπιτιού.  Ενώ είχαμε κλείσει διαμονή για 3 άτομα κλινοσκεπάσματα υπήρχαν μόνο για 2 με αποτέλεσμα να πρέπει να ενοχλήσουμε κ πάλι τον οικοδεσπότη μας. Η μπαλκονόπορτα επίσης θα πρέπει να αντικατασταθεί άμεσα!  Η φασαρία που έρχεται από έξω δεν περιγράφετε!  Η τηλεόραση κολούσε και σήμα κινητής τηλεφωνίας υπήρχε μόνο μπροστά στην μπαλκονόπορτα!  Τουλάχιστον ο κύριος Γιάννης,  ο οποίος δεν μπορώ να πω αν και άρρωστος όπως μου είχε αναφέρει προσπάθησε να μας βοηθήσει όσο καλύτερα μπορουσε, ήταν πρόθυμος να μας επιστρέψει ένα μέρος των χρημάτων ως αποζημίωση."

Also, the flat was very clean indeed! The only thing that was off-putting was the fact that the window in the bedroom was old and it could be a bit loud at times. Nevertheless, it is a nice and cosy flat which i would recommend. Owners were also quite efficient in communication with prompt replies."

22406502,424696450,2019-03-17,89576616,David,"El apartamento está situado un poco lejos del centro pero nada que impida llegar andando en 15 minutos. la zona en la que está es una zona muy segura. relativamente cerca también hay una zona de restaurantes y pubs. además está muy cerca de la subida a la Acrópolis. el apartamento en sí es grande y tiene todas las funcionalidades necesarias. cuando hemos estado nosotros no funcionaba la televisión porque no tenía conectado el cable pero no nos importó porque no nos interesaba la televisión griega. la parte negativa del apartamento es que el baño es muy pequeño aunque está muy bien aprovechado, pero a la hora de moverte tienes el peligro de golpearte con los brazos y el mobiliario. también el aislamiento acústico es un poco deficiente así que recomendaría llevar tapones para los oídos aunque realmente no es una zona muy ruidosa. la cama es grande y cómoda."

22406502,431930796,2019-04-02,207594094,Kristiana,"Superb stay. Great location. 10 min walk to Acropolis and Plaka. If you're into the toursity stuff. Great shower. Just off the main road, thus at night I kind of struggled to fall asleep, regardless of the small traffic I would stay there again. Showers were pretty good. Better than at my own place. Spotless Clean. 2 AC units (one in each room). There is a TV (never used this though). Communication was on superb."
22406502,437763981,2019-04-15,249355908,Maxime,"Logement propre et bien situé (20min des attractions touristiques). Les hôtes sont très réactifs! En revanche la rue est bruyante et la fenêtre de la chambre sans double-vitrage, les nuits étaient donc compliquées sans boules-quies. Pour le chauffe-eau, prévoir 30min d’attente avant chaque douche."

22406502,452456462,2019-05-13,50469133,Marek,"Nice flat close to many tourist attractions and restaurants. The area is safe and there are some shops and cafes nearby. Good place to stay if someone plans to take a boat from Piraeus in the morning as it is located less than 10 minutes from two metro stations. Noise outside the flat, especially in the morning (even with a closed window), might be a problem for some people but it was fine for us."
22406502,458657371,2019-05-26,33135609,Katie,"We enjoyed our stay here! The location is great for exploring the city, and there are lots of amenities near by, such as coffee shops and grocery stores. We felt safe walking home late at night here. Since the location is so central, there is a lot of outside noise. The photos do make the place look more spacious than it is, but the bedroom does have room and the kitchen and bathroom are updated. If you’re not going to be spending much time in the room, it’s perfect! It has all of the basics, is in a great location, and is very clean!"

22406502,474585850,2019-06-23,32644029,Teresa,Great apartment near the centre with all amenities one could wish for. To Thissio it’s around 10-15mins walk (a little uphill) through a safe & clean street.

The Apartment itself was sparkling clean, in an ideal location walking to the metro. Check in was nice and smooth, WiFi was very fast and the beds were very comfy."
22406502,536260816,2019-09-26,4882738,Clément,Très bon séjour à Athènes dans cet appartement. Prêt dès principaux sites touristiques et dans un quartier calme.
22406502,537745602,2019-09-29,50102914,Georgios,"Central located, very nice and clean apartment, for couple or family.<br/>You can go to Acropolis and other historical sightseeing by foot and it's near most restaurants,cafes,bars, clubs and so. Just choose one and go.<br/>I would recommend it to everyone for stay!!!"
22406502,545395951,2019-10-12,201325687,Kevin,Check-in was super easy and quick.  Location was not far from the main areas in Athens (approx 10-20 mins walk).  Apt was very clean and modern.
22406502,549009927,2019-10-18,137662045,Κωνσταντίνος,Ένας χώρος πολύ κοντά στο κέντρο μόλις 5 λεπτά από το σταθμό του Θησείου ... είχαμε ένα θέμα με την κίνηση του δρόμου διότι το υπνοδωμάτιο βρίσκεται ακριβώς δίπλα αλλά το ξεπεράσαμε ! Όλα καλά !
22406502,554986443,2019-10-27,299754181,Elpida,Ευέλικτοι και με κατανόηση.. Απίστευτη διαμονή.
22406502,557122839,2019-10-31,191627164,Stephanie,"Codeathena’s place is very updated and is walking distance from Acropolis. As a single female traveler, I felt relatively comfortable walking back at night which is always great. There’s a cafe next door which I didn’t get the chance to visit, and a small grocery store just around the corner. For those who need to print boarding passes, there is also an internet/printing shop nearby. The apartment itself was clean and updated, with the only exceptions being the dishes which were not the cleanest and required cleaning, as well as the bedroom window which needed a curtain. For the bedroom window, it’s ground floor so I found this important, there needs to be a better curtain. The one up currently only covers half the window and is sheer, meaning people can see in and sound is not blocked at all. Lastly, I think this may have just been a mistake for my booking, but I was not told about the water heater being turned off nor where to turn it on, and it took half a day to get a response on that. For guests coming in, there is a switch box right next to the main door (switch to the top left is for the water heater). As for criticisms that’s about it. The place was perfect size for 1-3 people. I saw that one of the futons was a bit broken so I wouldn’t surpass that count. It’s close to where you want to go, but far enough from most of the noise. Would recommend."
22406502,560232868,2019-11-06,46645207,Dimitrios,Very good
22406502,560870401,2019-11-08,100026022,Heii,The place it’s ok ! You can walk to the touristic places but is kind of far to walk with luggage although you can always take a taxi. If you need an early check in or save your luggage before or after your stay ... this is NOT THE PLACE for you since they don’t help you with that. <br/>Check in is easy since they leave you the keys and you don’t have to wait for a host !
22406502,562007326,2019-11-10,3770000,Marie,"Appartement très pratique situé dans un joli quartier d'Athènes peu visité et plutôt branché.<br/>Proche de l'Acropole et des principaux points d'intérêts touristiques.<br/>Le seul bémol: prévoir absolument des bouchons d'oreilles car l'isolation phonique avec la rue est assez mauvaise.<br/>Pour le reste, nous avons passé un excellent séjour!"
22406502,566388113,2019-11-19,283582058,May-Lynn,"The apartment is okay. But there’s a lot of noise from the street while sleeping and the bed was hard. It’s in walking distance from the acropolis, but too far fron the centre."
22406502,569657251,2019-11-27,288329406,Klearchos,"Το διαμέρισμα είναι μοντέρνο και εργονομικό.  Βρίσκεται σε πολύ ήσυχη γειτονιά και αποπνέει ασφάλεια.  Μπορείς εύκολα να φτάσεις στο κέντρο με τα πόδια (20 λεπτά για Μοναστηράκι, 25 λεπτά Σύνταγμα) και γενικά μετακινηθήκαμε μόνο πεζή.  Υπάρχει πολύ κοντά όμως και σταθμός του μετρό (Κεραμεικός), όπως και πολλά καταστήματα εστίασης και διασκέδασης στην περιοχή Γκάζι.  Εξαιρετικό και το μικρό καφέ που βρίσκεται στην ίδια οικοδομή."

22406502,609499910,2020-02-23,45037953,Hillary,"This unit is in a good location for walking to the Acropolis and some decent places to eat. It was smaller than I imagined from the pictures. Four of us girls shared. One bed was essentially a futon in the living room. A small double mattress and twin futon were in the bedroom. The twin was uncomfortable as it had a hard part down the middle where the futon unfolds. An additional mirror would have been helpful as the small one in the bathroom was hard to share. A coffee maker was provided, but no coffee.  All in all, this would be a nice space for a couple on a budget!"
22406502,611096552,2020-02-26,7493300,Sibylle,"Absolutely fine value for money, close to the sights and to the lovely neighbourhood of Petralona. The hosts are very attentive - even though it’s self check-in which can be handy if you arrive or leave at early hours. Nice details like some pasta and rice in the kitchen, super comfy bed. Not quite as stylish as it looks in the photos (the typical Airbnb phenomenon), but lovingly equipped. Only drawback is that the road next to the house is very busy during the day and noisy. No problem at night though cause there is close to no traffic during night hours. But for an afternoon siesta, bring earplugs. The bathroom is tiny, but well appointed. The kitchen/living room area can feel a bit claustrophobic cause there is just a small door in the back leading to a tiny balcony in a very narrow courtyard, so not much natural light, but if you are not planning on staying inside a lot and mainly need a place to sleep that is very central and affordable, it’s a fine choice."

The apartment has a nice size for 2 people, was clean and is located in a nice area, where you can walk to the main attractions (entrance to Acropolis eg. 25-30 minutes). The walls are quite thin, so if you're sensitive to noises in the house or traffic, you should bring earplugs :) we would definitely book it again"

There is a cute little grocery store right down the street and everything is very accessible! The apartment is right by the street so you can hear the cars and trucks going by but it didn’t bother us.

Arriving at the apartment we already noticed that a glass shelf in the bathroom was really loose, the second day It fell down  and the glass broke. Someone came the next day to fix it. The keys broke (thankfully on the last evening). Location was good with many little cafes nearby and close to the Akropolis and Metro Station! Though as the apartment was on the first floor it was really loud with the traffic, and the balcony doors did not close sufficiently."

One of the most vibrant areas of the city is in walking distance from the apartment, there is also a grocery store and a bakery nearby!

The flat has a good location right next to the metro and especially the parking opportunity at the side of the building is great. The accommodation is large, clean and well equipped. The Wi-Fi was fast and reliable, the water (in the shower) was warm and the kitchen was suitable for cooking. We especially liked the panini grill. The recommendations for Athens and the surrounding area that Demi and Spiros wrote to us were outstanding and the communication was quick and uncomplicated. Check in via the key box was also unproblematic and easy. Thank you!"

22414700,231440176,2018-02-01,513509,Robert,"Lilly's place was very nice, clean, and modern. There was very loud music playing often around the apartment but overall I enjoyed my stay and would recommend the apartment to anyone who wanted to stay in Athens for a while."
22414700,232953427,2018-02-07,60589762,Naomi,"The flat was very nice and looked exactly like in the pictures! The kitchen was functional and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was nice, though not very well ventilated. We've had some problems with the water heater but Lilly was very reactive and helpful.<br/><br/>The flat is approximately 10' walk from the metro station and 1' away from a supermarket. It is located in a non-touristic neighbourhood. It is not too far from Omonia, so you just want to be careful when walking back home.<br/><br/>I would totally recommand this flat!"
22414700,235874872,2018-02-18,18329744,Nathalie,"I loved Lilly's place, it was clean and beautifully decorated! Communication was excellent! I definitely recommend this place!"
22414700,240538900,2018-03-05,27527274,Juno,"Die Kommunikation mit Lilly war super, die Wohnung ist sehr modern und überdurchschnittlich sauber. Die Lage ist ganz ok, zu Fuß ca. 15 Minuten in die Stadt, jedoch fühlt man sich als Frau in der Gegend recht unsicher auf Grund der Obdachlosigkeit und der Drogenabhängigkeit. Ansonsten waren wir aber sehr zufrieden und würden wieder kommen! :-)"
22414700,241993287,2018-03-11,173541034,Vojtěch,"The appartment is really nice and well equipped. Communication with Lilly was good and fast, you will get some tips how to get to the appartment from the airport and also other tips. We can recommend this appartment. Good value for this price."
22414700,244671305,2018-03-19,127010042,Cara,Thank you very much for everything. We enjoyed our stay a lot. Apartment was in mint condition (super clean). There was nothing to complain about. We loved the candles!!!

22414700,249339651,2018-04-02,27081857,Ilka,"We had a very good time in Athens. The apartment is nicely furnished. However, it was quite humid. Our clothes always felt a little wet and the towels didn’t really dry.<br/>The communication with Lilly was super easy. Walking distance to Monastiraki was about 20 minute walking.<br/>Thanks for the stay, Lilly!"
22414700,251524441,2018-04-08,17723380,Svenja Marla,"We stayed in this apartment for six days and can recommend it. It was as stylish and spacious as on the photos and had everything we needed. The communication with Lilly was really good and easy! We were given the option to store our luggage in the office but in the end we could even check-in earlier.<br/>From the apartment it is possible to walk to the city (20-30 minutes). We recommend going to Viktoria metro station rather than Omonia, which is known to be a rather dangerous place especially at night. The neighbourhood of the apartment should be considered, but once we knew which streets to avoid (e.g. Aristofanous) it was okay.<br/>All in all we would stay in the apartment again!"
22414700,253018583,2018-04-13,87923534,Quentin,Magnifique appartement bien situé!
22414700,253763598,2018-04-15,60089569,Jun Jie,Lovely place for a couple. The location is great as it is within 10 minutes walk to the metro station.
22414700,256969427,2018-04-24,9768192,Sanne,"The TONI’s concept is great and the apartment looked exactly like the pictures. I would definitely recommend other travellers to stay in one of the TONI’s apartments in Athens. However, the apartment we had (in Omonia) was not situated in a good neighborhood. If I’ll visit Athens again, I would choose an apartment in a better neighborhood. Nevertheless, we had a great time during our stay in the well-equipped and beautifully designed apartment."
22414700,258997687,2018-04-30,51528542,Adélie,"Very cosy appartment, nice design ! 10 minutes walk from Omonia metro station. <br/>The guy who welcomed us was very nice et explained us everything we needed to know. <br/>Would definitely recommend !"
22414700,260804946,2018-05-05,120466271,Sebastien,Very clean and modern apartement. It is just as described. Communication was easy with the host and she was always willing to help. Less than 10 minutes walk from Omonia metro station. Very convenient close to Athens’ main attractions. Recommended.
22414700,261864222,2018-05-07,78893355,Irene,Nice apartment with all necessary equipment. Lilly was very helpfull in everything
22414700,264528056,2018-05-14,33309210,Jessica,"Die Wohnung ist super schön, sauber und mit allem ausgestattet was man braucht. Auch die Verkehrsanbindung ist ziemlich gut, man läuft ca. 10 Minuten zur Metro und ist in ca. 30 Minuten (zu Fuß) direkt in der City. Unterwegs kommt man an vielen Geschäften zum bummeln vorbei. In der kleinen Straße, in der die Wohnung liegt, ist ein Theater und ein Restaurant, auch sehr schön alles. 5 Minuten sind es zum nächsten Supermarkt also alles top. Der Weg von der Metro zur Wohnung selbst geht so ... Lilly selbst ist eine gute Gastgeberin, mit Check in/out hat alles wunderbar geklappt und auch über den Metro Ausfall an unserem Abreisetag wurden wir von Lilly informiert. Jederzeit wieder!"
22414700,265468124,2018-05-17,112319250,Tim,"This place was a spot we wanted to rest our heads at night and it was perfect! It was a modernized space with lots of room! The bathroom was awesome with a big walk in shower. Overall it was a steal of a deal! It took about 3-5 Euro by taxi from the downtown area of Athens and was out of all the hustle and bustle of the city! We were able to walk around the town but i suggest waving down a taxi! There was a great cafe just round the corner with very good ""freddo cappuccino's."" There were some minor fixed needed with the bathroom down not shutting well and shower water going out on the bathroom floor, but for the cost and the convenience of the AirBnB we really enjoyed it and was great to come home to every night. I would stay here again if visiting Athens for sure! <br/><br/>Our host met us there on arrival and if you arrive before check in there is a location to drop off your bags before meeting the host at the Location later on and allowed for us to check out the city a bit first! <br/><br/>Overall exactly what we expected and highly recommend it if you don't mind not having an Acropolis view! (also if you don't mind lots of graffiti outside, its everywhere in athens!!)"
22414700,267604356,2018-05-22,167321471,Halima,"The only reason I have put 3 stars because the area is not a nice area. Yes it’s a 10min walk to the metro but after 9pm which we found out for ourselves and from locals telling us you do not want to be walking around in the omonia area and unfortunately the flat is positioned on a alley that the cab can not pull directly outside the door and every night there was a group of druggies hovering around. I’m from London and not the nicer parts but this is completely different I was told that London is way more dangerous and it may be but being complete honest seeing Syrian refugees everywhere was very uncomfortable, staring at you doing drugs and on our last day leaving the apartment in the morning right outside the door a man who looked very disturbed was running and screaming and 2 men had hold of him and was beating him up. Katherine who showed us the flat on the first night was absolutely lovely and she said she grew up in this area and after 9pm she said herself she would only get a cab when it gets dark. The apartment is lovely but better locations are available definitely. Lilly as a host was great quick responses and very helpful."
22414700,268489912,2018-05-25,110544149,Alba,Excelente departamento<br/>Muy buen ubicado.<br/>Me encanto estar ahí.<br/>Gracias
22414700,270789676,2018-05-30,41401515,Attila,"The place is great, well suited for a longer visits. We never used public transportation during our stay because almost all the sights are located within 30 minutes by foot. It's also a quiet place most of the time"
22414700,271770338,2018-06-02,46947916,Marius,"It was a very nice stay. Stylish apartment filled with love for the details. Great welcome & introduction. Very quick and helpful response on our questions. <br/><br/>The location is good. It’s not in the very center, but all hotspots are close and reachable by foot.<br/><br/>All in all, it was awesome."
22414700,274074024,2018-06-08,6815890,Matti,"I like the decor. This was new to stay in a place that was one of a hundred apt. created by the same designer. I expected Air B n Bs to be run by individuals and not a large organization, which I guess is not bad, but felt more like a hotel than a b and b. I had not stayed in a place that asked you to turn off the hot water after every use and the no paper rule in the toilet was unexpected."
22414700,274907305,2018-06-10,7314171,Adrien,"Lilly’s apartment is really clean, well-furnished and cosy. It is about 15 minutes walk away from Athens hyper centre. We arrived to check-in in the middle of the night. According to the ad, there is a little fee for that which is very convenient when your plane arrives at 1am. Last, communication with Lilly is very good, she is very easy-going and she answers quickly. I highly recommend to rent it ! <br/><br/>L’appartement de Lilly est vraiment propre, bien aménagé et cosy. C’est à 15 minutes à pied de l’hyper centre d’Athènes. Nous sommes arrivés à son appartement au milieu de la nuit. Comme indiqué dans l’annonce, il y a un petit supplément pour ça, ce qui est vraiment pratique quand ton avion arrive à 1h du matin. Enfin, la communication avec Lilly est vraiment bonne, elle est arrangeante et répond rapidement. Je recommande hautement la location de cet appartement ! "
22414700,276622874,2018-06-14,95973706,Mike,"Great place quite, beautiful clean and comfortable. Restaurants in the area which are fantastic Ikriti, Kalamaki, and a bit further away but absolutely worth the visit Cookaki. <br/>Really enjoyed our stay, use the public transport it’s easy and cheap <br/>Mike"
22414700,284013521,2018-07-01,189993024,Dustin,"Lilly’s place was absolutely fantastic. The gentleman that I met to show me the apartment was extremely helpful in showing me around the apartment and giving great local recommendations. The hospitality was absolutely fantastic and the continued communication was definitely appreciated. I felt like I was at a 5-Star hotel.  The apartment was stunning, and very efficient. I definitely trust Lilly and any of Toni’s places as you are certain to be treated with care and professionalism."

22414700,293812870,2018-07-21,38101094,Steffi,"Die Unterkunft ist sehr schön und verfügt über alles was man braucht. Das Einzige was vielleicht einen kleinen Minuspunkt darstellt, ist, dass vor der Tür gerne mal der ein oder andere Junkie sitzt und sich eine Spritze gönnt. Sollte man damit ein Problem haben, ist es vielleicht besser sich eine Unterkunft in einem anderen Viertel zu suchen. "

I highly recommend this accommodation. our negative points were the frequentation of the neighborhood and the noise (only on Saturday night, the other nights of the week we had no problem). thank you for everything!! worthy of an excellent hotel!"
22414700,314615472,2018-08-27,56114456,Lydia,Lily's place was much better than expected - it has everything one needs and is within walking distance from the major tourist attractions and restaurants. 
22414700,315549516,2018-08-29,126452490,Iosif,I highly recomand the apartement. It is such a cleam and cozy place that will make feel like home.
22414700,316364916,2018-08-31,26296002,Hannah,Fantastic stylish apartment in central Athens. Only issue was the surrounding area which was described to us as a “poor area”. Thus we kept our wits about us. Nonetheless was a fantastic and well maintained property. 
22414700,323684006,2018-09-16,30921522,Astrid,"Heel fijn en proper appartement! De beschrijving en de foto's komen volledig overeen met de werkelijkheid. Lilly antwoordt steeds heel snel en volledig. Het enige minpuntje aan onze reis was de buurt waarin het appartement is gelegen. Zeker naar de avond toe, leek het voor ons niet zo veilig om nog over straat te lopen."

The host gave us some good advice to enjoy the city as a local and before our arrival the communication between us was perfect (so reactive) ! I totally recommended it !"

22414700,352938854,2018-11-26,131474916,Maisie,"Overall, this it has been a pleasure to stay in this modern, clean and cosy apartment. As said before, the location is a bit further out of the city and in a more urban area, with lots of locals. However, this does not take away anything from this great apartment! It is near to many great sites and a 15-20 minute walk to the main square, with lots of shops and amenities near by. If you are adverse to a bit of walking, taxis are very cheap costing around €5 from the centre and are very very easy to get. We have had an amazing stay here and would recommend to anyone thinking about coming to Athens. The interiors of the apartment definitely provide a bit of luxury on a budget!"

It takes 10minutes by walk from Omonia station, which is 2stations far from city center. Anyway, I really want to recommend this room. It was sooooo nice!"

22414700,367128804,2019-01-04,105410196,Marijana,"Very cozy and super clean apartment. Located in city center, close to everything. However, the neighborhood is full of immigrants, so it’s not safe to walk around, but Taxi is super easy to arrange via application and very cheap since the appartment has great location so minimum fare charge of 3,5 EUR applies to almost any location you head to in downtown area. <br/>Lily was a great host, super kind and punctual. We enjoyed our stay."

22414700,422519561,2019-03-11,4875196,Cezary,Great apartment with high standard.  Coffee express great! Very cosy and useful living room and bedroom. Location could be better - in the evening many immigrants in the neighborhood.
22414700,433277544,2019-04-06,164013525,Laszlo,"Lilly's place is an absolute gem. It's in the heart of Athens, most of what you'd want to see in the city is a 30-minute walk away. <br/><br/>The apartment was clean, beautifully designed and full of little attentive details, like coffee pods and local, Athenian bathroom products. The neighborhood was silent and calm at nights, vibrant in the daytime.<br/><br/>But, the best thing about the place was the host team. Lilly was quick to answer our questions and she was helpful during the planning phase of our trip. We didn't meet with her when we were there, but her friend, Tenia checked us in, and she was awesome. Like all caps awesome. :)<br/><br/>She took the time to orient us in the city and offer us some sight-seeing tips, as well as a handful of restaurants and bars that are not the typical touristy places. We ended up checking out most of her recommendations and having a great time.<br/><br/>Seriously, Lilly and Tenia gave us our best host experience on Airbnb, so far. Thanks again, ladies!"
22414700,434989961,2019-04-09,228142146,José Carlos,great everything . They are the best option in Athens.  Congratulations

22414700,437162176,2019-04-14,5925825,Siham,"We had a lovely time at Lilly’s apartment and would definitely rent the place again! The apartment was well isolated and everything was perfectly clean and in order upon arrival. It was a bit further to city center than we expected, but it was a nice 20-25 min walk and the taxi was very cheap. Would highly recommend the place!"
22414700,440044469,2019-04-20,74590176,Ανδριανα,"A great place to stay, very close to bus/metro station and city centre also. It was clean, cozy and quiet. I think that the room lived up to the photos that are shown. About the neighborhood I noticed that some weird guys walk around during day and night but I never felt a feeling of danger."
22414700,442743808,2019-04-24,167415047,Romane,The appartement is great! Lilly’s friend was perfectly on time to welcome us and gave us a lot of information about Athens. The appartement is at a walking distance to almost every touristic place and is near a metro station. It looks exactly like the pictures and is very nice. The neighborhood is a bit scary at night. I would definitely recommend this appartement to a couple or a group of friends but not to a single traveler. (and the wifi is very good) <br/>Overall we had a great stay!
22414700,445900353,2019-04-30,75916344,Claude,"L’appartement de Lily est parfaitement conforme aux photos et celui-ci est assez proche du métro Omonia. <br/>Tout est très propre ,joli et confortable."

22414700,452493763,2019-05-13,172185981,Juan Andres,"El apartamento se encuentra impecable, realmente es muy espacioso y práctico. Lo único complicado es que hay que tener cuidado cuando volves de noche ya que en la cuadra donde está ubicado se reúnen personas a drogarse."
22414700,457068880,2019-05-23,234759382,Myriam,L appartement est conforme aux photos et très agréable. Il est à environ 10 minutes du métro et bien situé pour les visites. Cependant certaines rues à proximité sont à éviter car peu rassurantes.

22414700,464197648,2019-06-05,263284131,Jonathan,Mauvaise localisation. Loin des attractions. Quartier dangereux. Plusieurs chauffeurs de taxi nous ont déconseiller le secteur. <br/>Mauvaises expériences avec des gens drogués même dans le jour.<br/><br/>Sinon la communication est excellente et la précisions des directives aussi..
22414700,468671487,2019-06-13,3807612,Jongchan,"Hello people,<br/>Before booking this place, please consider that this place has<br/>Very  strict policy for a refund. Even if you don’t think you are going to change ur plan. Please consider that. <br/><br/>Also the owner has refused my<br/>Request of changing the date because i have requested one day before the check in. Yes, i know it’s late request but for the owner, it’s better than nothing. Also the owner has asked me to cancel my booking even though i dont get any refund so that he can get a new guest. What???? He said that i could get partially refund if anyone books. But in airbnb, it says i dont get any refund when i tried to cancel. So i think he was trying to mock me."

The location is very close to the metro and convenient for visiting all the attractions. But as is typical of most of the center of Athens there are some undesirable elements, which is a price you have to pay for being close to the attractions."

22414700,498670877,2019-07-30,38856551,Laetitia,"Logement très mignon, avec les ustensiles nécessaires. Le lit est très confortable. <br/>La station de métro est a 10min à pied et elle permet de rejoindre les activités principales en quelques minutes seulement. <br/><br/>Cependant le quartier ne semble pas très sûr et sécurisé, surtout tard le soir. Nous étions pas forcément rassurés. Et la climatisation faisait un bruit pas possible... <br/><br/>Autrement tout s’est bien passé, nous avons passé un agréable séjour."

22414700,515010180,2019-08-22,64259875,Campbell,"Lovely apartment. Very modern and comfortable. Area is central (15mins on metro from Acropolis), albeit a little rough. Lily organised taxi from airport and to the port which was very helpful."

22414700,527077721,2019-09-10,51596911,Anna,"The Apartment is close to the center and this is cozy, clean. The only inconvenience is that in the area where we meet we met several people consuming drugs at the doorstep, this made us be rude to return home at home walking from the center. Even so, we had no problem with anyone. This situation is common in some areas and neighborhoods of Athens unfortunately"
22414700,528508104,2019-09-13,134794528,Han,Great!
22414700,529697576,2019-09-15,53609556,Janic,very nice and clean apartment - the location is near the center but not very touristic. The neighborhood has a lot of homeless and drunk people - but we never had a problem with them.

22414700,616900565,2020-03-11,123016955,Tomáš,The flat is modern and clean. We were missing a cutting borad and sharp knives in the kitchen but the rest of the equipment was good (we really appreciated the Nespresso machine). The locality is fine compared to what Athenes offer. We rate 5 stars (as the owner asked us to do... but we would do it anyway:)). Btw you can't flush toilet paper but it´s probably in most places in Athens.

The city center is only about 10-15 min in taxi or you can use the metro which is pretty close too. Toni was a great host.

Pillows and bed are uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Then we came, air condition did not work totally in living room and very bad in bedroom. 2 nights were awful. After engineer came and changes frion in bedroom. But in living room it was more serious problem and owner send me a message that he can give us airfan. In Athens it was +35C. It was terrible to stay without air conditioning.<br/>"

22418016,317332436,2018-09-02,29385407,Tabitha Shekinah,"Toni’s apartment was really nice and clean. Fairly near the centre of Athens, but in a slightly quieter part of the city right next to a metro station (so getting about was really easy). We found the shop opposite the apartment super useful and it made cooking at the apartment very easy. <br/><br/>Travel to/from the airport was also easy and being a quieter neighbourhood allowed us to leave the hustle and bustle of the city centre in return for a quiet and peaceful sleep. Air conditioning throughout made the apartment made it a very comfortable place to relax when not out exploring. Highly recommended."
22418016,320550188,2018-09-09,14002854,Avinash,Toni's place was perfect. We had a nice time at Athens.
22418016,321347542,2018-09-10,11606558,Aisha,"The place is lovely, the location is perfect and within walking distance from cute restaurants, bars, coffee shops and a grocery store across the street from the building. Toni was really helpful and communicative, he had a friend meet us to help with the check in. She helped us get situated and gave us some great suggestions for the area! The apartment is nicely done and clean and spacious. We loved staying here, it made our trip even more memorable!"

22418016,325538134,2018-09-20,194713239,Blake,Extremely clean Aprtment located just minutes away from the Acropolis.
22418016,327708142,2018-09-24,179084032,M,"Great apartment! True to pictures. Toni was a great host! The apartment was within 10 mins walk from the metro station. Not only that, the supermarket is only 3 mins walk from the apartment. The lift was a little scary thou"
22418016,329587925,2018-09-29,206954162,Richard,"From the beginning the communication with Toni was excellent. My partner and I were on the island of Paros and had to leave on a ferry a day early due to bad weather conditions and when I messaged Toni to see if we could change the booking he had it all sorted in a matter of minutes without a problem and was able to have someone meet us for a late check in of 1:00 in the morning.<br/>The apartment itself is in a great location two train stops away from the Monastariki area and has a supermarket across the road. Very clean, spacious and comfortable for two people and I can not recommend enough, excellent value for money too"
22418016,329966538,2018-09-30,55398739,Laurentiu,We are there for only for one night but I can say that the place is amazing. Strongly recommended.
22418016,331953486,2018-10-04,195552117,Shira,"Location about 5 min walk from metro and a minute walk from grocery store, very clean and compact, we enjoyed the house very much and Toni was so helpful as to give us so many places to visit"
22418016,334081964,2018-10-08,1532066,John,Toni's apartment is great. Renovated and very clean. Spacious. Petralona is a great area with many restayrants and bars araound and really near to center. Taxi for Syntagma cost 5 or 6 euros. Metro station is 2 minutes away from apartmeent. A supermarket is located opposite the apartment. Toni is great at communication and I strongly suggest staying at this appartment
22418016,340175543,2018-10-23,219931012,David,"Very conveniently located next to a metro station. We were a little worried about possible noise from the trains, but it was perfectly quiet. Nice apartment with coffee and tea available."
22418016,341577044,2018-10-27,13380406,Estel,"Toni's apartment was spotless clean, quiet and comfortable, especially the bed! The area is perfect if you wish to stay somewhere that isn't swamped with tourists but still close to the city center. Petralona is full of nice restaurants that are neither overpriced nor serve ""fake"" Greek cuisine as it might happen in other, more touristy districts. We highly recommend staying here!"
22418016,344321325,2018-11-03,221206785,Kathryn,"Flat is opposite a local supermarket and some independent shops and cafes, and a very short walk to the train station. Only 1.40 Euro to get to travel for 90  mins around Athens.  Gets you to all tourist destinations really quickly. Flat is lovely, on 3rd storey, but lift in working order.  Nice clean sheets, bed soft and extras like towels and shower gels - all good. Good value for money."
22418016,347891743,2018-11-12,4521759,Panagiotis,"Beautiful, well-designed, modern and well located apartment 50 meters away from the metro station in an amazing neighbourhood. The sensation i had while staying there, was like in a professional airbnb, a lot of amenities, everything inside was brand new and an eye for detail and among everything for cleaness. I would comeback and would recommend this place anytime."
22418016,351306649,2018-11-22,61609123,Dominika,"The apartment was just as pictured on AirBnB, I would recommend and stay there again!<br/><br/>Thanks again, Toni!"

22418016,361333106,2018-12-23,109683063,Sofia,It was a good apartment in a very convenient neighborhood.
22418016,366228832,2019-01-02,209671363,Zoe,Όλα ήταν υπεροχα
22418016,367650130,2019-01-05,1969154,Heng,"A surprise find in town. Toni is a pro host, he replied fast and super punctual. <br/><br/>The flat: It is very clean. Modern furniture with concrete floor and minimalistic design. <br/><br/>Location: Very close to the Filopappou Hill, good for outdoor exercise or going via there for a 15 mins walk to get into the city center and the Acropolis while having olive trees and a lot of amazing flower along the path. Would be perfect for those who know the city well, want to avoid the busy crowds and just like to enjoy the nature and relax. <br/><br/>This winter here is colder than what I have prepared for, as I was hoping it to be a bit warmer by the Med; so do bring yourself an extra pair of woollen socks if you are here in the winter. <br/><br/>Thanks again! Would try to come again to see the summer here would be amazing to see the nature nearby then ;)"
22418016,368516274,2019-01-07,80512345,Michael,"If you want to visit Athens and be a breath's away from the centre and Piraeus, this is the flat for you. Three minutes walk from the underground, with a huge supermarket right across the road to keep the budget low and a number of shops and coffee shops if you want to relax before or after you go out for pleasure or business or both."
22418016,404246215,2019-01-23,229448829,Ειρηνη,"Ωραίος , ξεκούραστος χώρος δίπλα απ το σταθμό του τρένου, πρακτικό και εξυπηρετικό διαμέρισμα"

22418016,416229922,2019-02-24,200324947,Froso,"I liked the apartment, I felt it like home. Beautiful space and the bed was very comfortable. The house was 2 minutes from the train station in a safe area and there was a supermarket right across the street. The hosts were very helpful and they replied to my messages quickly. When we asked for second sheets they brought them in approx. 30 minutes. The only disadvantage was that the floor was cold even if the apartment was warm. I would choose this apartment again."
22418016,421798407,2019-03-10,246373523,Sofia,"Beautiful, extremely clean, well-designed, modern and well located apartment 50 meters away from the train station in an amazing neighbourhood.

The apartment was very clean, warm and close to everythings (supermarket, metro station, some café and taverns) the neighborhood was safe and very calm!!  I definitely recommand him!!! Thank you so much Toni !!"

22418016,430729133,2019-03-31,48684582,Peter,Op een paar minuten loopafstand van de Metro gelegen keurig ingericht en zeer net appartement. In 10 minuten met de Metro ben je in het centrum bij alle bezienswaardigheden. Appartement is recent gerenoveerd met alle basisvoorzieningen en wat extra's zoals Nespresso met cupjes en andere zaken.  En keurig netjes. Prima uitvalsbasis voor een aantal dagen bezoek aan Athene!!
22418016,432201317,2019-04-03,151205228,Alkis,Τέλεια όλα μπράβο
22418016,437849105,2019-04-15,145175090,Gülce,Everything was perfect.
22418016,440614776,2019-04-21,12052430,Виктория,"Все хорошо, кроме штрафа за заселение после 23:00. Дополнительно 15€"
22418016,442698317,2019-04-24,158715638,Paulius,"Amazing hospitality and a hassle free experience from start to finish. Stylish apartment with a good location if you have public transportation in mind. Even though the metro is nearby the place was very comfortable, quiet as well as cosy. All of the necessities were provided so we had extra time to enjoy our stay."
22418016,445328624,2019-04-29,391867,Rodrigo,"Great place! Away from the hustle and bustle of central Athens but with easy access to everything with the metro being literally across the street. Buy a weekly metro pass and Athens is at your doorstop. Toni’s place to the Acropolis - 30 min by foot through a beautiful park (where you get to see where Socrates was jailed for corrupting the youth!), or 10mins by subway which costs 1.4 euro. Having a grocery store across the street and washing machine in the apartment a definite plus. Would stay again - highly recommended!"
22418016,449632502,2019-05-07,41728463,Christie,"Very cozy apartment, next to Petralona station, super markets, cafes and restaurants! Quiet place and very very clean! I totally recommend it!"
22418016,456645586,2019-05-22,17199844,Christina,"Stylish modern apartment, just a 3 minute walk away from Petralona station (which is only a couple stops away from all the main attractions!), you’re central yet away from the hustle after a day of sight seeing. If you’re a super light sleeper, you may hear the metro at night but it’s not loud at all considering how central the apartment is (my boyfriend couldn’t hear it at all). <br/><br/>Toni is a great host, quick to respond and provided some toiletries and tea etc. <br/><br/>Tip: If you’re staying a few days, you’ll be using the metro at some stage I’m sure, so you’re best bet is to grab a 3 day travel card which will enable you to get around easily combined with travel to the airport (bear in mind that metros direct to the airport come every 30 minutes or so, factor this in to your journey)! Also you must try the first restaurant on route to the metro to your left - all the locals hang here. It’s a great spot! <br/><br/>Have an amazing time. If you’re looking for clean, comfortable, and central with a great host, look no further!"
22418016,461805426,2019-06-01,7623635,Christoph,"The flat is nice and clean, and the location is great. The metro and a lot of restaurants are very close by. You need just to cross the street to reach a local supermarket."
22418016,463917724,2019-06-04,217402528,Anne-Claire,Schoon en nieuw appartement. Dichtbij de metro waardoor je snel in het centrum van Athene bent en bij de haven. <br/>Tegenover het appartement is een supermarkt en een paar gezellige restaurants.
22418016,472214869,2019-06-19,25966246,Sandy,"Great host, fantastic apartment located in nice, local neighborhood just 2min walk from metro and 20-30min walk from historical sites such as Acropolis/Museum and popular neighborhoods (ie. Plaka, Monastiraki). <br/><br/>Apartment is a great size, spacious, clean, and comfortable! Has kitchen and microwave too and right across from supermarket. <br/><br/>Bed is very comfortable and blackout blinds available as well as couple lighting options in bedroom. <br/><br/>Shower is great but requires you to turn on hot water for around 25-35min before using but plenty of hot water.  <br/><br/>Extra linens and towels provided, as well as individual toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner and body soap. <br/><br/>Toni also checked in during my stay and provides a local guide on the table for the area. Great communication and nice local tips! <br/><br/>Definitely loved this awesome apartment to live locally and would highly recommend this location for a quieter, enjoyable local vibe."
22418016,475312637,2019-06-24,1816856,Sanderson,"2 min walk from train station, super market across the street. Used key box  after hours check in without any issue. Place was very clean, A/C was cold and wifi worked well."

Teniendo en cuenta que el verano en Atenas puede ser muy caluroso.<br/>Muy cerca del metro que te lleva al centro de la ciudad y si no te molesta caminar, es solo media hora de caminata para llegar que se hacen super fácil.<br/>Definitivamente volveríamos a ir si pasamos por atenas de nuevo"

22418016,524463513,2019-09-06,96732000,LJ + Thais,Toni’s place was 100% everything that was described in the listing. The Airbnb was only 1 mile (2.2 km) from the Acropolis. Literally a 2 minute walk to the train station. Right across the street from a grocery store. The location was perfect. We were able to get an earlier check in as our flight landed much sooner than the normal check in time and I really appreciated that.
22418016,525040200,2019-09-07,52588232,Niko,amazing spot looks exactly the same as the pictures. super clean. and communication couldn’t be any better.

In der Umgebung sind genug Bar's in denen man abends lecker essen gehen kann. Auch zum frühstücken gibt es nette Cafés und auch eine Bäckerei gleich um die Ecke. Die Wohnung ist sehr gepflegt und modern ausgestattet, alles sehr sauber. Die Kommunikation mit Toni war super. Sehr empfehlenswert!"
22418016,527575586,2019-09-11,26065045,Cristina,"Toni’s apartment was great for our 2 night stay in Athens! Very clean and great connection with airport, port and city center, metro is only a 2 minute walk. We didn’t get to meet Toni as he was busy, but his friend gave us some great tips for doing around the city and we followed everything we could in our short stay. Would definitely stay there again if I ever return to Athens! "

22418016,539351342,2019-10-01,164988936,Jean-Claude,"The building looks a bit dodgy but is around a lot of restaurants and by the metro which is convenient- the elevator on the floor of the apt is missing a handle, the sofa wasn’t assembled properly (when you go sit you basically fall through) the host told us about having to turn the water heat on and off, when one’s on holiday who really wants to have to think of that? The walls weren’t cleaned and having white walls you’d think someone noticed that the ceiling in the main room looks like there’s some water damage and things like the curtains would come loose and the door handles and in the shower too all a bit wonky, the host was good at communication that’d I’d give him but there’s room for improvement for sure."

The owner has offered additional blankets in the closet, and that someone can look at the AC the next day. It was unacceptable, and luckily Airbnb agreed as we got a full refund after we left the apartment to find a hotel.<br/>The rest was ok. The apartment was clean and equipped with everything that was mentioned in the offer. The apartment owner responded very quickly to our messages."

This place is also in walking distance to the city center, Acropolis is just on the other side of filopappou hil and it's a pleasant walk to take.<br/>Even through we had not met in person Toni has been a great host. He answered really quickly, gave us all informations about the acommodation and helped us with everything we needed. Thank you! :)"
22418016,604452480,2020-02-11,144132992,Matyáš,"A great place to stay! It looks very new and modern and I'm really glad that we chose this place for our stay in Athens. I think it's a good value for the money, it's not far from the center (at least we walked everywhere), and there is a supermarket and restaurants right in front of it. There was no problem with communication and everything was to our liking. I would definitely recommend it."

22418016,613557013,2020-03-02,78789990,Denny,Toni's apartment is a great place. The descriptions and reviews are all to the point. No need to say that it was sparkling clean. Everything was comfortable and I was fascinated by the fact that it was so well-equipped. I even found needles and sewing threads to mend my dress. Excellent location with a super market opposite the apartment. Parking around was easier than we thought. I will definitely book next time I visit Athens.

22433351,250769404,2018-04-06,35277185,Ilva,"Una delle migliori esperienze avute con airbnb! L’appartamento è un sogno: ottimamente arredato, con una cucina spaziosa che al mattino si riempie di luce, due terrazze enormi e dalle quali si gode la vista sull’Acropoli, sul Philoppapou e in lontananza Licobetto. Tramonti romantici sui tetti di Atene, il quartiere Koukaki è davvero strategico: vicinissimo alle zone turistiche, eppure ancora autentico, con locali in cui mescolarvi con gente del posto, ottima cucina e prezzi ragionevoli. Supermercati vicinissimi, la zona è ben collegata con tutto il resto di Atene eppure l’appartamento è estremamente silenzioso. Siamo rimasti dodici giorni e abbiamo apprezzato sia la possibilità di muoversi per Atene, sia quella di lavorare in tranquillità a casa. Insomma, altamente consigliato!"

The note of the owner with details and suggestions about where to eat is really nice. The only thing is you don’t have contact with the owner of the apartment because the contact is through an agency. Response of the agency was perfect, most of all fast. But I miss to be in touch with the owner. But I guess it is a general change in Airbnb, because we have seen it a lot. The stay in this apartment was great, thank you"

The apartment was beautiful with everything you need, especially the Espressos in the morning! We honestly didn’t want to leave the apartment because the view was astounding. You can see everything! It was so romantic sitting on the terrace at night overlooking the Acropolis with lights galore. The bed was comfy, the AC was cold and we were sad to leave. We will definitely stay here anytime we come to Athens. The host had amazing communication with us throughout our journey. They offered many local tips and tricks. The area around the apartment was so much fun with all the nightlife only a block or two away. We hit up the bakery down the street and made friends with Angela there who offers up the most delicious treats. The restaurants the host suggested were phenomenal. We loved this place!!"

Private closed garage for your car (very useful when you know how parking is difficult to find in Athens). The view on philopappos hill and the parthenon from the terrasse and balcony is breathtaking.The appartement is at walking distance from everything you need to see (and eat) in this area.

He instantly solved all our problems, helped us and given a lot of advices about staying in Athens. The communication was great and very prompt in all aspects.<br/>We are very pleased with our stay, the flat was excellent, comfortable and clean. Very fast Wi-Fi, two clean bathrooms, new coffeemaker, all kitchen equipment. The apartment is spacious, comfy and cozy. We liked to do our breakfast on a nice balcony. There was an awesome, fantastic, spectacular vacation! Thanks for everything, Konstantinos! You're the super host!<br/><br/>Мы провели потрясающие каникулы в Афинах. Замечательная большая квартира, две спальни, милая гостиная с огромным телевизором, две ванные, уютный балкончик, на котором мы постоянно завтракали. В день нашего приезда Константинос принёс нам новый фен и новую кофемашину, это было очень приятно! Кухня оборудована всем необходимым, стиральная машина и посудомойка работали прекрасно, хорошая посуда, везде было очень чисто.<br/>Квартира находится на 4-ом этаже в тихом переулке, хороший подъезд, лифт, отличное расположение. Вай-фай работал бесперебойно, на хорошей скорости. <br/>Греки безумно гостеприимные и радушные! Мы в восторге от Афин и нашего пребывания в этих апартаментах.

And the best host, helpful and friendly, good and quick contact."
22440700,254246332,2018-04-16,29522989,Oleg,"Можно повною мірою рекомендувати апартаменти Константіноса. Важко до чогось придертися. Усе достатньо просто, але функційнально. Дві винних кімнати - це дуже зручно. Дещо галасно за вікном, але це проблема усього центру Афін. Разом із тим усі видатні місця можна достаться пішки. Є крамниці із продуктами поруч. Константінос дуже добре зустрів та відповів на усі питання. Кілька слів українською від нього були приємним додатком. Якщо хтось захоче поїхати на автівці у АФІНИ - залишайте автівку на платних стоянках - їх багато на центральних проспектах. Бо без болю дивитися на те, як паркується місцеві, не можна."

The place is clean and shine, with all the amenities you need and much more.

He provided a ride from the airport with a free comparable to a taxi, provided recommendations in the area, and was thoughtful and responsive with other requests (like information on the washing machine).

We really enjoyed staying at this place - it is a beautiful, clean and open flat with modernist character (charming staircase and marble floors). I didn't even read about Koukaki before, but it turned out to be the perfect neighborhood for our needs: many interesting restaurants (thanks for recommending Dio Dekares i Oka - wow!), citrus tree lined streets and close to Acropolis. We had a great short stay and we are coming back to explore Athens more, for sure!"

Λιγο φασαρια υπάρχει ιδιαίτερα τις βραδινές ώρες αλλα σε τέτοιο δρόμο πολυσύχναστο θα πρέπει κάποιος να το περιμένει. Θα το ξανά προτιμήσω.

Perfectly located with a few minutes walk to the Acropolis, restaurants and shops. Syntagma is about 10 minutes stroll and Monastiraki the same. The entrance to the Acropolis is at the end of the street! Plaka is lovely with shops, restaurants and amenities just a short walk. We did not even need to use the Metro! Thanks so much for a great stay :)"

Its perfect location offers proximity to all the historical sites but also to the vibrant nightlife of Athens without being in the middle of it. <br/>Konstantinos and the team were very pleasant to communicate with and facilitated our stay in the best possible way. <br/>I highly recommend his apartment for an inspiring visit of Athens!"
22443289,247646635,2018-03-29,89413374,Iva,"I am so happy I chose to stay in this apartment. Everything is just as beautiful in real life as in the photos. Acropolis was just around the corner just like Plaka - lovely neighbourhood full of restaurants and coffee shops. <br/>The place was crystal clean, bed was amazing, living room was great and the bathroom as well. It was quiet at night. I have nothing bad to say. I wish I could have stayed forever haha. Thank you so much to the staff who were always very quick to respond to any of our questions."

The apartment is in a very convenient location - we walked the entire city from there. The area is rather busy during the day but quiet at night. If you are not used to motorcycle/scooter noise, you may want to bring a pair of ear plugs though - a rather busy main road is only one block away. Communication with the host was excellent. Very responsive and helpful. Would stay here again anytime."
22443289,260805844,2018-05-05,26221682,Lisa,Great spot centrally located in Athens. Safe area and plenty of cafes and restaurants. The metro station is close by and you are in walking distance to the main tourist attractions. If you are new and would like a general overview of the area I would strongly suggest taking an ebike tour ( (Website hidden by Airbnb) which can also be booked by the hosts - the husband and wife duo Kostas and Sofia were absolutely wonderful and Andreas our tour guide and was great! Could not recommend them enough!
22443289,263071762,2018-05-11,43111185,Ollie,Beautiful apartment in probably the best location in all of Athens. Host was Very accommodating! We will definitely be back again soon
22443289,269209707,2018-05-27,18222151,Robert,Great location in a wonderful street. Close to a busy road so a bit noisy. We could have closed the Windows and put on aircon but it was not necessary as not so bad. 
22443289,271439499,2018-06-01,34791396,Jake,"Stylish and well kept apartment with a incredible location.  We had no problem walking to all the major sites around the Plaka and the rest of the central city.<br/><br/>We were also traveling with our 15-month old son, and the apartment was very baby safe and convenient, with enough space for him to run around without getting into any trouble, as well as quiet places for him to nap."

22443289,277967936,2018-06-17,21440434,Siddarth,"Combining the aspects of location , amenities and inclusions of the apartment itself , this apartment is truly excellent , majority of attractions( acropolis , plaka , hadrian's arc etc) are walking distance ( less than 20 minutes ) Acropoli metro station is 5 min walk away.  Fantastic restaurants are on the door step or a stone throw away. A number of walking tours actually start on the door step of the building which adds to the convenience factor. The apartment itself is very good , 24 hours of hot water , plenty of lighting , comfortable bed , sofa and the building itself is very secure with security. Further there is a pharmacy and mini market nearby for any urgent items.<br/><br/>If you are considering a few days in Athens, this apartment ticks all the boxes and then some."

22443289,326307691,2018-09-22,53875922,Peta,Amazing apartment in fantastic location . Next time we stay in Athens we will stay in one of these apartments. Konstantino’s team are very easy to deal with and very quick to respond to any questions. You are provided with constant communication and information. Apartment was fantastic and the location was superb. Do yourself a favour and stay here.
22443289,331345928,2018-10-02,129123672,Ron,"Wonderful apartment with good facilities (including washer /dryer), plenty of space, very comfortable bed, nicely decorated and fantastic location, very close to major tourist spots.

22443289,352951723,2018-11-26,7260494,Shai,"Apartment was clean and well organized exactly as described. Prime location very close to the Acropoli metro station so going out to explore Athens was easy. Service was responsive and fast - I asked for an extra blanket and it was delivered within 2 hours. Kitchen is small and not suitable for preparing big meals, but was OK for me. I would recommend this apartment and would stay here again."
22443289,355179210,2018-12-03,16104460,Kate,"I was a little anxious that this apartment would be sparsely furnished, but infact it’s very nice indeed, very welcoming, spacious and comfortable and with excellent quality bedding (so important) – I didn’t want to get up in the mornings! It’s also in a perfect location, with the most charming part of Athens on its doorstep and a lovely short walk to the small tavernas off Lisiou, for supper in the evening. There’s some traffic noise from the main road, a small block away, but it stops before midnight and didn’t disturb.<br/><br/>I must also mention the difference the agents, Upstreet, made to my visit -very professional indeed, always a fast response, welcoming and efficient - it always takes time to settle in and no agent could have done better, from the moment I booked. You have the complete sense they are “to hand” should you need them – rather as though your hand is being held along the way! I thoroughly recommend them to guests and property owners alike – as someone who comes to Athens once a year, I noticed it had a significant effect on the quality of my stay."
22443289,367136654,2019-01-04,130160367,Frédéric,"Idéalement placé, cet appartement est très propre et Konstantinos et son équipe sont très réactifs pour toutes demandes."
22443289,368574578,2019-01-07,66482122,Lydia,"In short: don't think twice about booking this place!!  The apartment is beautiful, exactly as shown in the pictures, very clean, very stylish, and with many amenities included.  Everything you may need is provided and if anything more is needed, I am sure Konstantinos and his team will help you with that too!  Konstantinos is very prompt at replying and extremely helpful.  You are provided with tips about the city and one of the best features of the apartment is its location: right at the historic city center.  Exiting the apartment to be in one of the central streets of Athens with views of the Acropolis is truly something that makes a difference!  Check-in is also very easy and the Upstreet team regularly checks with you if everything is going well with your stay.  Overall, one of the best Airbnb experiences we have had!! Thank you very much!"
22443289,400487596,2019-01-12,131271902,Clara,"Le séjour à Athènes s'est très bien passé. L'entrée dans l'appartement a été simple et rapide. Le logement est propre, très bien décoré et lumineux. Il est aussi idéalement situé, à quelques mètres de l'Acropole, de la Plaka, de l'arrêt de métro."
22443289,405454280,2019-01-27,192947467,Lisa,The perfect apartment!! We have stayed in Athens before and by far this has been the best located apartment in Athens. It is so close to the metro so getting everywhere in Athens is easy from here. The apartment was spotlessly clean with all of the little touches needed to get your stay started. Super comfy big bed with lovely linen and towels. The hosts are always checking in to make sure everything is ok. The instructions on how to get to the apartment and how things works were very clear and detailed. I highly recommend staying here
22443289,407496124,2019-02-02,28438329,Melanie,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights in late Jan 2019. The communication with the host’s company, Upstreet, was always smooth, quick and polite. The instructions for arrival from the airport and to check in were superb, and made it very easy for us. The apartment is clean and comfortable with good wifi and a Netflix subscription. There is also a lift, as well as stairs, in the building which makes accessing the apartment easy. It’s very centrally located close to the Acropolis Museum, Acropolis south entrance, Plaka, Hadrian’s Arch, Temple of Zeus and on and on - it’s a perfect spot from which to walk to many of the main attractions in Athens. It’s also close to a metro - Acropoli - which makes airport transfers simple. The host very kindly let us have a late check out at late notice so we could enjoy our last day in Athens without having to take our luggage around with us. Nothing was too hard for them and they were very hospitable and kind. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone staying in Athens."
22443289,410012430,2019-02-09,24778842,Esma,"Very comfortable apartment, super centrally located!  I really enjoyed the small balcony, with a view of Lycabettus Hill!  The flat is very close to a main road, Vasilisis Amalias, but very quiet when the shutters are closed.   Just book it, it is GREAT!"
22443289,417131113,2019-02-26,36833913,Josh,"The place is excellent! Its exactly as described. The apartment is clean and new. The team is very much engaged on making your stay wonderful, checking on you once in a while, making sure everything is alright. Everything is walking distance from the apartment. The flea market is around 15min walk. The temple of zeus is literally on the other side of the road.  The parthenon is very close as well. There are a lot of good and affordable sit down and take away food around the area - no excuse not to get good greek food! Overall a five star location!"

22443289,424797129,2019-03-17,212940386,Deepti,"A cozy apartment in heart of Plaka, walking distance to all major attractions and unique shopping experience. The interiors is tastefully done. Great support from host and his team in fulfilling all the necessary obligations. The only  improvement that we can see is providing enough toiletries based on number of ppl and nights spent in the apartment."

22443289,441532348,2019-04-22,160179154,Ruowei,"Highly recommended. Location can’t be better. The neighborhood is safe and vibrant, with 2 minutes walking to everything: Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, Olympieio, metro as well as a supermarket. The apartment itself is clean and well-decorated with a spacious balcony. Self check in and out procedures are so flexible. Upstreet team responded to our questions very quickly and gave us every information in detail. I would like to stay in their apartments next time."

22443289,465055137,2019-06-07,19394422,Guia,"The apartment is situated at the end of the main road leading towards the Acropolis entrance.  The Acropolis museum as well as the metro is a short walk.  Lots of cafes and restaurants as soon as you stepped out of the building.  Beautiful place - it is clean, modern, and very spacious."
22443289,481560760,2019-07-05,19979859,Victoria,"Loved this apartment! The apartment itself is perfect for a couple, or a couple with 2 kids (as we were). It is clean, stylish, nice touches and decor, and super comfortable after a long hot day wandering Athens. The location is outstanding: right by all the ancient sights (acropolis, acropolis museum, temple of zeus etc) as well as the best shopping and restaurant streets in Athens. We especially loved this location as it allowed us to easily pop back to the apartment to cool down and take a rest before moving on to the next ruins! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend and would definitely stay here again. Also, communication with host was fantastic. Thanks for a great stay!!"
22443289,483975469,2019-07-08,268878403,Yadira,"This apartment is in a great location. Many points of interest are within walking distance.  There’s accesible transportation within reach. The apartment is cozy, clean and chic. There are many restaurants on the same street that were great! There’s a yogurt bar and ice cream place downstairs where the owners are super nice which my daughter really enjoyed. My husband and I would stay here again if we ever come back to Athens. Thank you Kostas and your team for being so attentive! <br/>All the best,<br/>The Peñate Family!"

22443289,509349465,2019-08-14,148441913,Jenny,"This place was a haven from tourist valley.  Plaka was a fabulous place to stay and the property was SO central to all the great things to see in Athens.  It was spotlessly clean, comfortable and easy to get to.  We were just so thrilled when we walked through the door that it had everything we needed and was so organized.  You wont regret staying at this oasis."
22443289,511316542,2019-08-17,31027946,Jay,"If you come to Athens, stay here. It’s close to all archeological sites and the Plaka. You can walk everywhere. It was great having AC. Can be a little loud at night with the cars driving by but it didn’t bother us."
22443289,524031492,2019-09-05,31324762,Frank & Claudia,This place was honestly the best location for any tourist! I have lived in Athens and can honestly say that this felt like a Manhattan apartment in Athens. Great location and very clean. Thanks guys!
22443289,525152319,2019-09-07,73608370,Nicolette,"The space is beautiful. Hands down the best place to stay in Athens. It is  so conveniently located and the space is stylish and clean, I loved it! I will definitely be booking with them for my next Greece trip, thank you guys!"

Stylish, pristine clean, and was equipped with all the amenities we needed for our stay (washing machine, iron board, kitchenware, coffee & tea, Netflix, fresh clean towels, toiletries..). Location is great and most importantly felt safe. It’s walking distance to all the main attractions in Athens and has plenty of restaurants & cafes nearby. Fast response from the host too."
22443289,533910755,2019-09-22,20388486,Pearlyna,"I had to book the apartment last minute due to missing one night of stay at a hotel, and the host team was great at responding to my request and confirming my arrival :) The apartment is beautiful, and had every amenity you would need and use in a home. The surrounding area is very convenient for tourists - we were able to walk to great restaurants, shops, and sight see. I highly recommend this apartment, and would come back"
22443289,536569385,2019-09-27,85937913,Mary,"What an incredible place, comfortable, very spacious and the location could not be better!"
22443289,538696649,2019-09-30,62313540,Sherilyn,This place is literally in the perfect location! One minute away from the metro - and steps away from multiple hop on/hop off bus stops and tour meeting points! We took two organized tours during our stay and they both met within 5 minutes of the apartment which was amazingly convenient. <br/><br/>We loved walking the shop lined streets to get to bars and restaurants in Plaka and Monastiraki every night! <br/><br/>The washer/dryer combo was useful and we were thankful for the powerful A/C unit - great stay all around.
22443289,543727296,2019-10-08,80363958,Patrice,"Our stay at this property was awesome. The location of this property is right in the heart of Plaka and was walking distance to everything that we wanted to see/do. The apartment itself was large, clean and had great amenities, with constant, strong WiFi, Netflix and even a washing machine! Communication with the team at Upstreet was really good, they even notified me to inform me of strikes that were taking place during my stay in Athens. Touches like this made our stay really special. Thank you for everything."
22443289,545418612,2019-10-12,177964222,Valerija,"Apartment overall was very good, clean, stocked with all necessities and in a secured apartment block.  Excellent location to the Acropolis and other attractions.  A few minutes walk to the Metro station and other public transport.  Very good restaurants and shopping all within easy walking distances. Highly recommended."
22443289,547414402,2019-10-15,16678319,Anna,"Thank you very much for hosting us in your nice apartment! We really enjoyed our stay in Athens! The apartment is perfectly located for visiting the historical sites and amble through the beautiful Plaka and Anafiotika quarter with its nice coffees, bars and restaurants."
22443289,553015568,2019-10-23,535995,Debbie,"Great location in a pedestrian mall, close to all the sights & a short walk with bags from the metro. It was only €10 one way to the airport by metro which was much cheaper than a taxi. The airport service runs half hourly & the local station has escalators to get your bags down to the station. Plaka is a very touristy area which meant it was difficult to get a quality meal but do your research and get a few blocks away to find small wine bars & eateries with better meals. It was surprisingly quiet at night considering you’re right in the middle of the city. If you’re used to rural quiet note this secure apartment is near a busy street so there’s a regular traffic buzz in the background but not enough to stop us going back. Check with the host about building noise - there was construction work immediately next door on our last day."
22443289,561842863,2019-11-10,42490391,Jimmy,"It was a good stay, very convenient to visit around acropolis. Safe place to stay."

22443289,566694287,2019-11-20,55695505,Deborah,"Wonderfully close to so many things including restaurants, bars, shops and sights around Athens. Really a feel of home and nice touches throughout. The host does a great job of telling you about sights, restaurants, things to do and helpful hints."
22443289,576381402,2019-12-13,157544815,Tanya,"Great location! The apartment was clean and very spacy and comfortable, especially for family with little baby."
22443289,597695817,2020-01-26,144483506,Tiffany,"The location is AMAZING!! You really can’t get a better location, close to Acropolis, food, stores, etc. The bed was comfortable and the apartment was clean. Upstreet did a good job with communication, the check in process was a bit difficult because I didn’t have service to get the upload they sent me, so finding the exact place and apartment was kind of a struggle... but they responded in a timely manor! First time in Greece and so happy we chose this place!"
22443289,603468564,2020-02-09,235945565,Alexandria,"My boyfriend and I booked a last minute to trip to Athens from Tel Aviv and were desperately trying to secure our lodging the night before we left .  I explained the situation to UPSTREET and they responded instantly and even allowed us an early check in since our flight was arriving first thing the next morning.<br/><br/>The apartment is self is HUGE compared to most European standards and it looks exactly like the pictures.  We really appreciated the (2) heaters in both the living room and bedroom- which is a rare find.  UPSTREET provided all the needed necessities and more...even a list of sites and attractions to see near by.<br/><br/>Lastly, you can’t be this location!! You are literally next to everything, the Acropolis Museum is like 2 blocks away... Temple of Zeus, and tons of shopping and restaurants to choose from!<br/><br/>I highly recommend this property- Location, Customer Service and overall Hospitality receive 10’s across the board!"
22443289,607071350,2020-02-17,128148714,Mary,"Great place. Clean, convenient, and location is great. Check-in was a breeze, and so was check-out.  Would stay here again and recommend."

22443289,616607352,2020-03-10,44361855,Chloe,"Perfect location, right next to the Acropolis and a 1 minute walk to the metro which is super easy to use and get around! <br/><br/>My partner and I actually travelled to Athens to have fertility treatment and this apartment was perfect for chilling out in between clinic appointments. We had Netflix and Amazon prime, a great TV, WiFi was good for us to do some work and the bed was super comfy! We cooked quite a bit and had all the stuff we needed! <br/><br/>We also managed to look around and had some lovely meals close by particularly at Yard restaurant and bar, delicious! <br/><br/>When we travelled over in January we stayed in Monastiraki which we didn’t love and so we were apprehensive about coming back but this area was much nicer, quieter (but not too quiet) and lovely little streets and shops to roam around. <br/><br/>Upstreet were fantastic and replied almost immediately to any queries we had. It was definitely a home from home and we would certainly stay here again."
22443289,619990607,2020-03-20,71898587,Marcus,"This is an exceptional property. Not only is it in a great position opposite the Temple of Olympian Zeus, but it comes with just about every amenity - washing machine, Netflix, etc. Although I've been to Athens several times before, I can't imagine staying anywhere else in the future."
22443289,634478927,2020-07-04,27790526,Andrea,Location is perfect and apartment is bright and spacious for a couple. We truly enjoyed our stay
22443289,644937016,2020-08-01,60350546,Steve,I couldn't have been happier with the apartment or the level of care provided by Upstreet.  Would stay again.

The apartment is very comfortable and well equipped, and makes for a perfect base for a single traveller or a couple visiting central Athens. Communication with the Upstreet team was always clear, courteous and prompt. I would recommend the apartment without hesitation."

Everything you want to see is walkable including tourist sites and approximately infinity excellent restaurants. And the rest is metro-able from stations less than 2 blocks away. As for the flat itself, it’s spacious and modern. Fluffy white bed. Comfortable furniture. WiFi a bit slow - Netflix TV just kept spinning. But 10 minute walk to Cosmote store where you can get unlimited SIM data for 30 days for 24 euro - we were able to work off of that all week. We let the owner know so hopefully they will fix that!"

We tried to call Alexi, but the phone number from Airbnb didn’t work.<br/>The floor wasn’t clean and there was very little soap, toilet paper and the sheets had strange spots.<br/>The cleaning lady had an extra key and came after a few days to the apartment, just to pick something up, which we found really strange. (We weren’t at home, Alexi just messaged me).<br/>When we checked out, the cleaning Lady came at 7.15 in the morning, even though I told Alexi, we would leave around 7.30.<br/>So it was a really unpleasant ending."

The apartment has 2 big balconies (i didn't see the photos of the second that was a very good surprise ) that offers you relaxing time. Nice and quite neighborhood and but at the same time so close to the City Seeing. You can go by car, train, bus in a few minutes. Even by walk. <br/>Highly recommended to anyone who wants to reach a 5 star accommodation.<br/>The best place i have staying so far. <br/>Thanks a lot."

We didn't find it the first Saturday we were there, but there is a great farmers' market three or four blocks away. We recommend using the Beat application for getting taxis. I've stayed in other AirBnB units in the past couple of years, and this unit was the best. Oh, and if you are an English speaker, it is very good to have hosts that speak the language."

As city centre is not far we walked everywhere hence got a good  sense of local life. Speaking of local life, we were right in the midst of it all. From the balcony, we witnessed everyday life of our area, watched people walking by. I am most grateful for this. We did not feel like tourists at all.<br/><br/>Sofia and George was lovely hosts from the beginning to the end. They gave us recommendations, arranged a cab with an english speaking driver to take us back to the airport  early a.m. I would highly recommend this property to everyone visiting wonderful Athens."

The lack of washing machine was an issue, but fortunately found a wash&dry nearby. It would be nice to rennovate the bathroom a bit and also add a linen changing service for longer stays. Totally worth it for a shorter stay though."

Right from the beginning she was welcoming, incredibly helpful and communicated all the details very clearly.  I felt at home immediately!<br/><br/>The apartment is a dream...right on Fokionos Negri with all of its cafes, bars and shops, yet set back enough so that you have space, light and quiet whenever you want it. The inside is beautifully decorated in neutral colours and features some stunning original Greek architectural touches and furniture.  Just perfect for a short stay. <br/><br/>Plenty of towels and little touches like coffee and tea etc made my stay even more wonderful.

22478850,256907500,2018-04-24,67226519,Lise,"Dejlig lys lejlighed, der har alt, man skal bruge på en ferie. Vi lavede morgenmad  i lejligheden, som vi spiste på altanen. Lejligheden vender ud mod en hyggelig plads, hvor der altid var noget at kigge på. Desuden var der fyldt med restauranter og cafeer rundt om pladsen, så det er nemt at finde spisemuligheder i området. Lejligheden lå lidt udenfor centrum, dog med gode muligheder for offentlig transport lige rundt om hjørnet, hvis man ikke har mod på at gå ind til centrum. En taxi hjem fra centrum koster 6-7 euro. Det var virkelig en dejlig beliggenhed og mulighed for at komme lidt udenfor det meget turistede centrum af Athen. Længere nede af gaden kommer man til en bred gade fyldt med butikker, som går hele vejen ind til byen."

She is a gracious and friendly host, offering tips, helpful with anything we needed, etc.  Her place is quaint but bright and happy and was the perfect place for us.  The park running the length and center of her street teems with authentic Greek life and we LOVED it.  Tons and tons of restaurants!  We mostly took taxis because we wanted quick and easy transportation.  It was convenient to catch a cab right around the corner and it was usually about six euros to get anywhere we wanted to Center Athens for all the sightseeing we did record it is.  Would recommend this place to anyone for economical and authentic visit to Athens."

If I ever come to Athens again, I would definitely stay at Sofia's place. 10/10 recommended!"

The street where the flat is situated has lots of cafes and restaurants and no cars - it has a very good atmosphere! The bedroom is to the back so that this is very quiet. There is a second room with a sleepingsofa where a third person can sleep and that was very comfortable.
