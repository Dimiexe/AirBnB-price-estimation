The apartment was cosy and unique and super clean. Only minus was that there were no air conditioning - just a fan. But over all I can easily recommend the place!"
13790157,475899794,2019-06-25,28514800,Olivera,"I had a very nice stay at Nora & Anastasia's apartment in cental Athens. Nora was very friendly, also supportive in giving me directions on how to best reach the sights, shops or the metro station. Thank you for having me! Olivera "

It was an amazing stay, the flat is very well decorated and it really feels like home! Anastasia also sent us a lot of amazing adresses to test and all of them were fabulous! It was like living as an Athenian for a couple of days! I highly recommend!"
13790157,503639594,2019-08-06,218940,Andrew,"Nora’s place was the perfect spot to spend two wonderful nights in Athens. Communication was always swift and super helpful.<br/>Nora gave us some brilliant tips for eating and exploring this vibrant city. <br/>Exarchia is a brilliant part of Athens, and Nora’s house is quietly situated in one of the leafy side streets.<br/>Accommodation is homely and comfortable, and the beautiful shaded herb garden is a wonderful place to sit and have a lazy breakfast. Thank you Nora, we hope to stay again soon :)"
13790157,509255613,2019-08-14,19926509,Clio,"Anastasia and Nora’s home is beautiful and calm, with a garden full of rosemary and shade. Nora is an attentive, kind, and knowledgeable host. We highly recommend staying here! It was a highlight of our trip."
13790157,511361645,2019-08-17,13146589,Florian,"A great, personal and authentic place to stay with a lovely garden including even a fig tree! Highly recommended if you are keen to explore Exarchia instead of following the main sights only."
13790157,520296287,2019-08-30,13776858,Leticia,"Nora's place is a beautiful little oasis in the middle of a vibrant area in the center of Athens. You can disconnect from everything in the beautiful open spaces, filled with plants and beautiful details. And then, a couple of blocks away you can find restaurants, bars and a very authentic neighbourhood. If I happen to go back to Athens, I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Nora for the hospitality and all the recommendations."
13790157,524464939,2019-09-06,64210861,Miriam,We enjoyed our stay in Nora’s and Anastasia’s cozy little apartment very much. We didn’t have the pleasure to meet Anastasia but Nora was a very considerate and helpful hostess. The conditions in the apartment were very good and thanks to its location it was very cool and quiet. Our favourite part was the fact that the apartment is right next to the very interesting and exciting quarter Exarchia and also really close to the centre. Definitely recommend and will be happy to visit Anastasia and Nora again!
13790157,527938325,2019-09-12,8248389,Anne,We wisten niet wat we van Athene konden verwachten. Maar het was een zeer positieve ervaring! Mede door de heerlijke plek van Nora. Wat een rust middenin de drukte van Athene. Het tuintje is heerlijk met een kopje koffie in de ochtend. Natuurlijk was het voor ons compleet met de lieve honden en kat van Nora. Maar die zijn netjes opgevoed dus komen niet in het appartement. Alles was een stuk ruimer dan ik had verwacht! Het is wel een klim naar t huis toe. Maar zoveel fijne eettentjes en cafe’s in de buurt. Je hoeft eigenlijk niet ver te gaan om al van het heerlijke stadsleven te genieten. :). Een fijne plek en een mooie ervaring in Athene.
13790157,530677680,2019-09-16,194199,Doron,"Beautiful small apt that feels like a home, so rare on Airbnb. Pleasant flagstone yard with a fig tree, olive, rosmary & thyme. Books and paintings line the walls, the latter mostly the work of the talented Anastasia. The location is convenient, 15-20 mins by metro from center, Acropolis, etc. 5 mins walk to the National Archeological Museum. Market, bakery down the road."
13790157,543144736,2019-10-07,211782652,Ola,"We enjoyed staying in the apartment, Anastasia and Nora they were very helpful and welcoming. the place was clean and easy to move in it. Lovely living room with interesting art and books. The garden is a lovely spot specially with the morning coffee and the pets. ;)<br/>The location end up ideal to walk to the center of the city and discover some other parts of the city on the way as well.<br/>Thank you for having us and make us feel home. <br/><br/>Ola&Niall"
13790157,547437094,2019-10-15,4305796,Tanya,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay with Nora and Anastasia.  For us this is exactly what an airbnb experience should be like.  We were instantly made to feel at home, and are really happy we had some time to chat with Anastasia and Nora.  The apartment has everything you need, and we really appreciated being able to go back there to relax after a lot of sightseeing.  <br/>For us it was a great location.  Not in the busy historical, touristic centre, but not too far away either.  Easy to get into town by walking, metro or taxi.  Nora gave us soooo many helpful tips, about sights, cafes, restaurants and so much more.  We would definitely stay here again if we visit Athens.  And we will also definitely stay in touch, thank you Nora and Anastasia!!"

13790157,556641209,2019-10-30,105372642,Haley,This place is lovely. It is a good deal and close enough to to the subway lines. It is nice to stay out of the super touristy areas.  This neighborhood is a bit rough around the edges but it has some hidden gems in restaurants and bars.
13790157,558693561,2019-11-03,1326545,Wendy,"Lovely, comfortable space in a lively neighborhood with great restaurants, cafes, etc. Will definitely return to this cozy pad."
13790157,563249122,2019-11-12,105332734,Aleksandr,"Nora is an amazing host! Apartments located in a nice district. There are a lot of cafes and bars, easy to get to the city center within walking distance (about 15-20min). The bus stop and metro station are also near the place. <br/>Nora gave a huge tutorial about interesting places in Athens and she always was online and helped us with any questions.<br/>Totally recommend!"
13790157,565985485,2019-11-18,10094124,Iyade,"Nora and Anastasia are very hospitable, and kind and did everything so that the stay would be nice. Nice Appartment, comfortable and well decorated."

The house itself is so charming, clean and comfortable. Beautiful art, the tiled floors are to die for and the patio in the back is tranquillity at its finest. I can not recommend this air bnb enough. Probably the most interesting, kind and generous host I have ever had. Thank you. I will be back!"
13790157,634142629,2020-07-03,35605644,Vanessea,"Nora and Anatasia’s hospitality was exceptional. From helping me order pizza delivery to inviting me to one of the most lively Saturday markets in Athens (which is just a few steps from the house), they really went out of their way to make my stay as nice as possible. The house itself was stylishly decorated and located in the best area in Exarcheia, a quiet side street halfway up a hill. Really appreciated the presence of the animals as well !"
13790157,644939136,2020-08-01,586773,Enno,Great from A-Z!
13790157,646902828,2020-08-05,25105987,Farah,"The appartement is really well located in Exarcheia . Quiet, very clean and the paintings makes it lovely . We had a warm welcome from Anastasia and Nora and we felt like we are home . We also enjoyed the terrasse where despite the hot temperatures during the summer there were always some fresh air there . I’ll come back there with no hesitation ."
13790157,647658514,2020-08-07,14475995,Carole,"The house is really as described. Nicely decorated, very quiet, the garden is really a plus, especially in summer. It is a nice contrast with the very centre of Athens. <br/>We spent only 2 nights but felt like at home. <br/>Nora is a nice girl, easy to communicate with. <br/>We will definitely recommend her house! <br/>Thank you Nora :)"
13790157,647947746,2020-08-08,31667304,Luzie,"This is a lovely little apartment in a really great location in central Athens. We only stayed one night but our host gave us so many helpful tips for what to do in Athens. Very cozy, comfortable apartment."
13790157,650419244,2020-08-13,13255376,Daniel,"Anastasia and her place were just perfect. We felt at home from the get-go, and her amazingly elaborate recommendations had us living like locals in no time (or trying to anyway!)."

13790157,659835930,2020-09-03,18201462,Flavie,"A beautiful house and adorable guests that will leave you a memorable experience in Athens. Located in the lovely yet leafy part of Exarchia, you’ll be able to discover the not so touristy part of town waking up in a quiet retreat. <br/>The very nicely decorated and well-equipped house is located up a steep hill for maximum quietness and a unique charm but be ready to travel lighter than us. Very recommended listing all in all with friendly furry friends if you love pets ☺️."
13790157,661384471,2020-09-07,86024649,Leonie,"It’s a place that almost feels like home after an exhausting day in the city - <br/>quiet, comfortable and cool. Stylish apartment with history in a vibrant area. Very well located. The terrace with the sweet dogs is definitely a plus! You might think of Ohropax because the fridge (and sometimes the barking) is a little noisy - but nothing to worry about. We loved our stay at Nora‘s & Anastasia‘s!"
13790157,662275218,2020-09-09,1988120,Sheila,"Great area to stay, local restaurants near - vintage stores. Nora have us perfect tips for our stay. And of course her appartement is one of a kind!"

13790157,667409394,2020-09-24,20002645,Tess,Such a great place located in a very nice area of Athens. Close to many nice restaurants and cafes. The apartment was very cute and clean and the little outside garden made the place very special. Recommend this place to everyone that’s interested in something unique.

13790157,673707617,2020-10-12,178310032,Nora,"We really enjoyed our 3-day stay in Athens. The interior of the apartment is lovely, the terrace great and there are lots of things to do in the neighbourhood. If I had stayed longer I might have found the apartment a bit dark, but nothing to worry about, especially not in summer when you spend all your time outside anyways. Nora was extremely friendly and gave us lots of tips. I would definitely come again!"
13790157,700369137,2020-10-14,73825562,Leonidas,"Homely and stylish, in a perfect location!"
13790157,704128815,2020-10-26,12525628,Niclas,"Perhaps the most beautiful Airbnb I've ever had the pleasure to stay in. Despite Athens being a real treat, it's been even more enjoyable waking up in and returning to this wonderful space after a long day of exploring the city. Thanks a lot for having me, and hopefully see you again rather sooner than later!"
13790157,404840273379346570,2021-07-12,38908321,Elsa,"nora and her family are very caring and welcoming hosts.  the apartment is located in a very nice area where nora introduced us to excellent addresses.  the garden, which we were able to occupy without problem, is a real plus.  dogs too!  the apartment is tastefully decorated and there are lots of very nice little touches (mosquito repellants, kitchen products, etc.).  we felt like at home!"
13790157,406192082880024732,2021-07-14,24876322,David,"Anastasia was a terrific host — communcative, friendly, informative, easy — and the house is really special, nestled into a beautiful corner of Exarcheia. I cannot recommend highly enough for your stay in Athens."
13790157,417826972797816831,2021-07-30,4631633,Samuel,"We had the most wonderful time in the flat of Nora and her mother, Anastasia. They were very welcoming, as was the flat we rented. Filled with the sensitive paintings of Anastasia, and situated at a few steps of the natural park Lofos Strefi, this place is a true oasis for writers or artists that like to spend some time downtown Athens. The Exarchia neighbourhood is safe, filled with cafés and restaurants, has an open air cinema and some secondhand clothing shops close by. The garden at the back of the house is a great feat with a fig tree (July) and pomegranate (late August). We're hope to come back in the near future!"
13790157,419318818952625995,2021-08-01,1564111,Madeline,"One of my favorite places I’ve ever stayed. Anastasia and Nora were so welcoming and kind, and the apartment is absolutely beautiful. The location is also perfect - close enough to the center of the city to walk to all the sights but out of the way enough to feel more local. I wish I could have stayed longer. Thank you Nora and Anastasia for all your help and hospitality!!!"
13790157,425098854368773911,2021-08-09,216543679,Daniel,The flat is wonderful. I highly recommend it!
13790157,426579518515824289,2021-08-11,80900622,Christoffer,"We had the most lovely stay at Anastasia’s beautiful house, the garden alone is a visit worth and just a cute space to unwind after a long day around Athens, grab a beer and if you’re lucky a talk with her very artistic and talented mother. <br/>The space all together has everything you need, and is nicely decorated and it’s clean down to the last corner. <br/>5/5"
13790157,428662324808653532,2021-08-14,198254687,David,The apartment is lovely with a cute garden for morning coffee :) and the communication with Anastasia was very easy. Would definitely recommend for a stay!

13790157,439557090954012118,2021-08-29,54067886,Tamara,Great location and helpful host! Very nice staying in the house. I would just advice to take some earplugs if you are sound sensitive : the surroundings are quiet but not the fridge in the kitchen next to the room :)
13790157,446766574483744937,2021-09-08,4735738,Ivan,"Fantastic location, the best host. <br/><br/>Nora provided us with a bunch of local places to check out and was extremely accommodating and responsive yet giving us space for ourselves. <br/><br/>The place feels authentic and not cheesy/touristy. Also there’s a dog to greet you when you come back home, so that’s always a plus :)"
13790157,448284814411942659,2021-09-10,352684612,Άννα,"The best airbnb experience that we could have asked for! The house was beautiful, really cozy and we immediately felt like home. Anastasia and Nora were very welcoming and warm. The location is perfect and very near to the city center with a very lovely neighborhood full of cats and trees.

The apartment was spotless, trendy, chic and located in the historic Plaka district, minutes away from Acropolis and a multitude of wonderful restaurants. 
<br/>I would recommend this apartment highly and Pantelis was extremely helpful when it came to what to see and where to go. Don't hesitate to ask him anything! A+++"
13812118,85612818,2016-07-12,1198765,Josep,"The apartment is just as described, very nice, clean and organized. The location is perfect to visit the center of Athens, very near to the Acropolis and in a very beautiful and centric neighbourhood. Pantelis was very kind, a great host and helped us with everything we needed. If we go back to Athens we will definitely repeat at his apartment."
13812118,87004585,2016-07-18,31139985,Sina,"No words needed <br/><br/>Best Location: quite street, but in middle of all important sights, restaurants and the shopping street,  - Best Connection: in the middle of three central metro stations  (Syntagma, Monastiraki, Acropoli), access to all lines and tram - Really nice apartment: new, clean and bigger than any hotel you can find - Really nice host as well: thanks again to Pantelis for the<br/>provided household and bathroom stuff<br/>and especially a big thanks for the surprise present, a melon!<br/><br/>Sure, we would like to return someday!"
13812118,87640123,2016-07-21,3786521,Lucia,"Un'esperienza meravigliosa! La casa è bellissima, ristrutturata con molto gusto. Tutto è nuovissimo e funzionante, compresi i condizionatori silenziosissimi! La posizione è perfetta, perché è in pieno centro ma in una stradina non rumorosa. Pantelis, il padrone di casa, ha un negozio sotto l'appartamento ed è molto cordiale e disponibile! Lo consiglio al 100%!!"
13812118,90119385,2016-07-31,67140359,Walid,"As a family we really enjoyed our stay in Pantelis’s place.
<br/>The location of the apartment is really comfortable right in the middle of the down-town of the city close to the bazar and to the roads that lead to the famous Acropolis. 
<br/>A very modern apartment with modern and comfortable furniture and a good climatisation.
<br/>
<br/>We should also note that the owner was very honest and helpful as well as generous keeping us some tasty snacks and food for Breakfast. 
<br/>
<br/>We recommend this place for every couple or family that want to spend a comfortable and relaxing time in Athens."
13812118,90969280,2016-08-03,50859472,Sanja,"This place was great, host was responding regularly and his assistant helped us settle down. He was very nice and helpful. Everything is as it shows on the pictures, nice, modern, clean. Location is amazing, close to everything. Highly recommend this place. Two small things to mention- i brought to owners attention that while taking shower water was coming out from drain on the floor and flooding the bathroom, it was not easy taking shower. Second thing as you dont need car for this apartment if you have it you can park 1 km away where it is free in front of the buildings instead of 20EUR by this place. "
13812118,91304970,2016-08-04,83028405,Tanja,"Our trip to Athens was a very short but pleasant one. Pantelis' apartment was very central and perfect for our short stay in Athens.

Cozy and comfortable with great AC, fluff and fold down the street, grocery four blocks away, on a quite street very near the Cathedral.  The host Pantelis was so perfect with meeting us and giving us information about the area.  The apartment is newly renovated and is exactly as shown (maybe even better in person)!

<br/>The Location was Perfect!!! quiet yet close to everything. It was one street away from Adreanou.  close to syntagma square,and monasteriki. Its at Plaka Area but on a quiet street. Everything was walkable, Acropolis, Acorpolis Museum , restaurants, Shopping etc...

It has been recently renovated and looks amazing.  The apartment is so comfortable and so close to everything you would need.  We only wish our stay wasn't so short.  I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Athens.

The apartment was clean and the host helpful. He provided breakfast essentials (juice, water, tea, jams, bread, etc) which was a nice touch. Would highly recommend! "
13812118,100805774,2016-09-11,3049171,Alice,"L'appartement est parfait : propre, joli, fonctionnel et très bien placé ! Super rapport qualité prix !"
13812118,101397048,2016-09-13,93616531,Christian,Had a great time and Pantelis was very helpful giving city tips and even providing some food and tea. 
13812118,101466048,2016-09-13,6615154,Sonia,"Pantelis' place was fantastic! It's right in the quaint Plaka district beneath the Parthenon. Pantelis was very friendly and welcoming - he met us nearby even though it was late, and made sure we were comfortable. He was also kind enough to leave us water, juice, some breakfast cake, coffee, tea and even a couple of beers! 
<br/>
<br/>The flat is lovely and is stylishly furnished. A lot of thought and care has gone into it, from the spectacular shower to the comfy bed, great pillows and fluffy white towels to the high-quality hair dryer and AC. There's a big flat screen TV in case you're keen to relax in the flat, plus a charming little Juliet balcony decorated with little olive trees. You couldn't ask for anything more! 
<br/>
<br/>The neighbourhood is great - it feels very safe and all sorts of delightful restaurants are just a few steps away. 
<br/>
<br/>In short, it's a wonderfully decorated and comfortable new flat in a prime location and a good price. We would recommend Pantelis' place wholeheartedly!"
13812118,102203398,2016-09-17,55782790,Jérôme,"Tout d'abord des indications précises données par notre hôte nous ont permis de trouver le point de rendez-vous  facilement, puis un accueil ponctuel et chaleureux nous a été réservé. 
<br/>L'appartement est en tout point similaire aux photos, et surtout très bien placé (commerces, restaurant et Metro à proximité), à distance à pied de l'acropole. Il est également très propre. 
<br/>Notre hôte nous a conseillé des adresses, et est resté disponible durant tout le séjour en cas de besoin. 
<br/>Bref, un point de chute idéal pour un couple qui souhaite passer quelques jours Athènes. Nous le recommandons!!"
13812118,102377467,2016-09-18,18085363,Morgan,"Panthelos was extremely responsive in texts, held our luggage for us when we arrived early before check-in, gave us lunch recommendations and walking directions, arranged transportation to/from the port and more. He also left a bottle of wine and snacks in the apartment for us! 
<br/>
<br/>The apt itself is in a GREAT location. 10 min walk from the Acropolis, near all great shopping, restaurants, bars. Looks exactly as pictured in the photos. 
<br/>
<br/>Definitely a great value, accommodating host, and would recommend!"
13812118,103028387,2016-09-20,21688283,Raquel,"El apartamento está genial, tal y como aparece en las fotos. Está muy céntrico, al lado de la catedral, lo que hace que se pueda ir andando a cualquier barrio. Pantelis es muy simpático y nos ayudó en cualquier duda que tuviéramos, además llegamos antes del check in y nos guardo las maletas mientras esperábamos a que estuviera listo el apartamento. Muy recomendable, para repetir."
13812118,103784981,2016-09-24,22694841,Peter,The position of the apartment was perfect for visiting the Plaka and ancient sites. The apartment was extremely well organised. Pantelis was a gracious host and I recommend saying at his place .

13812118,105245025,2016-10-01,15762119,Sia,Pantelis was very communicative and helpful. He made us feel very welcome and brought along a friend who explained to us about things to do in Athens. We enjoyed our stay at Pantelis's place in Athens. It's very well located. 
13812118,105506396,2016-10-02,96806888,Katerina,"Το διαμέρισμα είναι στην κατάλληλη θέση για να εξερευνήσει κάποιος το κέντρο της Αθήνας, είναι πρόσφατα ανακαινισμένο και δεν διαφέρει καθόλου από τις φωτογραφίες για αυτό. Ο ιδιοκτήτης είναι εξαιρετικά ευγενικός, φιλόξενος και διακριτικός, και μας υποδέχτηκε έχοντας φροντίσει την παραμικρή λεπτομέρεια για τη διαμονή μας. Όλα ήταν καθαρά, τα ντουλάπια ήταν γεμάτα με όλα όσα θα ήθελε ένας επισκέπτης και ο ιδιοκτήτης ήταν πρόθυμος να βοηθήσει στο όποιο τυχόν πρόβλημα. Έχοντας εμπειρία από bnb στο εξωτερικό, θεωρώ πως η ιδιοκτησία και η φιλοξενία του Παντελή είναι από τις κορυφαίες. Το ότι θα μείνουμε ξανά στο χώρο αυτό είναι το μόνο σίγουρο. Ευχαριστούμε πολύ Παντελή!"
13812118,106402130,2016-10-05,69478491,Rosie,"Thank you Pantelis for a beautiful and easy stay in Athens! The apartment is exactly as the photos indicated. The pantry was stocked with some essential groceries, which was very welcome. The wifi, air-conditioning and bathroom were all excellent. The location is great, we walked everywhere we wanted to go. All of his restaurant recommendations that we tried were gorgeous (and close, so we didn't have to walk too far with full bellies)! 
<br/>
<br/>Would 100% recommend this location and Pantelis as host!"
13812118,106638573,2016-10-07,8141913,Slava,"Modern apartment right in the heart of Plaka. Such a delight being only a few steps away from the Acropolis and yet tucked away on a quiet street so noise isn't a problem. Pantelis met us on arrival and showed us everything, including a book of recommendations to familiarize ourselves with the neighborhood. Doesn't feel touristy at all even though it's as central as it gets. We also loved the modern amenities, from high pressure shower to comfortable beds to a welcoming bottle of wine. Easy choice for a couple, friends, or family to enjoy Athens!"
13812118,106802677,2016-10-08,1879118,Irene,"I unfortunately spent just one night in Pantelis' lovely flat...I wish I had more time to enjoy its amenities and great location. Pantelis was a great host, super communicative and very flexible (he welcomed us in the middle of the night, after we arrived from a late night ferry trip, with a smile!). I recommend his flat as a perfect place to stay in Athens and from which to explore the city. "
13812118,107385307,2016-10-10,78295187,Christabelle,"Pantelis's apartment was a great intro to the beginning of our Greece vacation! Pantelis was quick to answer all of my questions prior to our stay. Even when we found out about the impending airport strike the night before our departure, Pantelis was extremely helpful in trying to help us find alternate travel options. This was great customer service in our opinion - helped ease our worries. <br/><br/>As a travel agent, I am always in search of great places to recommend to my clients. Not only does Pantelis have awesome customer service, the location of his apartment is spot on. Easy walking distance to the Acropolis, Ermou Street, delicious Greek eateries, the metro stations, and so much more.  <br/><br/>The apartment looks exactly as shown in the pictures. We are extremely happy that we chose to stay here and will be recommending Pantelis's apartment to all our family, friends, and my travel clients. Special thanks to Pantelis's assistant, Dio, who provided an early morning transfer to the airport for us since the Metro was not operating at those hours.     <br/><br/>Thank you again, Pantelis!!!"

We were attracted by how mordern and contemporary it was which lead us to book it and were not disappointed upon arrival. Definitely in the centre of everything. Pantelis was an excellent host and very welcoming. He was very knowledgeable and efficient and provided us with useful sightseeing advice. He went out of his way to help us on several occasions by arranging taxis and finding out information for us. He was extremely helpful when I had my phone stolen by lending me his laptop. If I ever come to visit Athens I would definitely stay here again. Thank you once again to Pantelis for making our stay so comfortable!

His apartment is in the perfect location - in Plaka (safe, nice neighborhood), within walking distance to the metro, shops, restaurants and the main sights.  With regard to the apartment, it is exactly as you see in the pictures - modern and clean.  Pantelis was nice enough to leave us drinks and light food in the apartment, in addition to letting us leave our bags at his shop (around the corner from the apartment) since our plane didn't leave until the evening, which we greatly appreciated.  As long as the apartment is available, we will stay there next time we are in Athens.  Definitely recommend!  :)"

Thanks to his advices on where to visit and eat, we utilized a spontaneous unorganized 2 nights trip and turned it into one of the best getaways ever! He's organized a guide in 4 different languages, delicious breakfast snacks and fresh basket of fruits were cherry on the top. During our two days we never had to use a cab thanks to the perfect location of the flat. Lastly on our last day we decided to take a visit to the Aegina Island for few hours and it was incredible but our return boat that was supposed to leave the island at 4 was canceled due to heavy wind so we had to take the slow ferry at 5 which arrived to Athens port at 6:20 and our flight was at 8:00!! So, Pantelis being our hero came to rescue. He arranged a private cab and closed our luggages took them from the flat to the cab, when the ferry was approaching the port our cab was right in front of us! We jumped into the cab and our amazing driver managed to get us to the airport just on time he even made sure we knew our gate and lead us to the security. We are very thankful to them, words can't explain how great they have been so all we can say is DONT THINK TWICE YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR APARTMENT JUST BOOK IT! Can't wait to come back and say a proper goodbye to our host next time!"

Besides offering a most luxurious beautiful apartment you provided us with all the information we needed to have a great time in the heart of Athens. Where to eat, what to see and how to get there. The thing that made us most happy is that Pantelis is such a nice guy, social and very committed in his care for his tenants. He is not the person to just say 'here you have the key and have fun' but is there from beginning to the end. While suddenly needing a dentist, he not only listened but even brought us there and waited for us ! Having stayed at many b&b's and therefore being able to compare I have to say that this kind commitment is not obvious.  Don't hesitate for a second, just book his apartment !"

I knew that the apartment was going to be quite central, but I had no idea it would be so close to everything. Metro station, shops, restaurants, cathedral, acropolis, it's all only a few minutes' walk away -- fantastic! Even though the apartment is so central, it was still quiet so I got some great sleep in the cozy bedroom. The apartment itself is brand-new from the inside -- super fresh and clean, comfortable sofa, kitchen, good shower, large TV with YouTube and Netflix, airco... Perfect! Pantelis even provided me with some basic groceries like orange juice, fruit and cake -- so thoughtful. Would love to come back to Athens and next time I'll for sure stay with Pantelis!"

He also checked-in during the visit to make sure things were going well and see if we needed anything. Pantelis is a top-notch host. The apartment is also great. The pictures are accurate and it is very well maintained. The apartment was in a lively part of town, but on a side street that is incredibly quiet. The internet works well and is high speed. The kitchenette is stocked with food and water, which was a nice surprise after a day of traveling. The apartment is well situated within walking distance of  major attractions and only about a 15 minute walk from the Acropolis. Will definitely stay here again if we return to Athens. "

From the moment we booked he helped us decide how to get from the airport, booked us a reliable transfer to the port when we left and even offered to watch out luggage as we arrive well before check in. He stocked the fridge with a small breakfast and also included a bottle of wine! <br/><br/>Our stay well exceeded our expectations. We loved our stay in Athens!"

13812118,150935085,2017-05-10,21230964,Diana,The perfect place to stay in Athens.  The apartment is spacious and has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The apartment is located in a great spot to walk to all the historic monuments.  It's also in a great neighborhood a few blocks from shops and restaurants.  The street is a side street so it's not very loud (which we loved).<br/><br/>Pantelis was a wonderful host and was able to accommodate us with any ask.  Will stay here next time we are in Athens!  Thank you Pantelis.
13812118,151281202,2017-05-12,14336376,Mila,We had a lovely stay and onky wished we got to stay for more than one night. Pantelis was accommodating to our travel itinerary and helpful with directions and other information. 
13812118,151873471,2017-05-14,24769290,Jenny,Panteli's flat was amazing. It was clean organized and in the best location to explore Athens. He was a wonderful host who coordinated our travel from the port and back to the airport. I only wish we could have stayed longer. He was a wonderful host and I will recommend his place to anyone looking to visit Athens! 
13812118,152529523,2017-05-17,112146020,Abbie,Pantelis was very welcoming and generous. Our stay was awesome.  Amazing location and  a book full of helpful tips that hotels do not have. I would deffenitly recomend

Pantelis was very present during our whole stay in athens. You have everything for breakfast, he was in every detail! We also recommend the transfer by taxi to the airport! Everything was perfect!"
13812118,153428775,2017-05-21,91552429,Annemieke,"Pentalis is an extraordinary host who went out of his way to help us - not just during our stay in Athens, but throughout our whole time in Greece. We absolutely could not fault the service he gave us. <br/><br/>The apartment is lovely! Modern, clean, and spacious. It has everything you need, and a few extras too. The location couldn't be better - you are guaranteed to have a positive experience of Athens when staying in this lively, clean, and safe area. <br/><br/>Would not hesitate to stay here again. 10/10!"
13812118,154535167,2017-05-25,120106259,Marcos,"Pantelis' apartment is beautiful and in the heart of Plaka.  The apartment is near many restaurants, shops, and so close to the Acropolis.  I was very impressed.  Pantelis set up a private transfer to pick us up from the airport straight to his apartment.  Although it was 5 euros more than a cab, it was totally worth it.  When entering his apartment, he had light snacks, water, juice, coffee, tea, and a bottle of wine waiting for us.  The area is quiet.  We had no issues with noise and slept well.  His apartment has WiFi and a TV to catch up on world news.  He also had a binder full of information with places to visit and restaurants to eat at.  We appreciated that.  Pantelis was very friendly and always willing to help.  All should strongly consider his place!!!<br/><br/>On a sepeate note, i want to warn all travelers of pick-pocketers.  I was a victim as some one took my phone (not near Pantelis' apartment).  I just wanted to warn all that if you see kids selling flowers be very careful.  No one ever thinks that young kids (10 years old) would be so good at pick pocketing.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"
13812118,154757249,2017-05-26,16678091,Elizabeth,Pantelis was a wonderful host. He made sure we got into the apartment and settled in. He also provided a book of great tips and offered many additional recommendations for the area. I would highly recommend staying here!

There was some noise at night and in the morning but that was expected for staying in the heart of the city. Highly recommended!
13812118,156993416,2017-06-02,108477812,Audrey,"Pantelis was a phenomenal host with a phenomenal property! This was my first time using airbnb and he made the entire process so easy and wonderful.

We arrived at this immaculate  apartment at 10pm and Panteli was there awaiting our arrival. after a long 24 hour flight this was the most ideal place to stay. very central and a short walking distance to all the cafes and restaurants.

We stayed here with our 1.5year old son and couldn't be happier with our stay. The locations is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. You will not find a better location to stay, would absolutely recommend to families. There is no street noise and the shower in the apartment is divine! Pantelis helped arrange a transfer service for us from the airport and to our ferry port which was invaluable after a long travel leg with a toddler. We loved the apartment and location so much so that my husband wanted to shorten our other travel arrangements to return! Unfortunately the apartment is booked but we would definitely stay here again and again and recommend to all of our family and friends! If you are considering this apartment - BOOK IT. You will not be disappointed. "

13812118,166695927,2017-07-04,5942906,Catherine,"We were so lucky to find this place! We booked it pretty last minute (a few weeks out) and were thrilled with how central the location was and how nice and comfortable the apartment was, but most of all, what a gracious host Pantelis was. He was incredibly thoughtful throughout our entire stay. He provided clear directions to help us get from the airport to the apartment with different options for subway, bus, private car, uber, etc. We choose subway, which was the cheapest option and very convenient. It was really hot while we we were in Athens, so Pantelis recommended historical sites that we visit do later in the day when the sun wasn't so strong, which was really helpful. His apartment was lovely and very comfortable, with air conditioning in both rooms, a nice shower, all the amenities you would get from a hotel and then some-- it was the best of both worlds in terms of comfort and a closer look at Athens. Thank you, Pantelis!"
13812118,167013442,2017-07-05,90234172,Holly,"Pantelis's apartment is the PERFECT spot to explore Athens. We couldn't be happier with our stay, so much so we cancelled other plans to return to this amazing apartment at the end of our stay. The apartment is fully equipped and exactly as pictured, the amazing shower was a welcome find after a long day of travel. Pantelis assisted us with seamless transfers from the airport and back as well as to and from the ferry ports. Could not recommend this apartment highly enough, it was absolutely perfect for us, especially travelling with our young son (20 months). I would recommend any couples, singles or families like ours to book without delay, you cannot find a better spot or host in all of Athens! "

13812118,170164099,2017-07-15,100108061,John,"The apartment is in s brilliant location, central to transport, acropolis, museums etc. The room itself was outstanding for us. The photos don't do it justice, as it meticulously maintained and the fixtures and fittings are of high quality. Last but not least, Pantelis, our host, was outstanding in helping with the little things, such as finding the right spot for our hire car, as well as giving us the locals tips on where to eat and when to visit certain places. He was always available for anything we needed. Put all together, it made for a great start to our long awaited holidays. "

Excellent ammenities and decor (nice touch on the lighting and electric window shutters). Pantelis was a super host. He was on top of everything to make sure we had everything we needed, including having beverages and snacks for our arrival (which he didn't need to do). He helped us with our luggage (thank you!) and also helped us coordinate our transfer to the airport. To top this off, the aparment is centrally located, only 1 block from Plaka shops/restaurants, and a couple of blocks from Syntagma square. The Acropolis is right there too. You won't find anything better. I highly recommend Pantelis apartment."

13812118,173421943,2017-07-23,6426047,Shelley,"This was my first stay at an Airbnb internationally and I was very pleased with the host Pantelis and his flat. He was very quick to respond to my questions prior to arriving.<br/>The flat is located in the Plaka and only about a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis. It is about 40 minutes from the airport. Pantelis arranged for us to have a private transfer to pick us up from the airport. I recommend using the private transfer. Both of our drivers were friendly, professional, punctual and fast!<br/>The flat itself is very nice! It has a decent sized bedroom and a nice sized living area with an extra couch/pull out bed. The bathroom had a very nice shower and was very clean.  The kitchen was well stocked with coffee and tea and small continental breakfast items.  All of the essentials are there. We didn't use the kitchen much as we were spending our time enjoying all of the wonderful restaurants in the area! <br/>I highly recommend staying here while in Athens. Pantelis was a wonderful host and his place is very nice! I hope to come back again!"

Many of the sights are in walking distance. <br/><br/>The apartment is modern, cozy, and well-furnished. The bedroom goes to the back and is very quiet. The area is very safe given prominent neighbors. <br/><br/>The host has been very responsive and gracious with his help, arranging transfers, restaurant tips, flexible checkout as nobody was arriving the day of our departure. <br/><br/>We would immediately return to this apartment....and in fact we will next weekend...<br/><br/>Thank you Pantelis!"
13812118,177569985,2017-08-03,14250505,Vasilios,"Yet another winner on AirBNB.  Location is perfect.  The apartment is close both the train and metro lines.  Athens has several transit options.  This is something that some people may not be aware of.  So this apartment is just perfect for transit.  It is also in the heart of both Plaka and Monastiraki, 2 of the best places in Athens.  <br/><br/>Second, Panteli owns a store just below the apartment.  He is always available for help or questions.  <br/><br/>The area is secure and having a family of 5, we found this very important.<br/><br/>We visit Athens every year and we will definitely be back."

Will return!"
13812118,180037962,2017-08-09,4357100,Lavanya,"Pantelis' apartment is perfect for a stay in Athens. The apartment's proximity to many sites and great restaurants, not to mention the soothing decor, translate in such a way that at the end of a long, hot day walking around Athens you think of his place as a wonderful reprieve. In addition to the great apartment, Pantelis is also very helpful and kind. If I come back to Athens I would be delighted to stay here and re-connect with Pantelis."

Dio was very knowledgeable on the area and gave us an overview of the hot spots to visit.  Communiction throughout was consistent and we really appreciated his tips and suggestions.<br/><br/>Accommodation: <br/>Pantelis's place has 1 bedroom, 1 washroom and living room with a half kitchen. The building where this Air BnB is older however Pantelis has done a great job in renovating his apartment to a modern looking apartment with all the amenities.<br/><br/>Location:<br/>Situated in the plaka district, Pantelis's place is central to everything in town.  Minutes walk from the Acropolis, city center for shopping and restaurants.  <br/><br/>Overall:<br/>We enjoyed our time here and found that the location and value was superb."

The location is stellar if you want to stay in Athens for a couple of nights and see the Acropolis and other ancient ruin sites. Plaka is a very lively part of Athens close to excellent restaurants, shopping and bars. <br/>I looking forward to visiting Athens again and staying at this apartment."
13812118,185652885,2017-08-22,39940092,Ellen,"Pantelis was a fantastic host. We were worried that we wouldn't be able to find a place to stay in Athens because our flight was scheduled to arrive late at night, but Pantelis was more than accommodating. When we arrived he gave us a thorough tour of the apartment and advised us of good restaurants in the area that we could visit for breakfast and lunch. I was so impressed to see that he had provided us snacks and tea in the cabinet and a binder full of information on local attractions. The apartment is perfectly situated near the Acropolis and great restaurants. We highly recommend staying at his apartment if you find yourself in Athens!"

13812118,187111827,2017-08-26,5016994,Melanie,"First and foremost, this apartment has the perfect location for exploring Athens, particularly the Plaka and Acropolis, which were both short walks away.  Several delicious restaurants within a 5 minute walk as well (the one Pantelis recommended for traditional Greek food right up the street was amazing).  Bedroom was 100% quiet and on the inside of the building, which is important for me as I'm a light sleeper.  A/C was a godsend in the hot weather!  The rainforest shower was great too, though note you have to turn on the water heater for about 15 mins in advance to have enough hot water for a ~10 min shower.  Pantelis was a great host- communication was fine, and for any questions we did have, he was only just a phone call away.  Highly recommend."

Nous avons très bien dormi, il n y avait pas de bruit, la décoration est moderne et agréable. Pantelis et son ami Costas sont très sympathique, une bouteille de vin, crackers et de l'eau au frais nous attendaient à notre arrivée. Je vous conseille L'appartement de Pantelis car il est très bien situé, vous y trouverez tous ce qu'il vous faut pour un bon séjour. Merci encore à Pantelis pour ses conseils et nous avoir recommandé un taxi pour le Pirée."

We purchased the €30 mutli-site ticket voucher, and we were able to walk to all 7 sites (including the Acropolis) from the apt over two days. The apartment was really clean and super comfortable, and the area felt really safe too. Pantelis was super helpful and communcative during the check-in process. He helped us arrange an airport pick-up when we arrived, so everything was stress free (the driver took us right to the apartment, and Pantelis owns a shop right around the corner, so we didn't have to worry about getting lost). Would highly recommend this apt and Pantelis as a host - thanks so much for a great visit, if we are ever back n Greece, we would love to stay again!"

It helps when you have a host like Pantelis.  We arrived before our check in, which he was made aware of, and instead of just allowing us to drop off our bags to go walk around after a long trip, he allowed us to rest in another room while our room was being readied for us.  I can't thank you enough for making us feel at ease, thanks Pantelis!"

Wonderful location, well decorated apartment with hot water and comfortable bed.  There was even Netflix.  Pantelis was a wonderful host and answered all questions we had and pointed us in the right direction when we missed our ferry to Santorini.  He had restaurant recommendations and the apartment is minutes away from everything you want to see or do."

He was very communicative, thorough with the check-in process, arranged our private transfers from/to the airport, and overall very accommodating. Our flight arrived well before check-in time and he was kind enough to let us leave our luggage in his shop while we explored the area before check-in. He gave us a through walk through of the listing and provided light breakfast items in the pantry as well as drinks in the fridge. Pantelis also provided a binder with recommendations (sites to see, restaurants, closest groceries, etc.) The listing itself was exactly as pictured and clean. It is very central to everything and within walking distance of the acropolis, shopping, restaurants, and more. The air conditioning was a relief during the hot afternoons and the electric shades in the living room made it a great place to take a nap if needed (which we definite did!) This is a great listing which I recommend!"

Check in and check out were incredibly easy.  The apartment itself was clean, modern and had everything you needed.  I had read in reviews that the shower had amazing pressure (which may have influenced us even more to book his place!) and they were right! It was a great change after two weeks traveling through Greece with terrible water pressure.<br/><br/>The apartment is in a great area, I wish we were staying longer than one night to enjoy it even more.  Would definitely stay there again when I return to Athens!"
13812118,197588792,2017-09-26,107524817,P,"Firstly, if you are reading this and the flat is available for your holiday dates, simply stop reading now and book it before you miss out!<br/><br/>Everything about this flat is excellent! Host (Pantelis is the embodiment of the Greek ""Filoxenia"" which is much more than hospitality, it is a generosity of spirit), location (location, location, location! - walk to all the main spots in Athens, with minimal effort), safety, accessibility, comfort, cleanliness, equipment, etc can't be beaten!<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and book this quiet and wonderful oasis in the centre of Athens as your sanctuary and retreat for your stay in this bustling and beautiful city!<br/><br/>Thank you, Pantelis!"
13812118,197855148,2017-09-27,7993523,Alex,Pantelis is a great communicator and we enjoyed his place very much. It is clean and easily accessible. Would def recommend.
13812118,198701811,2017-09-30,6179184,Maroa,"Stedet til Pantelis er perfekt for en weekend-tur til Athen! Du bor midt i sentrum, med gåavstand til alt av restauranter og severdigheter. Leiligheten er moderne og er utstyrt med alt du trenger. Pantelis var alltid tilgjengelig og hjalp til når det trengtes. Anbefales! Kommer gjerne tilbake!"
13812118,199082676,2017-10-01,30729956,Chris,Very central and convenient location. The apartment is newly renovated and very clean. Pantelis owns a shop below the apartment which makes checking in easy. Would stay again.
13812118,200096826,2017-10-04,30545356,Cameron,"I have stayed at various hotels around Athens, and Pantelis' apartment was by far my favorite home base for this city. It's perfectly located at the edge of the busy/urban Syntagma neighborhood and the touristy Plaka neighborhood--bringing restaurants and attractions in those areas close at hand--but it feels quieter and more residential, in an appealing way. The apartment was very stylish, clean, and a comfortable place to come home to. I am a very light sleeper, so I appreciated that--in addition to being located on a quiet street--the bedroom is tucked in the even quieter back of the apartment. Pantelis greeted us on arrival and was helpful throughout. I enjoyed it so much that I extended my stay. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Athens."
13812118,200558749,2017-10-06,13542939,Joanna,"Pantelis was a gracious, helpful and hospitable host. The apartment was exactly as described and very centrally located to all the major Athens sites. We especially appreciated how Pantelis was able to quickly and easily get us a transfer to the airport, especially since we asked for an early morning ride the night before. He went above and beyond and we would definitely stay again!"
13812118,201813377,2017-10-09,147403022,Kayla,"The location was ideal. It allowed us easy access to the main tourist sites and restaurants. In addition, the apartment was near the flea market and other shops. During the day and into the early evening the location is a bit noisy if you have the windows open, but the noise was not an issue at night when we were trying to sleep. The host was very accommodating by allowing us to check in early since the previous tenants were gone. If checking in early was not an option, he offered to allow us to store our luggage at his shop. Pantelis was readily available for any questions or concerns that we may have had and I would definitely recommend his apartment to future visitors."
13812118,202422500,2017-10-11,52423007,Lizzy,"This apartment was perfect! Very clean and modern, looked even better than the photos. Amazing location in Plaka, safe and lively neighborhood. Pantelis gave us suggestions for restaurants and even gave us a map of Athens. Walking distance to all of the sights and the best bars and restaurants in Athens. We had a wonderful stay and would come back again!"

He is easy to communicate with and thoughtful. His apartment is beautiful and clean and has everything you could want or need. It is also in what I would consider the best location in Athens for touring around.

13812118,209333998,2017-11-05,46941999,Alan,"Pantelis and his place were both excellent. The apartment is located in a great part of town, truly just steps from all the places you’d want to explore in Athens. The apartment is very stylish and comfortable and had clearly been kept meticulously clean. He has a huge tv, a stocked tea cabinet and he left us a complimentary bottle of wine. I felt like I was staying with a friend and the only issue was that we couldn’t stay longer. I wish this guy owned property in other cities so we could stay there too. Well done Pantelis!"
13812118,212772358,2017-11-19,136892586,Kyle,"Pantelis was a wonderful host.  Great communication before we arrived in Athens.  Upon arrival, he escorted us to the apartment, and gave us a quick run-down of the features.  The location is very good, right in the heart of the Plaka.  Can easily walk to the sights and restaurants; don't really need to use public transportation.  If I came back to Athens, I would definitely stay here again!"
13812118,214634749,2017-11-26,150989491,Zachari,"Honestly Pantelis’ flat was picturesque! It was quite stunning. Pantelis himself is a wonderful and gracious host who showed us wonderful hospitality. The apartment/flat is wonderfully located right in Plaka, which is a nice little shopping neighborhood. The shops and restaurants there are nice! The walk to the Acropolis is about 10 minutes. I definitely will be staying here again my next trip to Athens."

Restaurants, supermarket and souvenir shops are all 2 mins way. Apartment is very clean and comfortable, and there are notes provided by Pantelis which are very helpful. Thoughtful gestures such as water and light breakfast are also provided by him which makes the stay extremely pleasant. All in all, apartment is great and what we are all looking for and Pantelis hospitality makes it even better :)"

13812118,331268485,2018-10-02,23787326,Meghan,"Pantelis' apartment was great and exactly as advertised.  Clean, perfectly located to explore Athens' highlights.  Would be happy to stay again!<br/><br/>Some highlights: <br/>-It rained the whole time we were in Athens and he offered us GREAT umbrellas which allowed us to keep site seeing despite the weather.  <br/>-Getting/returning the keys was super easy.  His shop is directly around the corner from the apartment (we had trouble finding the shop but eventually figured it out) and you leave the keys in the unit when you check-out which is a great time saver.<br/><br/>Some FYIs:<br/>-The shower is a bit funky for hot water.  It's an easy process (press a button, wait for a timer to go off) but the first person who showered consistently  had less than 5 minutes of hot water (the second person had longer).  May have been user error but it wasn't great.<br/>-You may have to restart the wifi.  It turns off when you're out of the unit and reboots (usually quickly) when you get back and insert the key in the wall.  We ran into a few issues of waiting ~30 minutes and it not restarting."

Food in every direction. The place is decorated amazingly. Pantelis let us have the apartment till 6:30 pm which was wonderful. If we come back to Athens we would definitely want to stay here again.

The apartment is well equipped with all amenities that you need on a holiday and is kept neat and well maintained. All key tourist places are at walking distance. Huge range of selection of restaurants in the neighborhood.  Although we preferred vegetarian food there were many restaurants in walking distance, including couple of Indian restaurants also. Highly recommend this place for one and all."
13812118,470385013,2019-06-16,145777212,Harold,"Pantelis provided a perfect spot for a traveling duo or couples in the heart of Plaka at the foot of the Acropolis.  This was my first AirBnB experience ever and luckily Pantelis made it a memorable and rewarding one.   Pantelis met us at his shop which is just right around the corner of the apartment, which is super convenient given he's close by if you need him to answer things throughout the first day or so.  I would definitely consider coming back to his place for my next Athens trip!  Highly recommend his Plaka spot!"

13812118,524986138,2019-09-07,3598079,Kristina,"When my Mom suggested we check out AirBnB, I was a little reluctant because she's very picky about choosing places to stay. I'm happy to share that we could've not been any luckier with choosing Pantelis  little Cozy apartment. <br/><br/>Situated in the old Plaka district of Athens, it perfect location is only few minutes away from major attractions, taverns and shops. Location is very safe and easy to navigate. Whether you choose to sightseeing, grab a coffee or tourist browse the shops, all you have to do is, blink your eyes and you are there.<br/><br/>The place is very cozy, very well maintained and supplied with all you basic necessities. Even more, the host provided cold bottled water, Apple juice, coffee and tea, and small snacks as a compliment. <br/><br/>Pantelis  is fantastic host. Prior to our arrival he offered airport transfer assistance. The gentleman that picked us up, was very friendly and professional. During the 30 min ride from the airport, he gave us brief overview of his ancient Greek history, suggested touring ideas, showed us and told us ins and outs of the city.<br/><br/>Upon arrival we were greeted by the host Pantelis who showed us our little home for the next few days. Throughout our stay he was only few minutes away via text and assisted us with any questions or needs that we had. Suggested a place for quick bite upon our almost midday arrival and by all means, this was the best souvlaki that I've ever had - Kostas. The host assisted as also with transfer to the airport in the early morning hours when we left.<br/><br/>Highly recommend this little cozy place. I will definitely return to this place, if I come back to Athens."

It's right in the middle of everything: shopping, restaurants, tourist areas, historic sites, local neighborhoods, grocery stores, public transfer hubs. Simply perfect.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is quaint comfortable and charming. It has everything you could need for a couple of weeks, plenty of space, very modern, filled with light and meticulously clean.<br/><br/>Pantelis is also a great host, kind and warm, giving you the sense of being welcome instantly as a part of Athens, not just as a visitor. I'm thankful that I had a chance to meet him and that he's willing to share such an extraordinary space."

He is quick to respond online and in-person and that was much appreciated. The location was so central to Athens and is very walkable to a lot of restaurants and the Acropolis. I would definitely stay at his home again next time we’re back in Athens."

Within walking distance—mere minutes—to the main tourist destinations like the Acropolis, Ancient Agora, and Panathenaic stadium. Though a bit farther, we also walked to the National Archaeological Museum. If you’re looking to eat traditional Greek food nearby, head on over to Stamatopoulos. It’s fantastic. It came recommended by Pantelis. Which brings me to our host. A truly wonderful man. Hospitable, responsive, and very helpful. You’ll love your stay here."
13812118,404752363730620513,2021-07-12,106115256,Lora,"Pantelis is a wonderful host! <br/><br/>He was unable to meet us for check in, but we met his daughter at his shop (literally just around the corner) and she let us in and showed us everything we needed to know. We did meet Pantelis later in the trip, though! <br/><br/>The fridge was full stocked with juices, sodas, water, and a bowl full of apples. The cabinets had coffee, teas, condiments, and a loaf cake, as well as plenty of dishes. <br/><br/>The apartment itself is lovely. Perfect size for 2 people. My mom slept in the bedroom and I slept on the pull out sofa. There are plenty of towels, sheets, pillows, etc. <br/><br/>The apartment is in an absolutely wonderful location. Walking distance to just about everything in Athens! The only times we needed to use transit were to/from the airport and getting to Piraeus Port and Marina Zeas. <br/><br/>I highly recommend a stay with Pantelis and would gladly stay again myself next time I find myself in Athens!"

The apartment is beautiful and in a great location, minutes away and walking distance to the Acropolis and its surrounding sites to visit.  By far one of the cleanest and best stays during our time in Greece.<br/><br/>Pantelis goes above and beyond to ensure you have the directions you need and he went even further to allow us to drop off bags early so that we could lighten our one bag travel backs and sightsee before checkin. He helped us navigate our way to a few nearby locations and helped us find an efficient clinic to get our mandatory covid test before our flight. <br/><br/>Highly recommend staying here if you are going to be in Athens touring the main historical sites and enjoying everything it has locally!"

We were here for eight days, and the longer we stayed, the more we appreciated the location -- it is walking distance to everything! And yet the bedroom is very quiet, so noise really isn't an issue at night. It's also near the Syntagma metro station, so getting to and from the airport is not difficult. The apartment itself is more spacious than we expected, and the wifi works great. We would recommend it to anyone who wants to see the main sights in Athens."

Near from bus station, supermarket, restaurant and a lot of interesting cafes right in the neighbourhood. It's very near Sintagma square and all interesting historical landmarks. The apartment was with everything we needed. Helena met us at the apartment  and showed us around. She's so kinde and definitely one of  the reasons why our trip was awesome!!!"

Когда мы брали напрокат машину, помогала лично решить один вопрос. Мы приехали 25 декабря вечером, и несмотря на Рождество,  Елена подождала нас до 20:00. На столе нас ждали бутылка вина и рождественские угощения. :)<br/>Апартаменты. Все фото соответствуют действительности. Немного далековато от центра (пешком), но не сильно. Район тихий, в 30 метрах есть супермаркет, круглосуточный магазин. Недалеко кофейни. В 50-100 м автобусная остановка, есть прямой маршрут до Акрополя. Если вы на машине, легко найдёте парковку на этой улице. <br/>Жильё предназначено для двоих, втроём там будет совсем тесно. <br/>Центрального отопления нет, обогревались кондиционерами. Иногда выбивает пробки, если включить сразу оба кондея вместе с бойлером, поэтому включайте их по отдельности. Пол плиточный, зимой прохладно. <br/>Мебель новая, всё чисто. На кухне чай, кофе, приправы, оливковое масло, печеньки. Кухонной утвари для завтрака более, чем достаточно. <br/>Определённо будем рекомендовать эти апартаменты "

The flat was well equipped and felt very warm and homely.   A selection of nice restaurants were only a short walk away, and it was easy to walk or take the bus to the city centre."

I really loved it and totally recommend it to everyone. Elena was a lovely host and always easy to communicate with! The appartment was very clean, very cosy, perfectly equipped with everything you need even for a long stay and located in a really nice and central area! Panepistimio metro station is about 10-15 minutes by walk and the bus stop is right at the corner. It's a safe neighborhood, there are several supermarkets, bakeries, little shops and great cafes and restaurants.<br/>The appartment was not very bright though..however, that might be a great advantage in hot summer days:) also the bathroom is quite tiny but it was not a real problem to me. <br/>I'm so grateful for this amazing experience and already missing Elena's appartment!"

Bis zur Innenstadt sind es fußläufig 30 Minuten, aber wer lieber bis in die Stadt fährt kann in 2 Minuten zur Bushaltestelle gelangen. Die nächste Metro Station ist ca. 15 Minuten Fußweg entfernt. Die Kommunikation mit Helena war sehr schnell und unkompliziert, eine tolle Gastgeberin!"

13813140,288071943,2018-07-09,2181559,Alicia,"Everything was as described and shown on the pictures. We had a very pleasant stay at Helena s flat located in a neighborhood with trendy cafes not far from the center of Athens. The apartment was very clean, very comfy bed, air con (very important in Athens) and all amenities included. It is a fresh apartment for the summer as it is not exposed to sun light too much during the day. Helena was very nice and communication was easy. "
13813140,292092161,2018-07-17,49223171,Fran,We loved our stay at Helena’a place! The apartment was very clean and comfortable with great aircon which was a must in 40 degree heat. The location is amazing - near lots of restaurants and cafes and walking distance to the Acropolis and other tourist sites. Highly recommend.
13813140,302149265,2018-08-05,2647310,Peter,"I had a great time staying at Έλενα’s apartment. It was very clean and the air conditioning was a nice relief. The added washer and dryer was also very convenient. It was close to lots of great restaurants and local boutiques. Only about 20 mins walk to Mount Lycabettus for a beautiful view of the city. The taxi to Syntagma Square was only about 5€ with lots of other transportation options. Overall a great experience, I would definitely come back and stay again! Thank you Έλενα!"
13813140,320605275,2018-09-09,62529777,Linda,"The apartment is perfect for a stay in Athens, great hospitality, great tips and always help right away, if we needed any!"
13813140,328097624,2018-09-25,26197096,Fiona,"What a delightful little flat well situated on the bus route 230 which goes straight to the Acropolis. The flat had every convenience you would need for a visit to Athens. We were backpacking and grateful to have a washing machine to do our laundry. It is in a very quiet neighbourhood so no noise at night. We wish we had been staying longer. Helena is a terrific host and looks after your every need, helping us with our onward transport from Athens too.  I would highly recommend this accommodation."
13813140,337392776,2018-10-16,182884289,Kelly,"One of the best places I’ve stayed. Helena was a lovely lovely host, so friendly and helpful. The apartment was perfect, so sweet and cozy and had everything you could need. So many thoughtful touches and comfy extras. The location for me was perfect, it was close enough walk to anything, or the buses and metro were near by. It’s also right near one of the most breathtaking scenic views of the entire city.<br/>Loved it all.<br/>Thank you Helena!"
13813140,352301685,2018-11-25,136866325,Urs,It was my second stay and I will come back for sure.
13813140,436940913,2019-04-14,161572567,Alena,"Helena is extreeeemely friendly, made us laugh during the check-in & check-out a couple of times. She always replied within minutes and made us feel at home throughout our stay. The place is close to the center of the city (in a walking distance), a lot of amazing cafés, bakeries, supermarkets, a small hill to hike up... everything you need.<br/>Thank you once again ♥"

Also, in the apartment is a detailed 'guide book',  full of information regarding travel, eating, sight seeing etc., in the area.  Communication with Helena was excellent..thank you Helena!"
13813140,469132975,2019-06-14,263498783,Rachel,"Elena service was the best I have received since staying  in Airbnb. She was very warm and welcoming and she waited for me when my flight was delayed. Her house was very clean and location was brilliant, the bus 230 took you straight to Acropolis. If I ever come back to Athens I shall stay here, and If you  go to Athens you should stay here."
13813140,476343600,2019-06-26,65474797,Aleksandar,"Helena was a very friendly and accommodating host, she gave us a warm welcome and a lot of useful informations about Athens. The communication was always easy and fast. The flat it's well located, few minutes from the city center."

Told me how to stay safe and gave me invaluable tips. The place was so clean and tidy and very comfortable. Would highly recommend and will be staying there again next trip to Athens :)"

L'appartement correspond parfaitement à la description - il est très calme et tout fonctionne bien - wifi et climatisation compris.. La cuisine est petite mais suffisamment bien équipée."
13813140,472953907696174351,2021-10-14,3374660,Frédérick,"Elena has been very responsive and helpful, and the flat was as announced."
13824992,144680381,2017-04-16,12804029,Atina,Gabriels place is just beautiful and so nice located. It's a jewel in Athens and Francee is a very kind and helpful host. Thank you that much!
13824992,146471745,2017-04-23,4153479,Kristi,"As one of the first guests to have stayed in this amazing apartment, we are happy to highly recommend this space.  It is beautifully designed and appointed, and in the heart of Athens.  As former New Yorkers, this apartment happily reminds us of our homes in Tribeca ... there is a somewhat gritty, urban entrance and two flights of stairs, but you will be rewarded for this effort by an amazing home to enjoy during your stay.  The location is perfect for exploring the city, and communication with Francee and Gabriel is easy, warm, and excellent.  We can't wait to return."
13824992,150562120,2017-05-08,13457530,Voicu,"This is one of the best places to stay in Athens and Monastiraki. Close to everything, yet not in the middle of the tourist area. iFeel cafe is 30 seconds away. It's quiet (except on the terrace during weekend evenings, where you can hear the music and local night life - this was a plus for me). I loved the aesthetics and craftsmanship of the interior design.<br/>There is also a high attention to detail, and everything is available. The only thing missing was a proper iron for ironing clothes.<br/>The internet worked flawlessly.<br/>Minor negative: the entry hallway in the building was crammed with random stuff. Also, from the pictures one might think that the terrace is on the interior of the building. It is in fact on the side of the building and you could look down to the pedestrian street (Esopou) two floors below. This arrangement is even better IMO, and I've spent a lot of the time planning my vacation on the terrace (the WiFi works very well there, as in the rest of the house)."
13824992,160729009,2017-06-15,34558935,Tricia,"What a fantastic apartment this is.  We loved the decor, and the area. Francee was really helpful, and met us to let us in. We felt very safe, everywhere was easy to get to. Even though the apartment is at the top of an old house, we felt safe, and I managed to get up the stairs with my broken foot. We found a little cafe down a little street that we made our local for breakfast, and it was nice to walk in every morning and they'd bring our coffee from memory. We loved sitting out on the deck playing backgammon and listening to the world go by. We so enjoyed wandering the streets then coming home to this beautiful apartment. The surrounding streets are full of fabulous tavernas, music and interesting buildings. We would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone. Nothing disappointed us, except not being able to stay longer. "
13824992,162005052,2017-06-19,53183136,Sam,No other apartment like this is the world. Every object curated and the space an absolute delight

13824992,172855185,2017-07-22,39860921,John,"Gabriel's place is beautiful.  It's got everything you need for your stay.  My husband and I stayed at Gabriel's place close to a month and couldn't have asked for a better location.  This place is close to EVERYTHING.  Walking distance to the market, bars, restaurants, metro station and shopping.  This place is well stocked with essentials needed for cooking.  I can go on and on about how comfortable we were here, the pictures don't do it justice.  Francee was amazing! She was very attentive with all our needs and her response time was always fast.  I would recommend staying here.  We truly felt like Greek residents.  We hope to be back soon.  Thank you Gabriel and Francee for your kindness and attention."
13824992,174241168,2017-07-25,1933732,Ben,Totally exceeded our expectations - the apartment and the location are amazing.  Communication with the host was super easy.  Can't rate the whole thing highly enough.
13824992,176532750,2017-07-31,535784,Andrew,"This is the place to stay in psiri Athens. I can't tell you what a great place, location, and host this listing has. One of the best air bnb I have ever stayed in."

13824992,193381888,2017-09-13,4186771,Judy,"We loved staying in this apartment! It was extremely comfortable, and beautifully decorated with interesting pieces from, I imagine, the homeowner's worldly travels.  The apartment is located in the thick of things, yet it is a peaceful oasis. We especially enjoyed having drinks on the spacious terrace.<br/><br/>Francee was fantastic with her communications, and her restaurant recommendations were spot on. She even personally came to check us in when we arrived well past midnight.<br/><br/>This is the perfect place to stay in Athens!"
13824992,197852796,2017-09-27,149664785,Mahek,"Gabriel's is a place you can call home!!<br/>Beautifully crafted interiors with utmost attention to detail, the terrace garden was a delight & to top it up was a well stocked kitchen.<br/>The apartment is conveniently located to restaurants and transportation. <br/>Additionally, all communication with Francee was quick, she aided us with a map and was responsive to all our queries. We had a perfect stay!"
13824992,207374827,2017-10-29,35222758,Nana,"An amazing house, beautiful, stylish but warm. Gives you a sense of india in its classy stylish way! Amazing location in the middle of the city centre but quiet. Exactly as seen in the pictures!"
13824992,250188411,2018-04-04,8525542,Lauren,"We had a lovely stay at Francee & Gabriel's place. Its in a very central location, close to all the historical attractions of Athens. The decor is lovely and the space peaceful.<br/>A short walk to some great cafes and eateries. <br/>Thanks for having us Francee!!!"
13824992,256082049,2018-04-22,5565546,Alice,"Das Apartment übertraf all unsere Erwartungen. Es ist perfekt für alle, die die Stadt erkunden wollen (da sehr zentral gelegen) und gleichzeitig auch etwas Entspannung und Ruhe suchen – denn die Dachterrasse ist bei tollem Wetter ein Ort, den man gar nicht so schnell wieder verlassen will. Wir sind jeden Morgen aufgewacht und hatten Freude daran, an so einem schönen Ort zu sein. Man merkt, dass die Wohnung mit Liebe und einem Sinn für Details eingerichtet worden ist, hier steckt sehr viel Persönlichkeit drin – eigentlich so, als würde man in der Wohnung eines guten Freundes übernachten. Die perfekt ausgestattete Küche, die Bose Soundbox und die tollen Korres-Pflegeprodukte wussten wir auch sehr zu schätzen! Kein Vergleich zu vielen anderen Ferienwohnungen. Wer die Stadt erkunden will, ist hier sehr gut aufgehoben, da  Vieles fußläufig ist und auch Restaurants und Bars in der Umgebung sind. Hier hat man eher die Qual der Wahl. Francee hat uns mit sehr guten Tipps versorgt, vielen Dank! Es war unser erster Besuch in Athen und wir reisen als große Fans der Stadt ab – diese Unterkunft hat einen großen Anteil daran. Wer abgesehen von der tollen Unterkunft noch etwas Entspannung sucht, ist in den nahegelegenen Hammam Baths auch sehr gut aufgehoben."
13824992,258002754,2018-04-28,30267579,Piotr,"I don't have enough nice things to say about this place. It is located on a somewhat noisy side street close to everything but you wouldn't know it from the serene, quiet space. We had stayed just across the street the previous weekend and were considering cancelling our booking because of the excessive late night noise from the neighboring restaurants but are extremely glad we stuck with it. We couldn't hear a single thing all night from the bedroom. <br/><br/>The space is really cool and inspirational. A lot of really nice unique touches and beautiful details. With framed fashion magazine covers lining the stairway up and chandeliers in every room you can't help but feel like you're staying in a glamorous space whose owner has poured a lot of care and personality into. It does seem lived in unlike some of the more sterile spaces you see elsewhere but that just makes it more cozy. More luxe than sleek. <br/><br/>The manager was very communicative and helpful. <br/><br/>Overall this stay was an absolute joy and worth every penny if you value a cool space you can relax in."
13824992,268866078,2018-05-26,82488215,Alex,A really unique place in the middle of an up-and-coming neighborhood
13824992,273746477,2018-06-07,4777393,Matt,"What a fantastic apartment, the photos don’t do it justice, one feels instantly at home and it’s so comfortable with everything you will ever need.<br/><br/>So well placed in the hustle and bustle but silent at night inside the apartment.<br/><br/>Will certainly return!<br/><br/>Best, Matt"
13824992,279213222,2018-06-20,16198186,Aris,Excellent!! The best Airbnb I have been to thus far!!
13824992,280932276,2018-06-24,36052786,Nicolai,We very much enjoyed the flat and the area. All good
13824992,288122204,2018-07-09,13457530,Voicu,"This is my second time staying at this place, and I loved it as much as the first time. It’s located right next to Oineas, an amazing restaurant. The apartment is completely quiet at all times, a very rare thing in the center of Athens. The communication with Francee was excellent. The internet was a problem this year, with poor download speed and nonexistent upload. There is some 3G coverage on the terrace which can be used for uploading. The kitchen is very well stocked, but it doesn’t make much sense to cook in Athens. I recommend iFeel cafe for breakfast. Try the Great Escape Room nearby, it’s very very good. <br/><br/>5 stars across the board."
13824992,311406733,2018-08-21,77928628,Javier,GREAT OPTION IF YOU WANT STAY IN MONASTIRAKI ZONE
13824992,324515177,2018-09-17,23827129,Carter,"Perfect apartment for visiting Athens! It is incredibly well decorated, with nice individual spaces so you and others can enjoy some quiet time or share a bottle of wine out on the terrace. Each touch in the apartment is deliberate and beautiful. Even though it is just a few blocks away from many restaurants, ruins, and markets, the apartment stays your own little oasis. Francee and Gabriel were great hosts, helping us book taxis from the port to the listing and helping us understand the area. This is a fantastic choice for anyone visiting Athens!"
13824992,329628702,2018-09-29,31574688,André,"Fantastic flat. Loved the rustic feel of the place. And a good bed.<br/>All located on the 2nd floor very central to the Acropolis and the city centre. (The important bit is that it is in the good part of town.)<br/>Sadly the weather was bad during my stay or I would have used the awesome terrace some as well. I was alone, but seems like the perfect getaway place for a couple too.<br/>Loved it!"

13824992,482158582,2019-07-06,42255725,Colin,Gabriel’s apartment is in a fabulous location and is so interesting and eclectic. We loved the chandeliers and the library and collectibles. It feels like a Paris apartment in the middle of Athens. Francee gave us great local tips on check in and was there whenever we needed anything - she went above and beyond what we expect of an Airbnb host. Thank you both for a great stay.
13824992,535317098,2019-09-24,203909641,Dereck,"Loved this place very stylish interior , amazing balcony, very close to centre and lots  of great places to eat. We loved every minute"

13824992,433734353777983401,2021-08-21,13610717,Spencer,"Francee was the most communicative host I think I've had. The apt was very clean. I chose the place because I particularly liked its style and the place fully delivers on that. The location is also great, close to Monistiraki Square, and the restaurants, etc. We stayed there twice actually on a two week trip in Greece (flying in and out of Athens) and I'd consider it again. Originally I wanted a place with a veranda with an Acropolis view, but her apt's veranda is so verdant, so rustically beautiful the feeling of being in a remote and beautiful villa felt better than having a view of the Acropolis!"
13824992,435923990396392734,2021-08-24,5340099,Denise,One of the best airbnb stats I have had. I would definitely return.

It is quiet but still near everything, a bakery, supermarket, bars and restaurants nearby and walkable to all the attractions.  Stelios and Yianna couldn't have been more helpful, from organising a taxi to pointing us in the right direction for the things we wanted to see. Wouldn't hesitate to come back here - highly recommended:-) "

We stayed on the beautiful terrace and he described us the area, tell us about things to do in Athens and the best places for having a coffee with sweets and a very good dinner.The appartment has all amenities described in the list, it is very elegant, decorated with a lot of taste by our host. It is situated just in the center of Athens, very close to Syndarma square and the Parliament and few steps from the main shopping street, Ermou.

<br/>La quartier n'a pas de charme particulier mais il est central, tout proche de la place Syntagme, du métro, du tram et des bus mais on peut tout faire à pieds. L'appartement est très propre, confortable et personnalisé avec une magnifique terrasse, on s'y sent vraiment bien!. Les lits sont confortables et il y a la climatisation dans les chambres.

Spiros met us at the bus terminus and took us to the appartment while Fillipos prepared some ouzou wine and olives to welcome us. They took their time to stay with us and share lots of useful information.

He also took us to the supermarket which is near by our apartment and show some places. Everything inside the apartment is exactly as the description, and they looked the same as the pictures shown on the websit. The apartment is at an excellent location! We found it extremely convenience! The neighborhood is very good, not too busy and we feel safe walking around there at night time. We enjoyed staying in the apartment so much!"

Ήταν πολύ καθαρό και οι φωτογραφίες δείχνουν ακριβώς πώς είναι. Το μετρό είναι πολύ κοντά, όπως και πολλά λεωφορεία. Όλα ήταν πολύ καλά και το σημαντικότερο είναι πως ο κύριος Φίλιππος ήταν πολύ ευγενικός κι εξυπηρετικός. Το συστήνω ανεπιφύλακτα! "

<br/>Apartment was as described and location is really good, but there are couple of noisy bars on the Street. They are playing loud music until about 01:00 am at weekends and until midnight during the week. But anyway, location is really good to see the city."

Filippos nous a rejoint sur la place pour nous guider vers l'appartement et nous montrer les lieux, nous offrant fromage et Ouzo. 
<br/>L'appartement est bien situé, très central, nous avons pu visiter Athènes sans prendre de metro ou de bus. Il faut en revanche se souvenir que le quartier est très vivant les soirs de WE, les bars ne fermant qu'au petit matin il y a pas mal de bruit en debut de nuit."

Moreover, Filippos organized our ride from the airport to the apartment which was highly appreciated late at night. <br/>The apartment is located in a great central location which allowed us to walk all day without using any other mode of transportation. My family had a great experience and we would love to stay at the apartment again. "
13831960,158889746,2017-06-09,43008140,Noël,Filipo's welcome was really nice. <br/>The flat is very well located. It is also quiet ( for a flat in a capital ) . <br/>The balcony is amazing and it's very nice to have a breakfast on it. <br/>I really recommend Filipo's  flat. It's a very cosy place and perfect location to visit Athens. <br/>
13831960,160452348,2017-06-14,17861848,Lucas,"We had a great time at Filippos's place. It was a real pleasure and uncomplicated interacting with him. His flat is really nice, clean and spacious. The absolute highlight is of course the large terrace, which can be used as a beautiful retreat in the hottest hours of the day. Moreover, the location is very central, everything is in walking distance. We can only recommed staying at Filippos's place!"
13831960,161243652,2017-06-17,25228462,Pierre,"Hands down the BEST Airbnb experience I've ever had. Filippos met up with us at the bus stop and we all walked over to his apartment. It was only a 5 minute walk from Syntagma Square. Filippos gave us a house tour and even prepared wine and cheese for us while telling us about the things to do in Athens. WOW! There were business cards laid out on the table with everything from taxis to recommended restaurants to tour services. We literally didn't have to do any research because Filippos provided all the information. But enough with the most amazing host ever, let's talk about the house. There are two bedrooms that comfortably fit 4 adults. The balcony terrace is definitely the selling point. It's huge with couches, tables, and provides a very relaxing feel. There is also a washing machine upstairs if clothes need to be washed. The only downside is the internet (10mbps down/1mbps up). It's fast enough for web surfing and streaming, but not fast enough if your work requires anything with uploading large data. Also, the elevator is small, since it is old style where you need to close the door before it moves. These upsides absolutely outweigh the downsides though. I can not recommend Filippos place enough! Will definitely stay at Filippos next time I go back to Athens."

13831960,165558355,2017-07-01,102765740,Laura,My husband and I went to Greece for our wedding and stayed in Athens a few nights. Filippos was great and his flat is beautiful. Check-in was very easy and he had fresh fruit and water in the fridge for us. He made it so easy to return to Athens at his place again after a week in Naxos. He is very responsive and was always willing to help. I would definitely recommend Filippos for anyone staying in Athens. His flat is well located and a short walk to Plaka and the Acropolis. 
13831960,166971702,2017-07-05,57071881,Kris,A great stay in fantastic Athens. The apartment was in a perfect location with everything at your doorstep. Restaraunts and bars very close by. Filippos was an amazing host with a friendly smile and full of knowledge of his home town. Highly recommended.

13831960,180265567,2017-08-10,106587427,Peter,The location of the apartment is so central and easy walking distance to all the major attractions of Athens. A little cramped for 5 people as there is only 1 shower. The laundry and second toilet in the loft (for slightly aged people) was difficult to get to . Very steep steps.<br/>Overall a wonderful time.
13831960,183845444,2017-08-18,65943412,Leland,"My daughter and I had a fantastic time at this apartment!  It was very comfortable and perfectly located.

En el corazón de la ciudad. Se puede visitar todo caminando. Nos alojamos dos parejas y realmente estuvimos super cómodos. Nos dio la  bienvenida con un aperitivo y en su casa había lo necesario para el desayuno.  Nos envió un taxi al  aeropuerto y otro para el regreso por 40 €. Estuvo en contacto permanente con nosotros y nos dio mapas y recomendaciones para recorrer la ciudad. Gracias Filippos... y Spiros que también se contactó con nosotros y a Juan el chofer del taxi. Todos ellos hicieron que nuestra estancia fuera ideal. Volveríamos a la casa de Filippos sin dudarlo

It was so strategically situated - easy to access from the airport/metro and also it is walking distance to all the key areas of interest. It had everything we needed and even more. Filippo provided us some stuff to munch & welcomed us with apéritif when we arrived. His place is clean and spacious and the terrace was a big plus to relax after a long-day of exploring amazing Athens and before going out in the evening for the superb and very reasonably priced Greek cuisine. Communications was easy and helpful from time of booking until departure. Highly recommended!

13831960,245175576,2018-03-21,20927163,Manuela,It's such a lovely apartment in a great neighbourhood. Absolutely amazing. The vibe in the apartment is better then any feng shui in the world :-) and superhost filippos is a man with a great heart! Efcharisto for everything! :)
13831960,248349062,2018-03-31,98318605,Daina,"If Filippos' air bnb is available, book it for your next trip to Athens.  His beautifully appointed apartment is centrally located, tasteful, tidy, and very comfortable. And as wonderful as his place is, it was  Filippos himself who made my family's stay magical. He knows so much about Greece, all the best places to eat and to sight see. He is gracious and hospitable, and went out of his way to ensure that we had a great Athens experience.  In talking with Filippos when we first arrived, he mentioned in passing that he was a jeweler by trade.  It so happened that one of the things my husband and I wanted to do in Greece was to purchase a new wedding ring for me.   Later that afternoon, while my husband and I were out looking for rings, I wondered if Filippos might be able to make one for me, so my husband texted him, and a couple of days later, I had a beautiful new ring, made just for me, and a great story to tell. I wholeheartedly recommend that you visit Filippos and his elegant apartment.  We will definitely visit again."

We felt like we were  at home.<br/> The apartment has everything that you need : a lot of clean towels, spare bedding, coffee and milk, cold water and ice etc. <br/>Host surprised us with fresh fruits when we came and he gave us a lot of interesting and important informations. He was also very welcoming and kind!<br/>The apartment is beautifully decorated and there were so many gorgeous details that left us astonished!<br/>However what  we loved the most was the balcony! It's really spacious with cosy chairs  and we spent most of our free time there.<br/>Filippos, thank you for your hospitality and we hope to see you again!"
13831960,261191995,2018-05-06,51497801,Tom,Great location and quite a large flat. S (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) many places for food and drinks nearby and right next to the main shopping area. An easy walk to all the main sites and public transport. Would stay here again if we are in Athens
13831960,262834381,2018-05-10,97645914,Liset,"Filippos is een fantastische gastheer.<br/>We werden uitgebreid ontvangen met verse aardbeien en veel tips over mooie plekjes en goede restaurantjes. De koelkast was al voor gevuld met allerlei dingen. Koffie en thee was ruim aanwezig en vrij te gebruiken.<br/>Het appartement is zeer goed beveiligd, groot en kan bijna niet op een betere locatie liggen dan hier. Vlak bij het openbaar vervoer, vlak bij Plakka, vlak bij Acropolis, vlak bij de winkelstraten, restaurantjes, bakkertjes, marktjes, etc. Allemaal op loopafstand. Daarbij is het appartement zeer ruim. Zowel binnen als buiten. Fijne douche. Lekker banken en bedden.<br/>Ik kan echt niets negatiefs verzinnen. (Behalve misschien een hele kleine lift.)"
13831960,267658900,2018-05-22,11579784,Jamila,"Great place! Great location! Great host! We were in Athens for a conference and staying at Spiro’s place was far better than being at the conference hotel. Spiros arranged a taxi for us from the airport (40 euros), and although the flight was an hour late, the driver was so warm and friendly and took us in a nice Mercedes to the apartment with great advice about our week in Greece. Upon our arrival, Spiros and his wife greeted us-even though it was late, and opened up a bottle of chilled wine on the outdoor terrace as they welcomed us to Athens and gave us great tips for food and exploring. The apartment itself was so clean and comfortable. The location of Syntagma square was central to everything! Even found out the metro goes to the beaches of Athens. On our second night there was a street party with 21 DJs just below the apartment. Party scene was loud until about midnight which we enjoyed. There didn’t seem to be other people living in the apartments in the area, mostly businesses, bars, restaurants, and some hotels. On Saturday nights it’s a party scene...such a great time here. Definitely recommend! Thank you Spiros!"
13831960,275478314,2018-06-11,4921674,Carmen Gloria,"Filippo was very nice with me and my sister. He answersd everytime and very soon before and during our staying. He let some details very nice like cooffee, butter, mermelade, shampoos, etc! Thanks a lot!!! ;)<br/>I was dissapointed with the bar downstairs because of the noise, the kitchen was really really basic and not equipped for six people. No washing dishes, oven, spoiler, etc.... And the furniture was very old..."
13831960,277895920,2018-06-17,182605334,Robin,"This apartment was everything that was advertised and more. Filippos came out to meet us at the bus stop and walk us to the apartment,  which was good since it might have otherwise been complicated to explain! He gave us  some excellent advice for seeing the city and we were thrilled that he left breakfast and fruit. The nespresso machine was a great touch.  The location is perfect for exploring the city,  and the balcony just made the stay. Loved it!"

13831960,282313026,2018-06-27,33519696,Mark,"The location of this apartment and the warm nature of the host make this property special. Our host lined up a taxi (van) to bring our group of 5 from the airport. The taxi brought us right to the apartment, and the host was waiting for us outside. He helped us with our luggage, gave us a tour of the apartment and provided good ideas for activities, maps, and suggested places to eat. The apartment is exactly described on the website. We especially enjoyed the outdoor patio - it's great space. In addition to bathroom supplies, the host provided us with fresh cherries, a bottle of wine, Ouzo, coffee and various options for breakfast. We felt very welcome. The host was also very prompt communicating before and during our stay.<br/>The apartment is located about 200 meters from a  central metro stop. We were glad to have taken a taxi to the apartment but once we became familiar with the area, we walked and took the metro to various places around the city.   There are two bathrooms in the apartment, however the second bathroom is upstairs, and a fairly steep set of steps leads to the second bathroom and the washer & dryer.  Accessing the upstairs bathroom was no problem for our group, but may be challenging for anyone with limited mobility. We found the sleeping arrangements very comfortable. This is a great place to stay in the heart of Athens!"
13831960,283071124,2018-06-29,7763772,Bret,"Filippos’ place is fantastic. The location is perfect:  steps to great restaurants, bars, and shopping.  An easy walk leads to most cultural sites. The apartment is charming and comfortable. We had 5 in our party and it easily accommodated all. We especially enjoyed the terrace. It’s a lovely spot for breakfast in the morning and cocktails before heading out in to the Athens nightlife. Filippos was an outstanding host. He met us at the apartment and gave helpful suggestions for restaurants/etc. He even left fresh fruit and toast for breakfast. We will definitely return on our next trip to Greece!  Thanks so much."
13831960,291599096,2018-07-16,15497020,Alex,"Filippos rooftop apartment is an exceptional spot.  The rooms are big and the patio outside is like having a whole other apartment.  There is one bedroom in back near the kitchen, and one connected to the living room that can be fully enclosed for privacy.  A comfortable couch pulls out that can sleep 2 more, though we did not need to use it.  There is a large dining room table, nice bathroom/shower, washer and dryer, coffee machine, good air conditioning and internet.  The internet went out one day, and Filippo had it fixed immediately.  He gave us several recommendations of nearby restaurants that were all good.  The little alley where you enter the apartment has several cute places to eat and have a drink.  In general, it is in a great location.  You can walk to the Acropolis, all of the museums, Syntagma Square, and more shopping, restaurants and bars that you will have time for.  I will return to this place again in the future.  Thank you Filippos!"

13831960,313868422,2018-08-26,30599883,Mashi,"If you’re visit Athens: stay here! I would recommend this airbnb to literally everyone who wants to visit this area. Filippos is so knowledgeable, friendly, communicative, and stylish in his decorating choices. My Mom and I loved our visit and wouldn’t have wanted to stay anywhere else. The balcony was amazing for having a glass of wine at the end of a busy day and the close location to the metro and other tourist destinations made it very convenient and ideal. The area was also safe and full of activities. The next time we come to Athens we will be sure to book again!"
13831960,317978381,2018-09-03,117751180,Øyvind,"Filippos is a great host. The apartment is very central, and the standard is good. The fridge was stocked with cold water and a nice bottle of wine, as well as the regular butter and jams. We had an accident with the washing machine. He was very efficient in solving the problem and very easy to deal with. You can really relax and enjoy this apartment and the host was one of the best I've had so far. You should check it out."

13831960,325243141,2018-09-19,61301692,Geoff,"This apartment has everything going for it.  Clean.  Spacious.  An excellent location close to Syntagma so it's easy to get your bearings (even for people like us, with a poor sense of direction).  The real plus, as other reviews have pointed out, is the balcony.  Great for starting and ending the day.  I can enthusiastically recommend Fillipos' apartment as a great base for your Athens vacation.  Thanks Filippos for everything.  From arranging airport pickup, to the wine and toasts.  An all-round excellent stay."
13831960,328436713,2018-09-26,88986533,Adrian,"Filippos’s place had spacious airy  bedrooms with air conditioning and comfy beds; great position very near to Syntagma Square and public transport; Filippos was very approachable and helpful; the balcony was a great outdoor space too - very spacious.  The kitchen was small but well equipped - we only had breakfast in as there’s loads of restaurants, cafes bistros etc to try out in the city! The position of the accommodation made exploring Athens very easy either on foot or by public transport. Perfect spot Filippos - thank you "
13831960,329498134,2018-09-29,9943915,Krista,"Filippos’ apartment is located in the heart of Athens within walking distance of the Acropolis, Plaka, museums and shopping. Very clean and comfortable with many extra amenities including laundry, beautiful outdoor patio, personal greeting, and help with orientation to the city. He even arranged transport to meet us at the airport. We wished we could have stayed longer and hope to return someday!"
13831960,331640891,2018-10-03,59952042,Karen,"Great communication!  Our plane was late and Filippos  had arranged a driver who was still available and took us right to the door.  The location couldn't be better.  You can walk to most neighborhoods and metro is very close, shopping,  restaurants and bars are on the same block.  We had a great time. Flippos met us at the apartment and reviewed a map of the city with us.  Very nice stay!"
13831960,333261492,2018-10-07,215506029,Judith,"Filippos place was a good choice.  Here are the pros and cons:<br/><br/>Pros: Filippo was a good host. He gave good directions to the taxi driver and met us at the door.  He was also helpful in making sure his friend, the local taxi driver, arrived early on the morning we were leaving.  He also made restaurant recommendations for us and helped with directions.  The location was very good.  The beds were very comfortable.  The local taxi driver is a friend of Filippo and was very friendly and informative.  We did not make use of him upon our arrival, but I wish we had. He was so informative that we would have benefitted from his advice had we had that information upon arrival rather than just on departure.  We highly recommend that you use Filippo's offer to arrange for a driver for you from the airport to the apartment.  The cost is very reasonable.  Just make sure you have cash for the driver, as taxis do not take credit cards.<br/>  <br/>Cons: The pictures were a bit deceiving, as the furniture was covered with drop cloths and not as attractive as in the photos.  Also, it was very difficult taking our showers, since there was no shower head in place so we had to hold the shower hose with one hand while washing with the other.  One other small detail is that there was vey little space for our things in the master bedroom, as the owner had so many things in the drawers and on shelves. <br/><br/>Overall it was a good choice for the price and I would recommend it."
13831960,339226203,2018-10-21,78560143,Sergio,Perfect location. Walking distance from main attractions. Filippos also gave us good tips of what to do and where to eat during our stay. Would definitely go back to his place.

The balcony is spacious and a highlight of the place, if we were not sleeping, we were hanging out there. Filippos is a great host, he helped arrange for airport pickup from a friend of his for only 40, met us right at arrival and gave us good tips on the drive to the apartment. Filippos was waiting for us on the sidewalk as we got dropped off and took us through the apartment and even sat down to give us some good restaurant ideas. One of the places was only a few doors down and had really good seafood. Location is very close to all the sites, nearly all the main tourist sites were less than a 10-15 min walk away. Thank you Filippos!"

È ubicato nel pieno centro di Atene che ti permette di visitare le maggiori attrazioni turistiche a piedi. Oltre ad avere un bellissimo terrazzo, la casa si trova all' ultimo piano lontano da eventuali rumori notturni derivati dalla movida ateniese. Filippos  é un ottimo padrone di casa che  ha fornito tutte le informazioni utili perla visita della città ed indicato un bravo taxista. Unica pecca la presenza di qualche zanzara. Lo consiglio vivamente a tutti.... Grazie Filippos"

Les lits sont de bonne qualités et les serviettes et draps aussi.<br/>La cuisine n est pas très grande et ne permet pas de faire de la grande cuisine mais c est largement compensé par le fait que l’appartement dispose d une salle à manger et d une table sur la terrasse.

From the moment we walked through the door to a lovely warm welcome we loved it, its central  location, arty style, wonderful comfy beds with crisp cotton bedding and most of all the sanctuary of the shady terrace for lovely breakfasts and lazy lunches. You’ll be right in the centre of things, all the main archeological sites, museums and galleries, shops, bars, restaurant you’ll be spoilt for choice. We spent 5 days and walked everywhere and became regulars stopping in every night at ‘The Huge Bar’  (which is tiny) immediately below for a night cap with our favourite barman Santouris.

Wir konnten von hier sowohl die Akropolis als auch die Bars von Exarchia fußläufig erreichen. Vor der Tür gibt es etliche Einkaufsmöglichkeiten vom Markt bis Markenläden. Das Highlight der Wohnung ist die große und sehr gemütliche Terrasse. Die Kommunikation mit Filippos und Check-In waren absolut unkompliziert trotz unserer späten Ankunft. Ich kann die Wohnung auch nur empfehlen.
13831960,527974378,2019-09-12,292188301,Anna,"Fantastic home right in the middle of Athens, great spot, huge balcony, fab amenities! We will be back, thank you Filippos!"
13831960,528987669,2019-09-14,22612367,Valentin,Very nice apartment in good location
13831960,531787530,2019-09-18,254395962,Virginia,"The apartment was exactly as advertised and in a great location in Athens.  The apartment is in an older neighborhood, but decorated very nicely.  Our family loved the spacious balcony where we ate breakfast and enjoyed the cool of the mornings and evenings.  I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Athens.  Filippos provided very helpful communication in advance, recommended places to eat and arranged transportation for us."
13831960,533095127,2019-09-21,54990053,Marietta,"The apertment is very central in Athens and life is fullly around us. You can walk to all the nice places. Fillipos gives nice tipps. The terrace is very big, so we had a lot of place.  Thanks"
13831960,534864817,2019-09-23,10204868,Craig,Great place to stay. Close to all of the great spots.<br/>Filippos was very helpful in helping us to find locations and booking taxis.<br/>Highly recommend to stay
13831960,535755729,2019-09-25,24529628,David,All good
13831960,537695350,2019-09-29,276016542,James,"An attractive, comfortable apartment with character.  Everything in easy walking distance; it's central Athens so don't expect a great view or peace and quiet.  Air- conditioning makes for comfortable sleeping."
13831960,539378725,2019-10-01,71508998,Trudy,This home is amazing!  It is in a fabulous location and only steps away from the metro. The outdoor living space was lovely to sit in to drink our coffee in the morning or unwind in the evening.  The hospitality was outstanding.  Highly recommend this home!
13831960,543131790,2019-10-07,16961894,Maria,"Die Wohnung von Filippos hat eine tolle Lage, da die meisten Sehenswürdigkeiten mit einem Spaziergang zu Fuß erreichbar sind. Die Metro-Station Syntagma Platz ist direkt um die Ecke. Die Wohnung selbst ist hübsch mit verspielten Möbeln im älteren Stil eingerichtet und ein Highlight ist der riesige Tresor im Wohnzimmer. Es gibt sowohl zwei Schlafzimmer als auch zwei Badezimmer (das zweite haben wir allerdings erst recht spät entdeckt, da es im Obergeschoss versteckt war). Die Wohnung ist vollständig ausgestattet, allerdings haben wir dort nie selbst gekocht. Unglaublich ist die große Terrasse, auf die man sich an lauen Abenden entspannt mit einem Glas Wein setzen kann. Ebenfalls gleich um die Ecke sind einige tolle Bars (die feiernden Menschen hört man auch auf der Terrasse, was uns aber nicht weiter gestört hat). Wir buchen die Wohnung bei unserem nächsten Besuch auf jeden Fall wieder - super Preis-Leistungsverhältnis!"
13831960,546868151,2019-10-14,104446464,Jeremy,"Filippos is a very good host.  He allowed us early baggage drop off, and was alway prompt with communication. He also provided local tips/recommendations.  His apartment is very clean and spacious and has lots of character with thoughtful decor. The kitchen is quite small and basic, but if you’re like us and mostly eating out then it’s not an issue.  In the shower you need to hold the water outlet, ie there no mount to fasten it in on the wall.....not a big deal, just something to note. The balcony is large and a great place to relax.  The location is very close to all the big attractions, say 15mins walk to most.  The bus to/from the airport is only 5 mins walk away, and takes a little over an hour in either direction. If you want to use the clothes washer ask Filippos for the instructions.  Happy to recommend this apartment to other travellers."

13831960,566396263,2019-11-19,29682788,Manuel,"El apartamento de Filippos cumple con lo que ofrece. Situación inmejorable y una terraza fantástica. Filippos, un hombre encantador  y facilitador. Lo pasamos muy bien.<br/>Si hay que señalar algo negativo, es que una sola llave para cuatro personas es insuficiente.<br/>Más  aún  si el timbre del portal no funciona. Pero eso son pequeñeces<br/><br/>The Filippos apartment complies with what it offers. Unbeatable location and a fantastic terrace. Filippos, a charming and facilitating man. Really enjoyed it.<br/>If you have to point out something negative, it is that a single key for four people is insufficient.<br/>Even more if the portal doorbell does not work. But that is small"
13831960,570799963,2019-11-30,119109580,Csilla,It is a perfect place to explore the city from. You do not need a bus pass as you can walk to all major sights from here and there are lots of nice eating places nearby. Filippos always answered quickly to any messages and he was very accommodating.

Located in the heart of Athens, within walking distance of major tourist attractions and close to many bars and restaurants, with a generous rooftop terrace! Very conveniently located for the nightlife of Athens, within walking distance from Plaka, but still away from the noise of bars and clubs! Also, good communication with the owner! Recommended!! "

The location can't be any better and the apartment is beautifully decorated, very well stocked with supplies that make it feel like home, clean and comfortable. The best part is the balcony - which always has a breeze and is perfectly situated to never be in the sun except for the shortest time in the afternoon.   Filippos, Vasiliki and Helen are all super helpful and communicative. We feel very lucky to have been guests in this lovely home."

13835153,98680712,2016-09-01,2673097,Anna,This is a really beautiful appartment right by the Acropolis. Lydia was very friendly and welcoming. Kitchen and bathroom are fantastic. Perhaps an iron would be helpful. I definitely recommend the place to everybody.I
13835153,103977212,2016-09-25,23124052,Alexander,One of the best possible stay in Athens. In a historical house with a tiny garden in the upper Plaka on slope of the Acropolis hill in an absolutely quiet and beautiful old street a few minutes walk from metro station. It’s like staying at home of a European intellectual with stylish furniture and many books. Walking distance to everything  interesting in old Athens. Stable and fast wi-fi connection. intelligent and friendly Lydia or her nice assistants arrange everything you need. I recommend it sincerely.
13835153,109706381,2016-10-23,59739170,Jivan,"Lydia and Alex were great hosts. they welcomed us even though we landed late in Athens, bought us food, offered advise  and responded quickly to any queries. The house is lovely and location perfect for visiting all the sites and has some great food places just a few minutes away. Would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again."
13835153,124944652,2017-01-03,58557340,Alex,Great place in the shadow of the Acropolis - really cosy space with lots of wonderful history books! A great place to explore both ancient and modern Athens
13835153,130055532,2017-02-04,4487530,Louis,"It's an absolutely marvelous place, styled, full of books, paintings and beautiful objects, comfortable, quiet, very well equipped, perfectly clean, and Lydia called in advance to make the arrival very easy. It's fantastic location at the foot of the Acropolis and at the heart of the old Plaka quarter is exceptional. It has a lot of charm."

The house feels steeped in history, and with all the books, we could easily research further what we learned during our daily explorations. It was a fine mix of authentic Greek home and creature comfort. A real find!"
13835153,154529955,2017-05-25,116264213,Ramon,"La casa es tal cual como se ve en las fotos, muy bien ubicada, fresca en los dias de calor y muy acogedora, fuimos con mi familia por cuatro dias y nos hubiera gustado quedarnos mas, super recomendable!!"
13835153,155567893,2017-05-28,109179806,Lynn,Alex and Lydia were very warm and helpful! I choose this home to experience the history of Athens and was not disappointed. Directly behind the house is the Acropolis...a 5 minute walk and your at the ticket counter. 
13835153,165592161,2017-07-01,99548916,Graciosita,"Good location! Nice place, a little noisy by the neighboor in the night with the TV.<br/>A little difficult communicate with the person who is in charge of the Apt. but he was very nice when we catch the keys after impossible to communicate. Different phone numbers, we took the wrong taxi to Pireus reservated by him and impossible communicate! We almost lost the boat, but finnaly we arrived."
13835153,183051065,2017-08-16,98676996,Claire,The house isvery cosy and perfectly located. Our arrival and departure was well managed by Lydia.
13835153,199541825,2017-10-02,23124052,Alexander,"The best possible place in Athens inside Plaka just on the Acropolis slope, quiet place, historical house in a perfect condition with a tiny garden and stylish old but perfectly restored furniture, books etc run by an educated Greek-English family. The hosts living in the next door house (so no difficulties of communications) help with any explanation, call taxi if needed and are  very pleasant people to talk to about everything. Just don't imagine a better stay."
13835153,244677856,2018-03-19,32952308,Sabrina,"Petite maison adorable idéalement située entre acropole et vieille ville. Propreté impeccable. Quelques bémols cependant: Lydia ne nous a ni accueillis ni même salués alors qu’elle vit dans la maison mitoyenne, une des 2 chambres était fermée et occupée par une personne extrêmement bruyante, ce qui nous laissait une chambre avec un lit de 120... <br/>Je recommande cette maison pleine de charme."
13835153,431534144,2019-04-01,27101903,Richard,We loved our stay at Lydia's house the check in was so friendly and helpful and informative. A most comfortable place to stay and plenty of restaurants within 2 minutes walk. We would definitely return to Lydia's. Thank you also for the lovely bowl of fruit that was left for us. Richard and Helene
13835153,479523931,2019-07-01,38597029,Angela,"An adorable house in the perfect location!  Open the door and head down cafe-lined steps into the heart of The Plaka. Or walk up and arrive at the Acropolis in 5 minutes. Perfect house for our family. Very spacious living room, very homey. Beds were so comfortable. Thanks for perfect stay!"
13837989,102750104,2016-09-19,16568028,Céline,"Nous avons été accueillis par Yiannis à notre arrivée. Nous avons pu rencontrer Katerina le lendemain qui nous a donné de très bons conseils pour notre court séjour. 
<br/>Leur accueil était remarquable, leur gentillesse était permanente, nous pouvions les appeler à tout moment, le frigo était même garni avec du vin, des olives et des fruits.
<br/>Le studio est très fonctionnel et propre, le lit est grand et confortable et il y a même une climatisation pour les fortes chaleurs (idéal en été).
<br/>Il est situé idéalement à proximité de la station de métro Acropole.

Το συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα."
13837989,239069720,2018-02-28,84488207,Francine,The apartment it's like in the pictures and have the most amazing location near all the important historical monuments you can do everything walking but it has also a subway station at less than 5 minutes from the apartment. Katerina it's an amazing person and an excellent hostess!
13837989,246272890,2018-03-25,127032849,Wiesław,This flat is comfortable and well located. The Hosts are nice and helpful. I recommend this plsce. Wieslaw.

13837989,254602860,2018-04-17,48304797,Nopamon Thevit,"The apartment was lovely and clean and centrally located near the Acropolis and Plaka area. We could walk to most attractions from the apartment. The space was just right for 1-2 people. The bed was also very comfortable, so the place was a cozy place to spend nights in Athens, highly recommended! Check-in was convenient even though we arrived a bit later than planned."
13837989,256098370,2018-04-22,43503846,Ziv,It was a pleasure to stay at Yianni's apartment. We really enjoyed the good location - short distance to Acropolis entrance and highly recommended restaurants.<br/><br/>Our vacation in Athens was a dream and alot thanks to staying at this apartment.
13837989,257152150,2018-04-25,60086373,Julia,"This apartment is steps away from centrally locally Acropolis metro station and in the heart of the quaint and picturesque Plaka neighbourhood. Perfect for one or two people. Paris was an efficient contact, who responded very quickly to my questions or messages. He checked in with me to see how everything was going, which was a nice touch. The apartment was comfortable and just what I needed for my two day stay."
13837989,260012151,2018-05-03,159307254,Daniel,Ubicación exelente. Todo funcionando bien. Departamento muy agradable y con balcón. Muy recomendable !!!
13837989,260805522,2018-05-05,10394648,Adelaide,"This place is absolutely wonderful. The location is the best part - right in the heart of Plaka, next to Anafiotika and Monastiraki, which is where you find the white washed villas, marble streets, hidden alley ways, as well as the fact that it's right next to the Acropolis. We were only here for a short stay but Yiannis & Paris were great hosts - they had someone waiting for us to check in (even though we were an hour late) and they helped us to find somewhere to store our bags when our check out time didn't match with our next part of the trip. The room itself is quiet, easy entry with an elevator. AC. The shower was a bit surprising as it's actually a bath with a shower hose, so you have to hold the hose up if you want to use it but we didn't have any problem with that. Would definitely stay there again - great value for money."
13837989,263090621,2018-05-11,112448009,Meredith,Great location and value for the price. We loved being so close to restaurants and the Acropolis.
13837989,263867032,2018-05-13,22105772,Glenn,"We would like to thank Paris and his team for being such great hosts and so responsive with their communication to ensure that we arrive at his place safely. Also, they were able to quickly adjust according to our schedule when we were slightly delayed when coming over from the airport.<br/><br/>Excellent location, within short walking distance to major sites such as Akropolis, Plaka, Olympic Stadium etc. Highly recommend this unit and you will enjoy your stay here!"
13837989,265156627,2018-05-16,165828296,Matthew,"This Apartment is perfect for exploring all of the ancient sites while in Athens .. it is steps away from the Acropolis Museum and pretty much every one of the site in the area. The Apartment is great for an afternoon nap between outings, and is realatively quiet considering it is in the heart of the city. The amenities cover everything you can need, if you wanted to cook you absolutely can but, I would suggest against it as there are plenty of amazing places just steps away. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cost safe spot to set up during an Athens excursion."
13837989,266506515,2018-05-20,22582547,Jen,"Had a great time at Yiannis’s place! The location was fantastic, walkable to lots of great restaurants and sights. Enjoyed the balcony and the neighborhood — can’t beat the short walk to the Acropolis!"

13837989,272254370,2018-06-03,144860172,Kathleen,The amazing location of this apartment can not be overstated. You are maybe 100 ft from the southeast entrance to the Acropolis with equally near access to the metro. The dining and shopping of Plaka surrounds the area. The apartment was perfectly clean and check in was flexible. Building is very secure. Having air conditioning was a life saver during the heat wave. This is a really great place to stay.
13837989,273696214,2018-06-07,7035109,John,"The flat is spacious and amazing with all it's amenities. The location is great as it is at a walking distance from Plaka, Acropolis and the metro station. Our host was just a call away from helping us. Me and my wife really enjoyed our stay here."
13837989,276541591,2018-06-14,25475473,Miles,Yiannis & Paris' place is excellent. It's location could not be better in the middle of Athens and a minute walk to the metro. It's a nice studio in a very safe neighborhood and has all the amenities listed. Would definitely stay here again.
13837989,279550394,2018-06-21,38589068,Romain,"This appartment is very well situated, 200m from the akropolis station, the akropolis museum and the akropolis. The appartment is very cosy, clean with the main equipements"
13837989,281658997,2018-06-25,44331413,Liezl,"We had a wonderful time staying with Yiannis and Paris. The location is perfect for visits to the Acropolis and just perfect to see the best of Athens, not far from the Plaka. Paris was also very helpful with where to go for food. The flat was clean and had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. Highly recommended."
13837989,283488111,2018-06-30,26148853,Natascha & Brian,The apartment is centrally located and close to lots of restaurants. The check in process was really simple and Paris provided helpful instructions before we arrived.
13837989,285180362,2018-07-03,125191850,Allie,"The location is perfect! You walk out the door and turn right and the Acropolis path, bars and restaurants, and entertainment is right there. I was alone for part of my time there and felt very safe as well. It was a great price, especially for where it is. I would highly recommend this spot. "
13837989,287536435,2018-07-08,11612749,Victor,"Incredible location, close to everything. Check out was at 10am which was understandable as there were new people coming in that day at 2. However, it would have been nice if we could have left our luggage there until 12. We asked Yiannis but he could not accommodate, and instead proposed a storage place where we had to walk to and pay. This is the only reason we gave four stars instead of five. Overall we highly recommend his studio. Clean and close to everything! Athens is an incredible city. We wish we could have stayed one more day. Thank you Yiannis for such an amazing experience!"
13837989,289346246,2018-07-12,32183653,Seren,"SUCH a great location! Maybe 8 minutes walk to the entrance of the Acropolis and five to the Acropoli station, which also means it’s close to shops, beautiful buildings, bars and restaurants etc. We also walked to the larger shopping district in 15-20 minutes one day. The appartment feels secure and the kitchen makes it very homely and easy to live in. The bed is comfortable and the desk is actually a great touch for all the bookings we had to do. Paris was such a good host, very responsive and patient with my silly questions. Would certainly stay again."

13837989,321372265,2018-09-10,67539626,Tim,"A stylish and comfortable studio in a great location. A short distance from the Parthenon and other sites, this is a perfect place from which to explore this wonderful city. Highly recommended."
13837989,322503909,2018-09-13,65634360,Stella,Excellent location. Clean. Perfect for a few days in Athens
13837989,328069315,2018-09-25,142033451,Michael,"Great place. You are literally in Athens center. Near the metro, tours, the Acropolis, and many places to get food.<br/><br/>It’s a good deal, and we felt very safe the entire stay. The instructions were easy to follow, do remember the breaker panel to turn the hot water on and off.<br/><br/>Here is my only complaint: there is a door on the far side of the room with a random stool in front of it, and a broken dead bolt. We figured it was a closet, only to open it and find out it was to someone else’s apartment. During our entire stay, it was a little unnerving to know the neighbor in the other apartment could just walk into our room if they so pleased. <br/><br/>I’m sure Yiannis knows this person, and I’m sure it was nothing to be worried about, but there was no mention of it upon our booking or in the instructions. <br/><br/>Perhaps a suggestion would be to fix the dead bolt to that other room.<br/><br/>Other than that you really can’t go wrong with the place. This small issue didn’t affect my rating."

Ideal for couples. <br/>The only inconvenience for us was the bathroom. It doesn’t have a standing shower or a shower curtain, so better for people that prefer having baths over showers."

Proprietários muito resolutivos em providenciar o táxi do aeroporto o que nos facilitou muito o self check in, principalmente porque chegamos em Atenas de madrugada. Espaço amplo. Bem limpo. Cama e travesseiros bons. Silencioso. Recomendamos!"

13837989,460037385,2019-05-28,90498076,Bruce,"This is a great location right among Hadrian's Gate, Zeus's Temple, the Acropolis Museum, and the southeast gate to the Acropolis. And the Akropoli metro stop is right there too. It is all in walking distance, including many restaurants and shops.<br/><br/>We found the apartment to be large, clean, quiet and comfortable. Since the key box and apartment are a bit far apart (one metro stop), it helps to have a map. We walked from the Keyper to the apartment without difficulty, but it might be a bit more difficult after dark. By the way, the Metro proved to be the best way to get around Athens. It was clean, frequent and safe. Also the best way in from the airport. Only one transfer to get to this apartment.<br/><br/>This proved to be a great base of operations for experiencing Athens' extensive history."
13837989,461166954,2019-05-31,31180188,Brittany,"Perfect flat with easy access to Acropolis, Plaka, restaurants, metro, walks through the park, etc. very clean, comfy bed and cool building. Would stay here again."
13837989,463922591,2019-06-04,148990323,Maria,"Pros <br/>The location of this place is very central. It was close to a lot of good places which was very convenient for us foodies. Also it was very close (2 minute walk) to the Acropolis entrance and Acropolis Museum Location. It is also close to a train station even though we did not use public transportation. There is an elevator in building which was very convenient. The area was filled with tourists (in a good way) and it was central to shops. The atmosphere was very lively and pleasant to stay in. It definitely was worth the money, however, there were cons to this Airbnb as well. <br/><br/>Cons <br/>Key directions were not accurate. We had landed at 10pm and took a cab to find the key area. The taxi driver could not figure out the location as well and we spent 15 minutes looking for the key store (while the meter was running which costed us more money). When we called the host for help, he didn’t respond until the next day. We would recommend asking the host the exact address in Greek and English before arrival. <br/><br/>Some other inconvenient things were having to take out our own garbage that was listed as just outside the building but was actually a block down (we found out after asking multiple store owners). We were also given only one and half rolls of toilet paper which we ran out of and the instruction in the apartment state to contact the host for extras but when we did, we were informed that what we were given was for the entire stay. We had to purchase our own toilet paper lol! The same goes for fresh towels, we wanted more towels and requested more as per the instructions sheet at the apartment but once we contacted the host, we were once again informed that we won’t be getting any extras. <br/><br/>Another small inconvenience was that the the plumbing system is old and you cannot flush toilet paper down the toilet. We were surprised to read that as it was not mentioned on the listing. <br/><br/>We would also like to point out that the host replies days later which was frustrating at times!"
13837989,464716948,2019-06-06,23847889,Olivia,"We had a wonderful stay in Yiannis’s place! The apartment is very spacious, comfortable and perfectly located for visiting the Acropolis and exploring the old town of Plaka.

Clean and comfortable apartment. The only negative was a power out in that neighborhood which shut off WiFi, ac, and elevator. These things happen. I want to stay here again."
13837989,479569401,2019-07-01,112399222,Sheryl Mae,"Pros: The place is really close to the tourist area (Acropolis, Zeus Temple etc).<br/><br/>Cons: Host is slow in replying, not very helpful (will tell you to check (Hidden by Airbnb) maps instead), not accommodating.  Keys need to be collected from a different place."

It was a short walk to get to less touristy parts of town, easy to get out to the beach, and very very easy to pop out and get anything I wanted or needed at the nearby shops and restaurants. Highly recommend!"

13837989,527082417,2019-09-10,185936567,Sima,At the  beginning we had a negative experience with the check-in. We didn't find the keys with the tag  as instructed.  We needed a double trip to the store and back to find out what are the correct keys from the apartment. <br/><br/>Otherwise the apartment is in  excellent location and Host is very quick to respond. We enjoyed our vacation.  Thank you Yainnis.

13837989,540889199,2019-10-04,48163042,Uljana,"The airbnb is located in the perfect spot in Plaka. Check in and communication in general was easy and quick. Unfortunately it was not as lovely as expected from the pictures. We stayed 6 nights and had to ask several times for fresh towels. The answers were sometimes not that polite. Also there were no extra sheets or cover for the bed blanket, which is fine when you travel with your partner but not that cool when travelling with a friend. As long as you only use this place for sleeping for a short Athens stay, it's perfect. For several days I would rather book something else."
13837989,544012862,2019-10-09,4158970,Heather,"Flat with everything you need, way closer to everything than we expected. 1 minute walk to acropolis and acropolis museum. Very walkable and safe during usual hours with lots of restaurants and shops very close by that are open late. Bed and pillows were a bit firm for me, but I’m a sensitive sleeper. AC was really appreciated during hot days of our visit. We did find the location quite noisy, both with street noise and noise from nearby suites/the hallway, but earplugs I brought along did the job. Make sure to read the info sheet when arriving as we forgot to do so and it points out crucial items, such as water heating and where to locate certain items. All in all a good 5 nights stay, and we would consider this location again in the future as it was a fantastic value given the location and amenities."
13837989,557557020,2019-11-01,123079390,Paul,Simple but comfortably equipped. Very convenient location near to Acropoli Metro station and walking distance to all attractions.

Pillows were really flat which my husband liked and I did not. It's a cozy studio that great if you want to be out sound the city all the time. People are very friendly in this area! Cons are the place is pretty Ioud with neighbors coming in and out and the street noise at night. Check in was a little disastrous as we couldn't find the key lock box which is at another location nearby. The host did apologize for being without service during check in but a local was kind enough to kind the key after some investigation. <br/>The host was great with anything you could need or questions you may have. I would stay for 2 nights again,  but would choose another location for a longer stay."

<br/>The cake and sweets that were left for me were a pleasant surprise and the teas and local Greek coffee only added to this home from home.

<br/>I got amazing advice on where to go and upon my time to leave was taken all the way to the bus station.

13842245,86631561,2016-07-17,38387634,Alessandra,"Lito è stata un host eccezionale, già dalla prenotazione si è dimostrata interessata a rendere perfetta la nostra esperienza. Il giorno dell'arrivo ci siamo sentite telefonicamente e ci ha fornito tutte le indicazioni per raggiungere nel modo migliore il punto di incontro. Per agevolare la nostra permanenza ci ha fatto parcheggiare la macchina nel quartiere Mets dove abita con il fidanzato, anche lui gentilissimo, proprio sotto casa garantendoci così un po' di sicurezza. Prima di portarci nel suo appartamento, nel bellissimo quartiere pedonale di Plaka, ci ha accolti a casa sua come se fossimo vecchi amici, caffè, pasticcini, bibite. Insieme al fidanzato Yiannis ci hanno dato preziosissimi consigli su dove andare, cosa fare e dove mangiare. Poi con la sua macchina ci ha accompagnati all'appartamento. L'appartamento è esattamente come nelle foto, delizioso, profumato, pulito, accogliente, tutto curato nel dettaglio e la sua posizione è a dir poco strategica. Anche lì Lito aveva preparato per noi un dolce per la colazione, caffè, acqua fresca e dolcetti tipici. Durante la  permanenza lei e il fidanzato si sono sempre interessati a noi e ai nostri spostamenti. Le loro indicazioni ci hanno permesso di scoprire anche zone meno note della città ma sicuramente altrettanto belle e di mangiare sempre tra gli ateniesi. Al momento della partenza, di domenica, ci ha nuovamente accolto a casa sua preparandoci una gustosa colazione. Ci sembrava di essere a casa di persone conosciute da sempre, abbiamo parlato di tanti argomenti, politica, lavoro, viaggi e al momento della partenza ci hanno dato tante informazioni su come proseguire al meglio il nostro viaggio. Lito è un host perfetta, una persona dolce, calorosa e gentile, la sua e quella del fidanzato è stata un'accoglienza super che si riserva agli amici più cari. Grazie Lito e Yiannis di aver reso ancora più bella la nostra permanenza ad Atene."

My partner and I were greeted by them at the metro station, they made an effort to explain to us what is good in the neighborhood with some very useful recommendations of what to see and eat in Athens. The flat looks like what is described in the pictures. Lito's flat was incredibly cozy and we felt at home. Basic cooking supplies and utensils were provided. If I were to return to Athens, I will surely choose Lito's flat again. Would definitely recommend Plaka's Heart to those who want to visit Athens as the flat is centrally located with the Acropolis within walking distance. "

<br/>La cocina está muy bien equipada con café, azúcar, té, vasos, platos, etc y así todo el piso.
<br/>El barrio de Plaka está en la falda del Acrópolis, lleno de vida, de comercios, de bares, pero todo en un ambiente tranquilo y familiar.
<br/>
<br/>Nos gustó mucho que nos recibiera con un pastel típido de Grecia, desde el primer momento quedamos encantados con ellas y si volviésemos a Atenas, repetiriamos con este airbnb.

<br/>Muchas gracias por todo, por preocuparos por nosotros en todo momento y por ese piso bonito que tenéis.

When we arrived, they were already there and it was no issue that we arrived a little bit earlier than we expected. She was very nice and had great recommendations for a lovely walk and many great restaurants. You should definitely check out the small family taverns she recommends - we always eat great and for very fair prices. The place itself is supernice as well. We felt at home and it's really cosy. Even though the flat is not very large, everything fits in quite good and there was still enough space for our bags and clothes. It has been renovated not so long ago and the place is very central. Overall, we definitely had a great time and enjoyed our stay. Would recommend staying at Plaka's heArt for sure!"

13842245,114140608,2016-11-15,2775093,Claire,"Plaka's heArt was such an excellent place to stay for a few days in Athens. The location is absolutely perfect!  Very close walking distance to all the shops, restaurants and sights but not at all noisy. The flat was very clean and well thought out with some really nice touches that you don't always get in airbnb's (like shampoo, shower gel, tea, coffee, homemade snacks and helpful little notes everywhere). You can tell that Lito and Yiannis really care about making it a welcoming place to stay for guests. One of the nicest things was being greeted by Yiannis on arrival. He explained how everything worked and showed us some info that they have written especially for guests to help people know the best places to go and how to get around the city like a local :-) <br/>There was great communication the whole time in the run up to our booking. I would definitely stay again but the only suggestion I would make is that it might be nice to have a rug or two on the floor for winter. We visited in November so the weather was a bit colder that usual, this meant that the stone floor made us feel cold whenever we walked on it without shoes. If I visited again that time of year I would take slippers! Haha - but it certainly wasn't a big problem. <br/>Overall, a great long weekend. Thank you! ♡"

She even got on the phone to talk to our taxi driver so that they could coordinate meeting points. The flat itself is very cozy and clean with amenities (shower gel, shampoo, coffee etc). Lito also left us a very useful walking guide that laid out everything that we could see related to the famous sites around Athens. We use it and found that we got a great experience enjoying Athens. The guide also provided nearby restaurants, street food, and cafes.  Overall, Lito was an amazing host and always there to help us if we had any questions or needed suggestions. 1000% would stay at her place again. "

The apartment is not too big, but very nicely organized. Location couldn't be better. Only complaint is that thicker curtains could stop light from entering in the morning, but it's really minor. This is a real gem."

The flat was very clean and well-stocked (they even left home-made cookies). They also had printouts of places they suggest to visit and eat, which I highly recommend!

They gave us all the information we needed before and during our stay and were always reachable over (Hidden by Airbnb) . The flat is cozy and beautifully decorated and equipped with all you need (e.g. wifi coffee, small Greek snacks, cooking utensils...) and has a very comfortable bed. It lies in a quite side street of the central town. So it's close to everything. The only thing 'negative' is, that the flat is heated and cooled only with AC, that needs to be switched off, when you leave the house. So in Winter it can be a little cold when you come home. I guess spring to fall it's great because I think it doesn't get that hot."

13842245,158497111,2017-06-07,110171354,Елена,"Мы были в квартире Лито в начале июня. Она оснащена всем необходимым для приготовления не только легкого завтрака, но и чего-либо посущественнее. Есть кондиционер, wi-fi, горячая вода нагревается в бойлерах. Комнаты интересно оформлены и за счет цветов на окне совсем не чувствуется, что живешь на первом этаже. Нас вовремя встретили, квартира находится очень удобно по отношению ко всем достопримечательностям. Большое спасибо!"
13842245,159136198,2017-06-10,85936932,Mike,Plaka's Heart is in a great location within Athens. Lito was very hospitable upon arrival and had many comforts for our stay there. We would definitely stay here again as it was very clean and enjoyable. 
13842245,160178271,2017-06-13,13964281,Alice,"We were welcomed by Lito with her 'mumma's biscuits' after very receiving very useful directions about how to get there by bus from the airport, which was very easy. The space is very clean and comfortable for 3. It's within easy walking distance of all the main attractions in Athens and very nice restaurants and cafes. Couldn't recommend this place more (and the free walking tour of Athens which leaves from Hadrians's gate at 9.45am and is a 2 min walk). "
13842245,161157473,2017-06-17,5148950,Sanne,"Lovely little apartment, full of thoughtful details and a warm welcome. Quiet street in lively plaka, everything walking distance. Highly recommended "

13842245,162978452,2017-06-23,28281744,Sunny,Everything was as described! I had a little trouble finding the flat but once I did Lito was there waiting for me! She showed me around and told me how to work everything. Very close to all the major sights and about a 10 min walk to the bus x95 to and from the airport. Had cookies waiting and plenty of coffee and sugar for my morning coffee. I would stay here again and recommend this flat to anyone looking to stay in plaka. 
13842245,163522719,2017-06-25,36477107,Caitlyn,"We loved staying at Lito's place! Very central to the Acropolis and nearby restaurants. Easy to walk around, quiet, and convenient.  Would highly recommend for solo travelers or in a couple. Would definitely stay there again! "

13842245,165771354,2017-07-02,83461251,Myriam,"This little flat was beautifully kept and decorated. Lito was extremely kind to us, very approachable and friendly. She was very keen to make our stay as comfortable and pleasant as possible. She left us home made cookies and brought us an iron which we needed for a wedding. The house was very clean and cosy with all the essentials and very nicely decorated. The location was absolutely great, in walking distance to almost all impressive monuments! Great stay, definitely a place I'd recommend. We'll definitely be back!"
13842245,166611525,2017-07-04,10493043,Chloe,Beautiful place! So tasteful with beautiful photos and lighting. Great location. Would stay again.

The accommodation was clean and comfortable, with all that we needed for our stay. Lito and Nikos were very accommodating, going above and beyond our expectations. Nikos met us on arrival and showed us the apartments facilities. Lito was even kind enough to provide me with the details of a local dentist, due to a dental emergency! Thank you for a wonderful stay. If you're considering a visit to Athens, we highly recommend Plaka's heArt! "
13842245,169030254,2017-07-11,33064607,Mary,"Lito was an excellent host. She is exceptional to communicate with - answers promptly and kept me well informed. She gave excellent instructions about options for getting to the apartment from the airport. The apartment is in the BEST location - right in the Plaka close to the bus & metro. The markets and acropolis were right next to the apartment. Many many wonderful restaurants to eat and lots of shopping. The apartment was spotlessly clean and more than comfortable in size for 2-3 people. Aircon & wifi excellent. Anything extra you need would be available if you ask. Bed was very comfortable. Lito even had staples such as oil sugar tea coffee and welcoming Greek biscuits available. The only down side was there was no laundry, but for a short stay that isn't a big problem. Nikos was fantastic - my sister arrived a day early and he even met her at the station at close to 11:00pm. <br/>I would highly recommend this accommodation as you are right in the heart of everything - the perfect location and Lito is the perfect host. "
13842245,169842421,2017-07-14,111611441,Edouard,Lito s'est montré très serviable et disponible durant notre voyage; il s'est assuré que tout allait bien. Le lieu est idéalement situé pour visiter Athènes. 
13842245,171210412,2017-07-17,119022993,Alison,"Lito's place was perfect for our short but sweet stay in Athens. The place was as described and well-appointed. The location was great - near to the busy and fun streets in Plaka, but tucked away so that it was quiet at night. We loved it! They were very helpful with tips on where to eat and even arranged a taxi for us to Piraeus port."

13842245,178221824,2017-08-05,7937068,Sarah,"This is a great place to stay in Athens. The location is perfect - in the middle of Plaka but on a quiet street. The apartment itself is simple and clean, a good size for two people. The best part of this apartment is Lito - she met us at the apartment when we checked in to make sure we were all set up in the apartment, provided recommendations for nearby restaurants and activities, had lots of information on hand about transportation and other logistics, and even kept the kitchen stocked with basic supplies like coffee and sugar. I definitely recommend staying here!"
13842245,179637690,2017-08-08,70142083,Dave,"Lito and Yiannis are incredibly kind and helpful, just wonderful people! They gave great directions to get there and were there to greet me.  They also have great suggestions of places to visit with maps and details about each place. They also gave restaurant recommendations that were fantastic and off the beaten path. The apartment is perfect - right in the center of Plaka, which is a great neighborhood with cafes, restaurants, pedestrian walkways, little shops, and only a few blocks to the Acropolis, a beautiful Acropolis Museum, and many other great sites. It was exactly what I had hoped for! Thank you Lito and Yiannis for helping to make my experience in Athens so perfect!!! I highly recommend it!!!"
13842245,180378610,2017-08-10,53136705,Andrea,"The appartment is very well located near restaurants, shops and the Acropolis. Lito was very kind helping us book a taxi and offering really good suggestions todo explore the city. She was waiting us with some homemade cookies and sweets :) Very nice place to stay!"
13842245,181080397,2017-08-12,17058587,Ken,"My requirements: Old day house with modern creature comfort. Away from tourist crowd. Walking distance to food and Acropolis and Museum. Simple cooking when laziness sets in. Fridge to chill beer and wine. Near to market for groceries. No extra frills that I do not need (swimming pool, reception etc)<br/><br/>Verdict: All above met<br/><br/>Check in/ Check out: Simple. Direct. Some walk if you have luggage. We requested for suggestion for airport transfer. They gave detailed explanation and we chosed the public bus from Airport to Syntagma Sq (from there 8 minutes walk to Airbnb unit). We chose the bus station cause its exactly outside the Athens Airport arrival hall, then we alight at the last stop.<br/><br/>Location: Near to Acropolis, Acropolis Museum, Street food and Bretto! (the nicest oldest distillery in Athens). We walked to everywhere without any public transport.<br/><br/>The House: All creature comfort included in high quality. Comfy king size bed, Aircon, hot water and shower, fridge, an extra bed that can cater for 3rd person. But we use it as day bed since we only had 2. Big place enough for 3 adult although we were only 2 person. Secure building with safe deposit like doors. Safe area just a street parallel to popular tourist street for the occasional easy food or drink but quiet enough to sleep in to rest the tired feet. Ouh btw, Lito was kind enough to provide home made local cookies, we ate all of them. Yumzzz<br/><br/>Fantastic homie and kitchen design. A nice place to get refreshed and chill out."
13842245,182546663,2017-08-15,37914990,Carla,"A cozy apartment really well located in the heart of Plaka. 5 min walking to the Acropolis, in the district of Plaka. Quite, clean and with an friendly host, Lito. She explained us the city, and recommended so many places to visit as well as to eat well and local food. No doubt, if we come back to Athens, we will do it in Lito's flat. Thank you so much!!"
13842245,183683613,2017-08-18,49846130,Alejandro,"Muy buen piso, fantástico Lito"
13842245,185157595,2017-08-21,61903688,Jonathan,Lito did everything possible for us. Her apartment is spotless and there is so much effort put in for her guests. There were lots of notes and recommendations for us to follow. Super Location and loved every moment of it. Highly recommend.

13842245,186907108,2017-08-26,61963940,Brooke,"Lito's flat in the heart of Plaka was more lovely than we even expected! It is pleasing to the eye, roomy, and very comfortable. The location could not be beat!!! We were in the heart of Athens and were able to walk to all major attractions, restaurants, bars etc. Lito was out of town on vacation when we arrived but his assistant met us at the flat and the check in was a breeze. Lito even left us authentic greek treats and bottled water. The flat itself is adorable. It is on the ground floor so that was a relief since we had heavy luggage. We loved all of the details throughout the flat, plus the bed is very soft, and the A/C and wifi worked great. We would highly recommend Lito's flat to anyone looking for a very convenient and affordable place to stay in Athens. We felt spoiled the whole time we were there! Thank you again Lito!!"
13842245,188347822,2017-08-29,12056577,Jordan,Great place to stay! Lito was out of town when we stayed but his friend Nikos filled in perfectly and was very helpful and communicative.
13842245,189476133,2017-09-02,20635724,Danielle,"Lito's friend Niko met us at the apartment as Lito was away on holidays during our visit. Lito was in contact to let us know this a few weeks earlier and gave us plenty of information for how to get to the apartment from the airport which we really appreciated. Communication was easy and the replies to any questions we had were really quick. <br/><br/>The apartment is in the most perfect location, we were able to walk everywhere and it is surrounded by great restaurants. It is so close to everything, however it's in a little side street so isn't noisy and doesn't have a lot of foot traffic going past. The apartment is clean and has everything we needed for a comfortable stay. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Athens!"
13842245,191268345,2017-09-07,43883743,Courtney,"Lito and her flat were beyond words amazing! She and her boyfriend make you feel like family from the moment you meet them, offering homemade cookies and sweets. Their flat was at THE BEST location, and was the perfect quiet and peaceful retreat from the bustle of Athens (which after a long day of sight seeing is much needed). You will not find a better place, value, hosts, or experience than Plaka's heart and we hope to be back soon!"

The roads in the area can be confusing, but the directions we received to the apartment were very clear. And the check in process was friendly and thorough. The apartment was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. We also appreciated the bonus of cookies and welcome information provided. I would definitely recommend this apartment for anyone visiting Athens for a few days."

Easy to arrive from airport or port by metro, Lito gave excellent instructions for EVERYTHING! The flat was clean, very well equipped with anything you might need, and was in a safe location.

13842245,200044793,2017-10-04,14040894,Sofia,Literally everything about plakas heArt was amazing!! Lito was so nice and punctual and had an itinerary/a laid out map for us to walk with tips on where to eat or get a drink or a coffee and a great place for a good acropolis view or to get a cheap lunch. It was such a great location and we were so sad to leave! It's all you need for a stay in Athens!!!! Could not have ask for more

Thanks again. <br/><br/>Theresa and Al
13842245,202815934,2017-10-13,50326936,Kelsey,"Our flight arrived in Athens at 8am, much too early to check in, but Lito welcomed us and allowed us to drop our bags off while the apartment was cleaned. She proceeded the best welcome packet with a number of restaurants and a great walking guide to see everything Athens had to offer. The place did have some quirks like the shower and only small amount of hot water but the location made up for it."
13842245,204817424,2017-10-20,94876259,Cassändra,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay! We came to Athens for our honeymoon and Lito was a tremendous host. The location of the apartment was PERFECT! Everything you wanted to see was right there only a few minutes away. There were shops and tons of restaurants. It was lively during the day but quiet at night. Lito and her husband were easily reached if we needed anything and very accommodating. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
13842245,205409718,2017-10-22,147926681,Paige,"We had a wonderful stay at Lito’s place. The apartment is close to transit, shops, restaurants and tourist sites like Syntagma square and the Acropolis. We were able to walk everywhere without any issues. Lito provided us with an information package on places to see, restaurants to try and a map to get around. There was water in the fridge and fresh Greek treats when we arrived. The apartment is right in the city centre, so it is far from the airport. Taking the metro from the Syntagma station we found was super effective for getting back to the airport, so we recommend that for other travellers staying here. We would absolutely stay here again next time we visit Athens. Highly recommend!"
13842245,206410789,2017-10-25,19873284,Linda,"Lito's apartment is exactly as described and photographed. Charming, clean, perfectly located and with homey extras including special sweets and sprigs of greenery.

13842245,208178417,2017-10-31,87223172,Åsa,"Rent, snyggt och perfekt läge. Lagom för två men eftersom vi var tre var det lite trångt, det saknas en tredje sittplats. Lito var angelägen att ge oss all information vi behövde och hade förberett med skriftliga förslag på rundtur och förslag på ställen för mat och dryck. Läget är idealiskt och vi kunde gå överallt."
13842245,209802302,2017-11-06,58272580,Andrew,"From the start their hospitality was genuine and obvious. My taxi wasn’t sure of the location and they guided him in. It is very important to tel the taxi man you’re going next to the Adams hotel. When I arrived they were waiting on me to show me around and give me all the important information I would need for a great stay. They even had homemade cookies and water waiting for me! The location is ideal for exploring the Acropolis and Plaka. I didn’t need a taxi for anything except airport transportation and I could have taken the train or the bus if I really wanted to. The apartment is an old building and it isn’t luxurious but the bed is comfortable and I had everything I needed. This is the best value for the location by far, I would stay here again and I will if I return to Athens. I feel as if I gained new friends . Thank you again!! <br/><br/>P.S. BEWARE of the old guys that speak really good English in front of the Acropolis Metro. They will have many things in common with you and will try to lead you to “their restaurant” it’s a trap.. this has nothing to do with the apartment just a valuable piece of information."
13842245,210776919,2017-11-11,134742746,Hannah,"Lovely little flat in an amazing location for anyone going to Athens to see the historical sites, not only are most in walking distance (5 - 10 minutes) but it is a beautiful area too."

The Airbnb is in an amazing area. The apartment itself is very clean, and the host really pays attention to detail. There are helpful hints and tips all over the apartment, and the communication was very easy to get in touch. Plaka is an amazing neighborhood. When you leave the apartment you are a block away from restaurants and shops. Everything is extremely accessible and in walking distance. I highly recommend visiting Athens and highly recommend staying here! I’m looking forward to coming back and would love to stay here again!!!"

13842245,225617422,2018-01-07,55899749,Mariia,"Lito is a very pleasant person! She is very “customer oriented”. Apartment is sooooo cute, comfortable and nice. It is situated in main heart of Athens (Plaka), 10 min to Acropolis...many restaurants nearby... <br/>We were traveling 2 adults and 1 child. The apartment perfectly suited for such company :) When we came, Lito gave us the list of best places to visit...where to eat, have a coffee...market etc. and little map  Also, mamma cookies and traditional candies were waiting for us...it was very cute☺️ So...Lito has Suter-host status and “Lito, you are really SUPER HOST!  Thank you very very much for hospitality in your lovely appartment❤️❤️❤️ Hope to see you again ”"
13842245,226729182,2018-01-12,4964956,Nina,"We had such a lovely stay! The apt is small but very cozy and comfortable, perfect for two adults and a 12 year old. It has everything you need but you’ll probably be out seeing Athens anyway! What a great city! Lito’s recommendations were super helpful and she was really accommodating as well. Would definitely recommend!"
13842245,227172774,2018-01-14,35425967,Petra,"Stayed here in the Plaka area only for 2 nights, wish we had longer such a great location (literally 5 mins walk to the Acropolis entrance gate). Apartment is small but the location more than made up for it, would stay again. Apartment was very quiet at night even though so central, so we slept well.<br/>Lito had left us recommendations for restaurants the ones we tried were excellent, never knew Greek food could taste this good. Yani's Mum made some homemade orange and cinnamon cookies for us which we LOVED, thank you!<br/>"
13842245,228132948,2018-01-18,27865883,Nancy,"Yiannis was our host and he was quick and responsive from when we first booked to when we finally checked out. He met us at the flat upon arrival and supplied us with tips, instructions, and a quick tour of the accommodations. Everything was clean and they even gave us a plate of cookies - very nice touch. The location is accessible to EVERYTHING - we didn’t use the metro even once during our stay there, it was walkable to all the sights and we get safe even walking home at 2 in the morning. Very fun experience and he could not have been nicer - on our last day we accidentally cracked the coffee pot because we put in cold water after making coffee and he was really kind to make sure everything was okay. We loved the hospitality - definitely a great option if you are staying for a few days in Athens."

We highly recommend this spot!"
13842245,241468830,2018-03-09,24966084,Julieta,"El departamento de Lito es lo que uno necesita para una buena estadía en Atenas. Las fotos reflejan tal cual lo que encontras al llegar.<br/>Queda en el centro histórico: a pocas cuadras de la entrada a la Acrópolis, cerca de la plaza donde se toman los autobuses para ir al aeropuerto. Te permite recorrer todo a pie.<br/>Lito nos recibió muy bien: nos mostró los puntos importantes para conocer y nos dejó una guía para hacer un recorrido a pie detallando todo lo q encontraríamos.<br/>Sin duda volvería!"
13842245,242102793,2018-03-11,112579490,Kyra,"Lito is the most helpful person I have encountered on Airbnb thus far. He was extremely informative, giving me multiple modes of transportation from the airport to the flat with detailed instructions. He also met me right outside of his lovely flat and gave me even more information about sightseeing. I would have loved to spend more time in Athens. Thank you so much for your hospitality Lito !!"
13842245,242786936,2018-03-13,128127183,Song Hao,"One of the best Airbnb experience i have ever had. The host was very meticulous and prepared notes on the popular places to visit and modes of transport available with prices. There was even a map with all the areas and attractions marked out clearly.<br/><br/>He was also quick to respond to any queries i had, and his food recommendations were excellent and deserves a mention. Great food at great prices. <br/><br/>The location was also very near to the Acropolis and other historical sites. And the apartment was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again if i visit Athens."
13842245,243754488,2018-03-17,26141628,Clare,"Reviewing on behalf of my parents, they loved Lito who was a delight and could accommodate to their early check-in after a long 13hour flight. Do not miss out trying the biscuits/cookies made by Lito's mum, they were great! The apartment is lovely, large (spacious for 2, enough for 3) and spotlessly clean. It is also located in a safe area, peaceful, accessible to many cafes and its proximity to the Acropolis and other ancient ruins are second to none. Perfect for 2 elderly folks with lots of luggage. The apartment's heavy-duty main door and window grills made my parents feel safe at night as well. The only small issue was the noise after midnight from passersby and other tenants returning home, since the apartment is on the ground floor. Will definitely recommend Lito's place for those visiting Athens!"
13842245,245624619,2018-03-23,149101697,Roy,"The Best thing about Plaka's HeArt was the location. It is in the centre for good quality Bars, Restaurants and places to visit all within walking distance. Our Host was very welcoming and helpful. The accommodation was very homely and clean. No hesitation in recommending this accommodation."
13842245,246816403,2018-03-26,35248204,Lydia,The location is excellent - just steps away from major attractions in Plaka! We had clear instructions for how to get there. The space met all out expectations. Great stay in Athens!

Extrêmement près de tout, on a pu visiter les grands sites en marchant pour y accéder. Pour des visites plus éloignées ou tout simplement arriver de l'aéroport, les transports sont à quelques minutes.<br/>Très bonne communication. Je vous recommande +++"

13842245,263961607,2018-05-13,164717709,Ben,"Cozy, secure flat in the heart of Plaka. Lito and Niko were responsive, helpful and had a wealth of knowledge of the area and local restaurants they shared with us. Check in was SUPER easy. Our flight plans changed a few times but Lito and Niko were always willing to make sure we could get into the apartment. I highly recommend it!"
13842245,265447664,2018-05-17,5751384,Carolina,"Lito is a wonderful host, easy to communicate with, very thoughtful. She has local tips in print for guests with a map and that is just a gem! The place is beautiful, very comfortable and romantic. Location is ideal. It is great that you can always come by the flat between activities knowing you won't go out of your way. Would definitely come back!"

13842245,272249044,2018-06-03,64794114,Catalina,"Lito's place is great for a few days in Athens. The location is the best part about it, it's in a nice neighborhood in Plaka and very close to the Acropolis, national gardens, and Syntagma Square. We could easily walk to everything and had lots of food options at our doorstep. Check in is easy and the apartment is luckily on the ground floor. Lito was nice enough to let us check in early and gave us a map with tips on what to do and where to eat, which was very useful!<br/>The only negative things about the apartment were the beds and the lack of natural light. Both beds were uncomfortable, but the small one especially is not a real mattress but more of a foam pad. I am young and don't usually have back problems but I would wake up every night in pain from the bed and pillow. The main room of the apartment is well lit by a large window, but the area with the small bed and the kitchen are very dark. If you are looking for a central stay and don't care too much about comfort, I would definitely recommend this place."
13842245,274040150,2018-06-08,5097329,Alle & Renee,"Wij hadden vóór en tijdens onze citytrip contact met beheerder Yiannis, die bijzonder behulpzaam was. Het appartement heeft een unieke ligging aan de rand van Plaka, niet meer dan een paar stappen verwijderd van het bruisende toeristische centrum van Athene. Tot onze verrassing merkte je van die drukte in het appartement helemaal niets; het is er 's nachts heel rustig! Alle grote toeristische attracties zoals de tempel van Zeus, het antieke Olympische stadion, het Acropolis Museum en de Acropolis bevinden zich op loopafstand en bussen en metroverbindingen zijn uitstekend. Het appartement is basic ingericht maar het ontbrak ons aan niets, Kortom: een superhost en een heerlijke plek om thuis te komen na een dag in de warme drukte van de stad! Wij zullen Plaka's Heart zeker aanbevelen!"
13842245,274860725,2018-06-10,60295991,Phil,Great spot in a fantastic location. We really appreciated the local tip sheet that was left for us as well as the delicious cookies! Definitely recommended!

13842245,285623677,2018-07-04,51696238,Jonathan,GREAT location! Plaka was easily the best area to stay in. Lito was very friendly and had nice suggestions for restaurants.<br/><br/>The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. AC and drinkable tap water was a life-saver! The kitchen is very small so don’t expect to do a lot of cooking there (but the restaurants and cafes nearby more than make up for it.)

The main floor provides easy access. Lito was always quick to respond to communication and her associate, Nikos, was our contact during our stay. He met us and provided a friendly, informative orientation and was very helpful responding to any questions we had when communicating through text or email. <br/>We would stay there again.

13842245,293845073,2018-07-21,159528975,Steven,"This flat is in a great location for tourists to Athens! Walking distance to all kinds of restaurants, shops and attractions as well as close to the Metro system which you can use to get anywhere.    Very comfortable for two people.  I was initially concerned to learn that it was a street level, but it is a quiet pedestrian way so was not an issue at all.  If I really had to find something to complain about it would be that because this is a small flat with a small bathroom, the shower is small so you get attacked by the shower curtain. :)   "

The apartment is clean and spacious. The location is AMAZING! It is right in the middle of Plaka, and you can walk to any of the sites, restaurants, and shops. The apartment is also equipped with plenty of great suggestions and helpful tips! I will absolutely stay here again when I come back to Athens! "

Lito is very responsive to questions and thoughtful throughout the stay, even asking if we needed more blankets because the night grew chilly. Lito really made us feel at home in Athens, from the guided walk he provided to the cookies waiting for us. Wonderful experience."
13842245,343044079,2018-10-30,127604951,Morgan & Brad,"My husband and I were blown away by this beautiful flat in the heart of Athens! The bed was comfortable, there was a coffee machine, shower amenities, extra blankets, air conditioner, and so many other lovely touches. The location was absolutely perfect. We walked everywhere we wanted to go. The flat is located on a quiet residential street, but a 3 min walk leads you to this amazing strip of shops and markets. We really enjoyed our time there. One tip: you don’t need to rent a car! All you really need is airport transfer, everything else is walkable. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Athens. It was perfect!"

La posizione è un grandissimo punto di forza: si può raggiungere tutte le bellezze di Atene, alla sera si è nel centro della vita e a pochi minuti a piedi si possono raggiungere altri punti di passeggio serale. Ci tornerei sicuramente.<br/><br/>The apartment is small, very welcoming and well organized. Although small it is very spacious. The location is a great point of strength: you can reach all the beauties of Athens, in the evening you are in the center of life and a few minutes walk you can reach other points of evening stroll. I would definitely stay there again."

Lito's place is in the perfect location - we didn't need to get a metro anywhere as everything was within walking distance. Despite this, streets of Plaka are pedestrianised and when we arrived at night the area the apartment is in was lovely and quiet - it was like stepping back in time. Everything was spotlessly clean, and the apartment had all that we needed (including cookies baked by Lito's mother!) They have even taken the time to write a walking guide to the area to see the main sites, which we did both in the day and at night. Thanks again for everything - we will recommend you to our friends!"

Lito is very responsive and profeesional host (:  we change our airbnb appartment to Lito's and very happy in retrospect for doing so.

13842245,437717380,2019-04-15,215033105,Venu,"Lito’s place in plAka is excellently located, and nice cosy apartment. Ideal for two people, but three can also manage. The amenities are well thought of, and has everything that one would need. Finding the place could have been a bit challenging, but the instructions given were spot on, and so we did not struggle despite it being 4 am in the morning. Only tip is that you must follow the directions and location map given by the hosts, and do not trust (Hidden by Airbnb) location for this - we initially ended up 1 km away, having chosen to follow the (Hidden by Airbnb) directions!<br/><br/>All in all, a great value for money place to stay minutes away from all the iconic landmarks of Athens."
13842245,441525503,2019-04-22,15152831,Victoria,"El apartamento es cómodo y muy agradable, y con mucho estilo. Está en el centro de Plaka y todo funciona perfectamente (agua, calefacción, etc).

There were many positive aspects to this cute flat.  The location is amazing!   Plaka really is so nice and the evenings there get very fun.  Lito's mother's cookies tasted very authentic with tasty Greek flavors.  The only negative is the water heater.  You need to turn on the water heater 30 minutes before your shower and when you take showers early in the morning it can be very inconvenient.   Other than that the flat was Amazing and Lito was very accommodating and nice to us.  We only stayed one night but wished we could have stayed more there

Centrally located and minutes from the Acropolis. Lito is a fantastic host. There was constant communication and she was quick to respond to my many questions. She also arranged our transport from the airport and to the ferry terminal with a great taxi driver. So worth the money. We loved the personal touch when we arrived; homemade cookies from her mom. So sweet and thoughtful. Our 2 night stay was very enjoyable. Would highly recommend Lito’s apartment. ( June 29,2019)"

Enjoyed the coffee that was provided, and the homemade treats left for us.  Bed was super comfortable.   And so happy about airconditioning, as it was very warm out.  Thank you to our hosts!  Plus, want to add we ordered our taxi through the host; the driver was super, and had a nice car too!<br/>!"

Had to contact her re the tv not working. Great location in the Plaka area of Athens!<br/>Lito had left a plate of her mother’s cookies for us, which was lovely. Water could be boiled on a hot plate as no electric jug"
13842245,510444205,2019-08-16,30555582,Alessandra,"Lito’s flat is very nice and well cleaned. The location is excellent for visiting the heart of Athens. It’s very closed both to Acropoli’s entrance and shops and restaurants. Lito is a nice person, he’s very professional and he tries to  arrange everything you need. <br/>We thank you very much!!!"
13842245,512365870,2019-08-18,128602628,Jacqueline,"O apartamento tem excelente localização, principalmente para nós que ficamos de sexta.m a domingo de manhã. O Lito é muito atencioso e tirou todas nossa dúvidas e deu excelentes sugestões. O lugar tem um<br/>Tamanho bom, vc consegue se locomove e abrir as malas. O apartamento estava super limpo e cheiroso. Os cookies feitos pela mãe do Lito são um mimo a mais. Muito perto da acropolis e das estações de trem. Eu ficaria nele outra vez com certeza."

13842245,520211263,2019-08-30,71521919,Carla,"The apartment is perfectly located.  We did the suggested walk which was detailed ams easy to follow.  I had a few things on my list to see that I thought I would have to skip but the walk led us to see everything.  I really enjoyed the proximity to the Acropolis,the Plaka, and other areas in which all felt safe.  The apartment was very clean,  bed was comfortable,  and the kitchen was sufficiently stocked with tea and coffee. The homemade cookies was also delicious.  What I loved most was the detailed instructions.  I always have a little anxiety about being in someone's home and the were very detailed instructions for everything."

The location is prime: close to the Acropolis but in a safe neighborhood and the place is clean and simple. Lito was a great host, providing quick responses and a very useful list of recommendations of things to do, cafes, restaurants, etc., and also useful instructions for getting to the place from the airport. If you're visiting Athens for a couple days, this is a great place to do so!"
13842245,525019207,2019-09-07,97835789,Antonio,"Our time at Lito’s house is just amazing. The place is really in the heart of Plaka (very nice, really). I strongly recommend this place to stay when you are in Athena’s. By the way, the cookie is really tasty."

The location is amazing - a cute, quiet street, just steps away from the excitement of the Plaka tourist area. Amazing restaurants and fun shopping nearby, plus just a few minutes walk to all the historic sites. The apartment itself is charming and comfortable, and Lito made the process easy and enjoyable. Can’t say enough great things about this apartment!"

13842245,536125822,2019-09-26,19234498,Stephen,Staying at Plaka's Heart was a real pleasure the location was amazing. The apartment is small and simple with everything required for  a short stay in this the most beautiful district of a beautiful city.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that taxi access to the apartment entrance is sometimes difficult but it is no hardship to walk the last hundred meters from the main road. Your reward is peace and quiet and the pedestrianised zone!

13842245,547435816,2019-10-15,3962010,Jennifer,"Great location-- in the middle of the Plaka district, while still being tucked away from the tourists. Easy self-checkin and great communication. Host even set out homemade cookies. Would recommend this place, but would also recommend bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper, as the building is old and on the ground floor. Thanks for a great stay!"

The flat was very clean and had many amenities. Lito was very accommodating and quick to respond in helping us book taxis as we could not make phone calls ourselves. A/c worked great. Water is drinkable. Windows has shutter blinds for privacy. Equipped kitchen and good sized fridge with ice cube trays. Comfortable bed. Very clean. Would definitely stay here again!"

We felt safe at all times. The airbnb was spotless. Plus her mother made cookies and left it for us, which were so good! We are island hopping and coming back to Lito place and we are so happy we get to enjoy it again. Definitely recommend, and if we come back we would stay here again."
13842245,563237901,2019-11-12,97495627,Bindu,"This place has sweet charm and a great location. Only minutes from the acropolis and so many great restaurants and shops nearby! There’s also a luggage storage place nearby that we used while we traveled during the day after checkout which was referred to us by Lito and so helpful. The place has a water heater and despite turning it on as instructed, we did run out of warm water which was a bit of a bummer, but the experience overall was fabulous, easy and the place was so cute. Highly recommend."
13842245,563851086,2019-11-14,55855659,Greela Joy,Lito’s place was in the most perfect location and was better than we imagined! It was a mere<br/>Short walk to everything that we needed!

13842245,564557324,2019-11-16,92723637,Charleen,"This is a second time back at litos airbnb! This time we needed a place for our luggage as opposed to leaving it at a luggage store place or carrying it around with us for hours, and Lito let us place our bags in the room since 11am even though it would’ve been a 3pm check in. So grateful! As always, super clean and comfortable. She left home made cookies that my husband and I loved. Place is in the best neighborhood with so many options for food and minutes walk to Acropolis.  Book this Airbnb!"

This apartment is a very convenient location. Today we walked all the way around the Acropolis following Lito’s written instructions. It was absolutely stellar.  The apartment is located on the ground floor which is good for us and on a pedestrian  street, but only a block away from main road. <br/> The WiFi is excellent, bed and linens very comfortable. There is a kitchen , an foyer with a single bed, double doors to large bedroom and bathroom. You flip a switch a turn water heater 1/2 hour before a shower, which is no problem. <br/>We were very appreciative of Lito for arranging a taxi to pickup us at the airport. We have taken the metro and train in past but, it was very fast and convenient. It would be easy to take a Metro to this apartment and the walk with aid of  a Maps app.<br/>We are very appreciative to Lito for for facilitating the return of my husband bag which he had left in the taxi. She made special trip to apartment to return it to us.  Looking for returning."

The fact that the building stayed cool even in the worst heat was a pleasant surprise. Additionally, the AC was a lifesaver. The beds were very comfortable.

13842245,454031877584666744,2021-09-18,24937940,Christina,"We were only in Athens for 1 night, and this place was in the most perfect location. Could walk to shopping, restaurants…all of the main things we wanted to see. Bed was comfortable. The taxi we arranged with the host never picked us up at the airport, it ended up being really easy to get a taxi while there and it was cheaper than what we would have paid when set up through host. Other than recommending you arrange your own transportation…the Airbnb itself couldn’t have been more perfect! Would stay again."

Si buscas algo a buen precio, limpio, seguro y desde donde puedes ir a todo andando … sin duda te gustará. Muy buena Calidad precio!"
13842245,460641436268258950,2021-09-27,284427878,Ori,"The host is very nice, we have not met him but via messages it was clear. He also gave us a lot of information about the apartment so we won't have any questions, but unfortunately the air conditioner did not work... The host said it takes time to work but we kept it on for the whole night and it did not work.<br/>Other than that everything was OK and the location is great, I recommend this host and apartment  just contact the host first and make sure the air conditioner is working and how to make it work."

They even let us leave our bags early during the cleaning, which was going above and beyond. We stayed on a Saturday night and could hear a few people walking and talking up until 10:45pm. Our host even set us up with a 25 euro taxi at 6am  to take us to the ferry. Great place! Great value! Great communication."

13842245,476557150518005689,2021-10-19,18912447,David,Fantastic location. Right in the heart of things. They had a truly wonderful custom guided walk around the center to hit all the best spots and even enjoyable dome for free (without buying entry to sites)!! As well as recommendations for other things. <br/><br/>Communication was on point — they sent everything you needed to know timely in concise messaging. Really well oiled operation. <br/><br/>Don’t be late with check out though—they were ready to clean at 11! Very kind and accommodating about it :)
13842245,477258831899192024,2021-10-20,212631155,Narda,Lito's airbnb was very convenient to walk to the Acropolis.  Was very comfortable and enjoyed the neighbourhood.  Appreciated the instructions and amenities left for guests.  Would definitely stay here again.  Travellers from North America who have never travelled abroad should just be prepared for  washroom facilities equivalent to older European city plumbing systems with smaller hot water tanks.

13843004,169898377,2017-07-14,90392536,Uwe,Georgios place can be highly recommanded. It's tiny but real cosy and enough space for 2 persons. It 's pretty close to either bus or metro station (we prefered the metro) and from there you are at the acropolis or plaka in no time at all. Georgios with his friendliness is a perfect host and you have a perfect view from his roof top. 
13843004,172485711,2017-07-21,45504615,Emmanuel,"Un excellent accueil. Georgios est un hôte très gentil et très réactif. Un problème de WIFI a été réglé très raidement.<br/>L'appartement a  du potentiel, une belle vue, mais nécessite un renouvellement d'une partie du mobilier et de l'équipement de cuisine. Salle de bains - WC très petits.<br/>Quartier correct, bien situé par rapport aux moyens de transport, hormis les moustiques très présents dans toute la la rue de l'immeuble."
13843004,174784213,2017-07-27,13598543,Michelle,Georgio's place is a great place to stay while exploring Athens and its environs. Pretty close to everything as described and he is very accommodating in case of very late check-ins. The bathroom is a bit of a tight squeze but it does the job:) Thanks for a great stay Georgio. 
13843004,175518646,2017-07-29,22807531,Lisa,Georgio was a great host! He was waiting for me when I arrived and showed me the apartment. The wi-fi was excellent and the location very easy to get to where ever you wanted. There was even a washing machine which was perfect after returning from the islands. <br/><br/>The apartment was quiet and the bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. <br/><br/>I would definetely stay here again!
13843004,186717554,2017-08-25,105363256,Angela,"Georgio's place was nice and small. It had a nice balcony and was a great location to and from the airport and also to and from downtown Athens. Apart from that it seemed that he may not have inspected the place prior to having us check-in. The first time I sat on one of the twin beds I instantly fell through as the previous tenants had broken the frame. Georgio saw what had happened and fixed it right away when we went downtown. Also, it was a little tough to shower as the shower head did not have a hook to hold it on the wall, so we had to hold the shower head the whole time to take a shower. All in all, Georgio was very easy to communicate with and was very helpful in helping us get around via metro and bus."

It was in a very fancy neighborhood and just 5 minutes to walk to the main square. We even did not need to buy metro ticket during the vocation. Equipment in the house was very sufficient. Especially the blankets!!!!! WE love them:) Even thought steal them:)<br/><br/>Overall it was great visit for us. There is nothing that I can complain.

By 11pm I was all situated and taken care of. The apartment is lovely and the view is spectacular. The kitchen is well equipped and everything worked flawlessly.

However, the lift at the apartment was not working and the house was on the 5th floor (Nestor did inform us of this 3 days before the trip). <br/><br/>What really made this a 4-star stay was the lack of WiFi. Upon contacting Nestor, we were told that wifi was down for the entire town and we had to wait a day for it to start working but it was still not back till the time we left Nestor's place.<br/><br/>All in all a nice little home but the lack of a lift and wifi made our stay less enjoyable."
13854508,271013589,2018-05-31,89221364,Jeff,"Great place, close to transportation and historic places. Nestor is very detail oriented and has explanations on how to use everything. His place was well stocked with multiple recommendations on where to eat, shop and local attractions. "
13854508,273195609,2018-06-05,23808,Mary,"Nestor’s place was perfect for our party of five adults. Good sized and the air conditioning worked perfectly.<br/>We only stayed one night recovering from jet lag and then departing from the nearby metro station directly to Piraeus the next morning. The flat was quiet, clean and comfortable. <br/>My only disappointment was the lack of a working elevator and the climb up 6 flights of stairs is a chore.<br/>One thing to note is going up and down you need to push the stairway light button at each level to make it to the top.<br/>Check in was very easy and convenient. Price was great."
13854508,273695649,2018-06-07,192909483,Mika,"Nestor place is very nice, modern, and up to date! He responds very quickly and knows lots about the transportation around the apartment! We had a great stay! "
13854508,275911482,2018-06-12,19697868,Keith,The apartment is conveniently located very close to the metro so getting around Athens is very easy. Nestor's place is clean and spacious with everything you would need to enjoy your stay provided. I'd highly recommend it to anyone spending time in Athens!
13854508,276865758,2018-06-15,57791015,Shahin,"Great Apartment, clean and very specious !! for athens sightseeing you need to take the bus or metro which are very close to this house !! in general i recommend it to anyone who is in 20-45 years old range since the elavator is not working and you need to walk 5 floors up !!<br/><br/>thanks nestor for your hospitality ! <br/><br/>will see you again"
13854508,279946815,2018-06-22,185872311,Lapas,Fully occupied flat. No problems for public parking on street. Around streets looks not safe at night. 
13854508,287308155,2018-07-08,17519364,Supriya,Comfortable place with loads of instructions. There is a note at every wall which made us feel that It lacked the personal touch. Also the elevator doesn't work and apartment is on the 5th floor. Be ready to lug your bags. Other that that no complaints. Self check in was super smooth. Fairly comfortable for a group of 5 and quite clean.
13854508,288942277,2018-07-11,158265745,Jean-Paul,Excellent place in Athens

13854508,341497206,2018-10-27,100073490,Claire,The self check in was really easy. Keys easy to obtain at the communal door. The five flights of stairs were no issue for me and my teenaged boys. Flat clean and tidy and had everything you needed. Small supermarkets on every block around and a decent café nearby. Easy to get about from nearby metro station. Nestor was very quick to help with a v small problem. Recommended.
13854508,344315566,2018-11-03,163437117,Minmin,Great apartment! And Nextor gave us a lot of useful tips!

13854508,355466220,2018-12-04,53737563,Haley,"We loved staying at this Airbnb! There were 3 of us total and it was very comfortable. The bedrooms are huge, the beds are comfy, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the living room was spacious as well. <br/><br/>WiFi was perfect for our needs. Get connection, no lagging. <br/><br/>The instructions for self-checkin were very easy to follow and we didn’t have any issues finding the place or getting into the apartment. <br/><br/>Nester communicated well with us and he offered a lot of help. <br/><br/>The apartment is very organized and there are instructions written all over the apartment, which made everything even easier. <br/><br/>We walked everywhere for sightseeing/shopping/food/etc. If you don’t love walking the metro is close by too. We just prefer walking so we can see more. There are even some thrift shops nearby that I bought a sweater at for 3 euros! <br/><br/>Great stay. No complaints."
13854508,357372724,2018-12-10,135651730,Paula,The accommodation was bigger then expected and had a nice living-kitchen area. Also it had two toilets which was really good for 5 people. I liked the style and the furniture as well. Especially the bed was comfortable. Nestor always answered fast and helped us with all the questions. Also there were instructions about the flat everywhere. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend the flat and Nestor as a host!

13854508,411026003,2019-02-11,42174081,Maya,"Our favourite Airbnb experience in Greece. And one of the best in all our travels :) we met Emiljano , who was very friendly. we loved the kitchen, the shower, the two toilets, the comfy rooms, the balconies... everything was just great, very modern and cozy. The lack of elevator is a bit tiring sometimes but it’s a very good exercice for your thighs and cardio ;-) the neighbourhood is okay, there are two supermarkets very close, and Victoria station is 8 minutes away on foot, there’s a good falafel place (enjoy just falafel) on the way from there. The wifi worked well, heating system worked well. Lovely stay! Thank you so much!"
13854508,411683464,2019-02-13,71604255,Montalbano,"a very nice apartment, not far from the metro. Nestor and Emiljano are very welcoming and are ready to recommend their best addresses."

Das Einchecken war auch mitten in der Nacht problemlos !<br/>Die Besitzer ( Emiljano und Nestor ) sind sehr gastfreundlich und jederzeit bei Fragen erreichbar. Die Wohnung war blitzsauber und jedes Detail wurde schön ausgeschildert, sodass man nicht lange suchen musste."
13854508,424711508,2019-03-17,31011377,Jan-Hendrik,"Really nice, quiet and spacious apartment. Equipped with everything you need and more (dish washer, washing machine, iron, Chromecast, 2 toilets, airconditioning in every room). Communications with the host was really easy. A lot of sights are in walking distance otherwise metrostation Victoria is really nearby. All in all a great apartment to stay when you want to explore the fascinating city of Athens"
13854508,432493166,2019-04-04,222154474,Hristo,"Great hosts, responsive, careful and punctuate. The location is on a walking distance to most touristic attractions - a park, Monastiraki square, Archaeological museum, National Library, Numismatic museum, Parliament, National Garden. Acropolis is the farthest with 45 min. walk, which is also doable. Transport is only needed for going to the seaside. We were delighted by our stay and highly recommend this apartment!"
13854508,433352194,2019-04-06,247185390,Miriam,"From start to finish, both Nestor and Emiljano were extremely helpful with everything and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The actual apartment was tastefully furnished, spacious, and spotless. The check in was made very simple and the view of Mt. Lecabyttus from the porch was very nice. All in all, we had an extremely satisfactory stay and would highly recommend."

Save those steps for the Acropolis.. <br/>The Apartment is nice and spacious and clean. We did make use of the fully fitted kitchen and where lucky enough to buy an Octopus from the local supermarket. The actual area of Victoria is a little a shabby but it is very safe.  I would recommend without hesitation."

13854508,465060591,2019-06-07,65886154,Sina,Nestor really tries hard to keep good care of his guests. Always responsive and give you all the information you need.  He also let us check in sooner than what it should be which was great favour after an 11 hours flight.
13854508,466474637,2019-06-09,170748147,Jacob,"Great apartment, tons of space, well furnished"

13854508,476836588,2019-06-27,114230968,Francisco,"I definitely recommend staying in this apartment. The communication was clear and accurate from beginning to end, also the host was always available for our questions and needs. The apartment is tidy, clean and contains all the necessary elements for a comfortable stay. The  flat is in the center of Athens but you need to take convenient transportation to all the touristic venues. I think the cost is according to the location, cleanliness and service."
13854508,479527470,2019-07-01,253790785,Rusununguko,"Nestor was in constant communication with us from before the trip, at the Airport, he even spoke to the taxi driver. Nestor is very good at explaining to you how to enjoy your time in Athens, from getting around and the correct price you should pay for everything so that you are not overcharged.  He was there for check-in even though we arrived late night. The apartment is very clean and everything works. Nestor is an awesome host!"

Solo dejar constancia de los 6 pisos que hay que subir. Y no hay ascensor. Para que lo tengan en consideración por si viaja alguien con movilidad reducida.<br/>La cocina full equipo. Pueden lavar y colgar la ropa si lo necesitan.<br/>El barrio tiene un supermercado a 100 metros.<br/>El metro está muy cerca. A solo dos estaciones del centro histórico.<br/>Es de los mejores alojamientos en los que he estado. Realmente Nestor y compañía hacen un muy buen trabajo.<br/>Lo recomiendo 100%"
13854508,523654368,2019-09-04,55225304,Manon,Très bel appartement qui correspond aux photo. Très bien équipé. C'est vrai que quartier n'est pas très rassurant mais nous étions un groupe de 4 filles et nous n'avons eu aucuns problèmes dans ce coin pendant presque 2 semaines... Le métro est à 5min à pied en marchant vite. <br/>Encore merci !

13854508,533111497,2019-09-21,263199414,Elin,"Nestors leilighet er helt grei, romslig, med to soverom, stue/kjøkken og bad med en super dusj. Litt slitt kanskje enkelte steder, men god valuta for pengene! Og Nestor er virkelig en vert som følger opp! Og lytt for all del til advarslene hans om taxisjåfører og lommetyver. Pass inderlig godt på vesker og andre løse gjenstander i Athen. Det fikk jeg bittert erfare. Da veska med nøkler til leiligheten forsvant var Nestor 100% støttende og fikset nye nøkler i en fart."
13854508,535373602,2019-09-24,6793367,Peshraw,"Nestor’s place was sparkling clean in the apartment and you will have every kitchen and other utensils you need as your home. The bedrooms and living room and kitchen are also very spacious. Nestor communicated very well with as before traveling, as soon as we landed and throughout the time we stayed here. <br/><br/>Nestor also frankly informed us in advance that the elevator was not working and that we had to take the staircase to the 5th floor. That could be quite a bit of walking us for someone and very hard for someone that’s elderly. I would recommend you staying at this apartment."
13854508,536572492,2019-09-27,50033099,Katrin,"Thanks for hosting us! The place is central and near to the tourist attractions area (2 or 3 metro stations away). I’m amazed with the apartment cleanliness and it’s modern despite of the old building conditions. Great job for the host! <br/><br/>Very fast response and they really care about the guests condition. I really recommend this apartment! Especially for young people/healthy people because it’s on the 5th floor without elevators.<br/><br/>Guest shouldn’t be worry because it’s in Victoria square area. Pick pockets are everywhere. All tourist area, not just Victoria, are the same. So it is everybody responsibility to take care their belongings no matter where the area you stayed.<br/><br/>Good luck Nestor and co!"

Es sind für die Gäste Tipps und Empfehlungen für einen angenehmen Aufenthalt ausgelegt.
13854508,547417068,2019-10-15,278809710,Artem,"My friends and I lived in this apartment for seven days. We were satisfied, the housing is located near the metro Victoria. The host Nestor was friendly and attentive. The apartment has everything for a comfortable stay. We definitely recommend this house."

Set in an amazing location, sparkling clean, and full of fantastic tips on how to best experience Athens, Nestor goes above and beyond for his guests and truly made Athens one of my favorite experiences in Europe."
13854508,552199604,2019-10-21,62605120,Mariusz,"Gorąco polecam apartament u Nestora. Wspaniały i szybki kontakt z gospodarzem, mieszkanie ładne, czyste przestronne i co najważniejsze z balkonem i klimatyzacją."
13854508,553461129,2019-10-24,37218591,Thorsten,"Das Appartement von Nestor ist sehr sauber, gut und modern eingerichtet und zentral gelegen. Zur nächsten Metro Station sind es 5 Minuten zu Fuß. Der Besitzer und der Verwalter haben uns nett empfangen und ich war bislang in keiner mehr organisierten AirBNB Unterkunft. Wirklich Alles wurde per Aushang erklärt und geregelt. Die Klimaanlage und das WLAN funktionieren hervorragend.<br/><br/>Das Appartement befindet sich in einem, um es mal nett zu sagen, nicht sehr ansehnlichen Viertel von Athen in einem noch unansehnlicherem Mehrfamilienhaus mit ca. 12 Parteien. Man hatte den Eindruck, dass kein Hausbewohner sich um die Gemeinschaftsbereiche wie z.B. das Treppenhaus kümmert, was aber natürlich nicht dem Vermieter anzulasten ist. <br/><br/>Ich war mit 3 Kindern dort und hatte nun kein unsicheres Gefühl, aber jemand, der ein wenig ängstlicher ist oder insbesondere Probleme mit viel Treppensteigen hat (das Appartement liegt im 5. Stückwerk und die Treppe ist sehr eng und steil), sollte sich vielleicht eine andere Unterkunft suchen. Das Positive daran ist, man befindet sich in einem multikulturell sehr heterogenem Viertel und erlebt das Leben in Athen hautnah."
13854508,556318556,2019-10-29,165549882,Rahela,As described. Lots of local and helpful information. As described.

13854508,563552239,2019-11-13,23289979,Radoslaw,"Mieszkanie było dla naszej czwórki wystarczające. Podróżowaliśmy wynajętym samochodem, który udawało się zawsze zaparkować na ulicy pod domem. Ceniliśmy zmywarkę do naczyń i pralkę. W kuchni było wystarczające wyposażenie do przygotowania posiłków. Łóżka były wygodne a sypialnie zlokalizowane są od dziedzińca, więc nie przeszkadzał hałas drogowy. Wejście na piąte piętro bez działającej windy może być utrudnieniem dla osób mniej mobilnych. Bardzo  polecamy mieszkanie Nestora."

The apartment is geographically well located in the city because it is close to the city center and especially to the train. There is also a supermarket at 200m! The neighborhood is calm. We felt safe, even during the night. Nestor is a great host, very available and easily reachable."
13854508,581932915,2019-12-26,17456801,Basil,Nestor is a fantastic host and very kind. His place is very good. I will recommend this place if you're in Athens.

It was clean, they provided ample towels, and the Chromecast connected to the TV was a nice touch for the moments where my friend and I decided to stay in. All in all, I would stay here again!"

The apartment was the cleanest it could be, and it had everything you need for a perfect stay! It also helps you stay fit by climbing on the 5th floor!! The location is pretty good, and close enough to the city centre! The contact with the hosts couldn't be better, with all the help and the advices and the answers you're looking for. Thank you both!"

Chris hatte immer sehr nützliche Tips, auch zum empfohlenen Verhalten an den großen Touristen Hotspots in Athen und hatt immer sehr schnell und nett auf Fragen geantwortet.<br/>Die Unterkunft war super sauber und mit ausreichender Ausstattung.<br/>Ich wünsche Chris und Nestor weiterhin alles Gute und bedanke mich riesig, dass ich dort mit meinen Freunden unterkommen konnte."
13854508,475108859694346082,2021-10-17,417689821,Ivan,"The apartment is located pretty close to center (3-4 euro drive by a taxi). And it is not in one of the touristic areas, but close. So the prices in caffès around and shops are a bit cheaper.<br/><br/>Also the apartment by itself is clean and accurate."
13855172,495418856,2019-07-26,266403640,Lexi,"Esi was so responsive, communicative, and easy to get a hold of, despite me not having a functioning phone number for the trip. <br/>The apartment is located in one of the safest areas in Athens, and for being a studio, it's nicely furnished and a cute place to stay in. My boyfriend and I comfortably stayed here for around a full month."

13860639,87247327,2016-07-19,32503994,Jennifer,L'appartement correspond tout à fait aux photos. Tamara a fait en sorte que je me sente bien durant mon séjour et prend le temps de discuter. L'Acropole est à quelques minutes à pied ainsi que de bonnes adresses. Je recommande cet appartement très intéressant pour son rapport qualité-prix.
13860639,87649556,2016-07-21,14014992,Sheryl,"The room was nice and clean and had everything we needed. Even though the bathroom was shared it didn't feel like it as it was very clean and always available. It was so nice to chill out on the balcony as well. <br/>The best part was Tamara's hospitality as she gave us recommendations and directions for places to eat and things to see in Athens. She even gave us vital information on how to get to our next destination, Kefalonia, as clear instructions weren't given online. "
13860639,88286019,2016-07-24,34587517,Sbriglio,"L'appartement est situé à deux pas d'une station de métro. En 5 minutes on est à l'Acropole ! 
<br/>Le quartier est plutôt calme. 
<br/>Tamara est très sympathique et joyeuse, elle a été très arrangeante :)"
13860639,89886019,2016-07-30,69929597,Ruth,"Tamara was a welcoming host with lots of helpful information for finding the property and what to do in the neighbourhood. The property is in an AMAZING location for visiting the Acropolis and lots of the touristy things, it's also one of the nicer neighbourhoods in Athens, with lots of good transport links.
<br/>The only problem was if you can't handle the heat book one of the other two rooms (they have Air Con). This room has a (weak) fan and not AC. It was sooooo hot at night, unbearable at times. This had a big impact on our stay. Also we were left unimpressed by how some of the other guests would leave the bathroom, in particular.
<br/>Saying this it is probably one of the better value options in Athens."
13860639,90681730,2016-08-01,65184605,Nick,"Tamara was very helpful, communicative and friendly. She kept in regular contact to arrange meeting, met me at the metro station, and then gave me an introduction to the apartment and described the neighbourhood.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment was very clean, and was particularly impressed by the kitchen.  Bathroom fine. Bedroom fine. The only flaw was the lack of furniture in the lounge, but once it is more lived in will be a bit more homely. 
<br/>
<br/>Overall, good budget accommodation, and both Tamara and Theo were super friendly. "
13860639,91393277,2016-08-05,17295221,Priya,I was pleasantly surprised with my visit here! One of the best Airbnb's that I have stayed in. Tamara was so kind with helping me out with everything. She even brought me out to visit Athens which was amazing! Will definetly come back to visit!! 
13860639,92604177,2016-08-09,53723634,Magda Lo,"Το δωμάτιο ήταν αρκετά καλό και ακριβώς όπως εμφανίζεται στις φωτογραφίες. Ήταν μικρό, αλλά καθαρό και βολικό για τις τρεις ημερες που το θέλαμε. 
<br/>Η Ταμάρα σαν οικοδέσποινα ήταν πολύ φιλική. Ήρθε άμεσα σε επικοινωνία μαζί μας και προσφερθηκε να μας πάρει απο το μέτρο, αλλά και να μας δώσει πληροφορίες για την περιοχή. 
<br/>Το σπίτι ηταν δυο λεπτα απο το σταθμο μετρο Συγγρου-Φιξ, ακριβως δίπλα στο κεντρο. Ηταν καθαρό, με μπαλκόνι, αλλά δεν είχε πολλά επιπλα. 
<br/>Το δωμάτιο ηταν εξοπλισμένο με σεντόνια, πετσέτες και ανεμιστηρα, ο οποίος όμως δεν ηταν αρκετός για την υπερβολική ζέστη του Αυγούστου στην Αθήνα. 
<br/>Η κουζίνα ηταν εξοπλισμένη με τα παντα. Δεν χρησιμοποιησαμε το φουρνο, το ψυγείο όμως θα μπορούσε να έχει λίγο καλύτερη ψύξη.
<br/>Το μονο αρνητικό ηταν η καθαριότητα του μπάνιου. Η μπανιέρα , το δάπεδο και ο νιπτηρας χρειάζονται λίγο περισσότερη προσοχή.
<br/>Κατα τα αλλα, ολα ηταν μια χαρά, η τοποθεσία άριστη για οποίον θέλει να γνωρίσει την Αθήνα. Σας το προτείνω!"
13860639,94537490,2016-08-16,73444161,Xiao,Tamara picked us up from the metro station and made going to a foreign country so much easier. She is so nice and welcoming and it was a joy getting to know her. We will definitely stay again next time we visit! Could not have asked for a better Airbnb for the price

<br/>Only thing that could be changed is maybe a better curtain so the neighbours cant look into the room ;)"

The flat is in a great central area and good value for money. The room didn´t get very hot even though it was 35+ outside which was great! Thanks :)"

13860639,104915149,2016-09-29,60098211,Lauren,"Overall, we had a nice stay with Tamara. She is very responsive and does what she can to help us into the apartment. She also gave us some good tips about what to see. Her place is very close to all the attractions of Athens and just about 5-10 minute walk from the metro. The room itself is very small and the place is not a clean as listed in the pictures. We also ran out of hot water, which was unexpected. With that being said, this is a great location and probably as good as it gets in Athens."

По прибытию из аэропорта на выходе со станции метро нас встретили, заселили, дали карты города со всеми достопримечательностями, показали самые вкусные ресторанчики и пекарни, где нам очень понравилось. Ответили на все наши вопросы и даже разрешили оставить у себя на хранение часть наших вещей, когда мы уезжали в другую часть страны. Квартира очень удачно расположена, рядом магазины, кафе, остановка метро, трамваев, автобусов. До Акрополя 10 минут хотьбы по приятному району. В комнатах чисто, убираются каждый день. Стены украшают чудесные рисунки, которые Тамара рисовала собственноручно. У квартиры так же есть огромный общий балкон с видом на гору Филопапу. Мы чувствовали себя очень уютно и по домашнему. Спасибо!!"
13860639,108907850,2016-10-18,53644352,Nandita,"A very comfortable stay. Tamara gave us the directions, came to pick us up at the metro station and gave us trips of things to do. It apt is very close to Plaka and acropolis which is a major advantage."

<br/>Peu de contact avec Tamara, un peu le sentiment d'être reçu à la va vite.
<br/>Sinon le logement est moyen et surtout très vide, par exemple trois locataires et deux fauteuil sur la terrasse.
<br/>La photo correspond exactement à la pièce rien de plus.
<br/>Le quartier est très bien situé."

She also showed me around the streets and goof food. We have nice talk! Her place is good too, near metro station, 15 min walk to acropolis, very convenient to center and the airport. Look forward to see you next time!"

She was there to welcome me and show me to the apartment when I arrived in Athens, but most impressively, she went out of her way to buy me medicine and a small hot tub for my feet after I caught a cold on my last day there. She acted just like my Mom would've, and I really appreciated her care. As for the apartment, it was very clean, quiet, well equipped, and well situated. Only about a 12 minute walk to the Acropolis Museum, and close to a really nice neighborhood and metro station. Would definitely go back, thanks Tamara! :) "

The apartment is centrally located, very clean with cosy rooms. There is lots of space and the atmosphere is very Greek. You get a feeling of being in a home away from home. Tamara has been an excellent host, picking us up from the metro station and sharing with us her knowledge of the city. Would definitely stay here again."

13860639,115360266,2016-11-24,91786158,Rohit,"Around 45 kilometers away from Athens airport. A day before Tamara suggested me to come by a metro. it took around 45 minutes to reach to the nearest metro station which is Sygrou Fix. the moment we came out from metro station, Thoe(Tamara's Boyfriend) was already waiting for us. just 3 to 4 minute walking distance to tamara's apartment. 
<br/>
<br/>Thoe has given us a brief of locality so good that we realised next day those were so important for us. 
<br/>
<br/>About the flat, it is on the third floor with everything one would need to stay there. you can cook there and use anything and everything. 
<br/>
<br/>What I like the most about the apartment was it was near to Acropoli and Syntagma. you just walk around and you don't need to hire any taxi, and not even metro and tram. 
<br/>
<br/>And what can I say about Tamara, the one thing I can say, come to India and I would like you to stay at my house :) 
<br/>Me and my wife really enjoyed everything and We hope next year Tamara and Thoe you will definitely get married :P

<br/>All the best"

Tamara and her boyfriend Theo were very kind in explaining all the surroundings and amenities and in meeting me at the metro. The house is nice and it has a beautiful big terrace to enjoy breakfast in the sun. Just mind that (as unfortunately many houses is Athens) the apartment is not super well equipped with heaters. So during the evenings in winter season, it might be a bit cold in the house. No problem at all I guess in summer and spring season, instead! <br/>In short, very good price/quality ratio, super kind and caring host, excellent position both to the centre and from airport.

I and my boyfriend spent a beautiful time in Athens and I am very happy that we chose Tamara's flat for our stay. The location is perfect, few minutes walk to Acropola, 3 minutes to metro and tram station (because we took the tram to go to the seaside), so it is possible to move everywhere very quickly. And the location is quiet and I felt that is also safe compared to some other places which we visited. I would like to also add that our flight was delayed and we came at midnight and Tamara was waiting for us with smile, she recommended us what we can visit, where we can go to eat and so on. We used Airbnb for the 1th time and for us it was a perfect experience."

По близости есть продуктовые магазины.<br/>При заселении нас втретили у метро и проводили до квартиры, а так же проконсультировали по разным вопросам прибывания в Афинах. Рекомендуем."
13860639,154508931,2017-05-25,1947058,Jessica,"Tamara's apartment is a great loctaion, easily walkable to all the sights. Tamara and her boyfriend were very helpful, meeting me at the train station, and giving lots of tips on things to do and how to get around. Overall a great stay and I would stay here again. "
13860639,155356392,2017-05-28,29893300,Jessica,"Theo was really nice , he's waiting for us in the metro to take us to the place (which is very close , 5 minutes walking)<br/>Everything was very clean , the location is excellent and the price is very good as well. The only issue, and that's why I'm not giving 5 stars , is the shower. We spent 2 days there, and on the 2 days my shower was super freezing, like REALLY freezing. They have a boiler for the building, but we didn't know the best time to take it , so unfortunately, it was very uncomfortable.<br/>Apart from that everything was great!"
13860639,156596389,2017-05-31,51913870,Mengya,"房子在市中心,走路到卫城只要10分钟,非常方便,房东人很好"

Жилье на спокойной улице, оч близко метро и супермаркет, и остановка в автобусом до пляжа. Квартира очень чистая, все есть, плюс огромный балкон! Тамара, спасибо тебе за гостеприимство и готовность ответить на любые вопросы! "
13860639,158003521,2017-06-05,57070738,Gerry,"Very friendly host and great communication. Her partner met us at the subway station and provided us with all the info for apartment, restaurants etc. Fluent in English and very knowledgeable. Simple and clean apartment. 10 minute walk to Acropolis and 3 minute walk to subway station. Large bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and balcony. Highly recommended!"
13860639,159508645,2017-06-11,67099562,Amélie,I highly recommand this airbnb since it's well situated to visit Athen only by walking. The host were really attentioned and met us at the metro ( super easy to get there in metro from the airport). The appartment is around 10-15 min from the accropolis. The only inconvenient was that the bed isn't really comfy.
13860639,160441016,2017-06-14,9548283,Ksenia,"Все было отлично! Тамара была очень гостеприимной, а жильё чистое и просторное. "
13860639,162050243,2017-06-19,34119019,Susanne,"Die Lage der Unterkunft ist sehr gut. Ein wunderbarer Ausgangspunkt um die Innenstadt zu erkunden. Ich fand schön, dass die Wohnung so viel Platz geboten hat, großes Wohnzimmer, Küche und Bad. Besonders gut fand ich auch den großen Balkon. Wunderbar um draußen zu frühstücken und sogar groß genug um dort Yoga zu machen. Tamara ist eine sehr engagierte und freundliche Gastgeberin."
13860639,162499056,2017-06-21,2743728,Katie,This place was perfect! It was close to everything but also in its own neighborhood so there were restaurants that didn't seem very touristic. Tamara's boyfriend picked us up from the train station and was so helpful showing us a map of where to go - restaurants as well as places to see. The apartment is great. The room was a good size and the porch was huge to eat breakfast in the morning or drinks at night. The other travelers staying in the remaining bedrooms were great too. Highly recommend this place to stay!
13860639,167230383,2017-07-06,56004776,David,Die Unterkunft liegt sehr zentral und ist schnell und einfach zu erreichen. Die Kommunikation und Absprachen mit Tamara haben einwandfrei funktioniert. Die Wohnung entspricht voll und ganz der Beschreibung und hat ein super Preis-Leistungsverhältnis.<br/>Einziger Verbesserungsvorschlag wäre vielleicht auch im Orange-Room eine Klima Anlage. Zu dem Preis aber auch ohne top.
13860639,168780460,2017-07-10,53499122,Antonia,"we had a great time in Athens and that also was because the apartment was great. The communication with Tamara worked perfectly and the the apartment was easy to reach from the airport, very clean and had a great balcony. <br/>Kitchen, bathroom and living room were clean and well equipped as well. Because there are 3 more rooms to rent, we also had the pleasure of meeting nice people from all over the world. <br/>Really, everything was perfect, the only disadvantage was the bed which was quite uncomfortable because but better in the other rooms (the others let us test haha). <br/>Anyways, we would definitely recommend this place and would stay here again during our next trip to Athens. "
13860639,169688212,2017-07-13,99445651,Vena,The location is very good. Exactly locating in the centre. 10-15mins walk to Acropolis. 4 mins walk to metro/bus station. 1hr and 10mins from the airport by metro. Tamara has been very helpful with the transportation from the airport. Her boyfriend came and met me at the metro station. Both of them are very friendly! This place is worth the value!
13860639,170718529,2017-07-16,39413829,Sarah,"One of my best airbnb experiences. Fantastic location, close to all attractions and plenty of great restaurants. Clean and spacious, as pictured. Great for solo travellers. Tamara went above and beyond, answering any questions and even taking me to the seaside. Highly reccommend!"
13860639,173831344,2017-07-24,101832474,Gerardo,"La situación estaba bien. Cerca de ahí, cruzando la gran avenida, encontramos dos plazas muy animadas y con precios normales para no turistas<br/> Ahí comimos y bebimos muy bien. Sin embargo, la habitación nos.pareció pequeña y lo de no tener aire acondicionado es muy importante en verano... el ventilador no quita el calor"
13860639,179988231,2017-08-09,15670307,Eva,I had a great stay in the Orange Room. My late arrival wasn't a problem. Tamara's boyfriend picked me up from the metro station and indicated the nice places in the area. The neighborhood is very quiet but with enough bars and restaurants. And just a short walk to the Akropolis. It had a perfect guide with the most important information about transport and tourist sites. And it was very clean and complete. Thanks so much!
13860639,183068046,2017-08-16,51423095,Diego,"I stayed in Tamara's place from Aug 14th-16th and everything was excellent. She was always aware of my arrival to her place, she also offered herself to pick me up at the metro station. The place is lovely and very big with a great terrace. Her boyfriend also was very good and advised us in what to do and some local stuff that was really helpful. Excellent host with an excellent place. Very recommended!"
13860639,184658348,2017-08-20,12383113,Gabriela,"Even though I didn't meet Tamara in person, she was great. She gave us all the info to take the public bus to Sounion, and communication was good. The room is good, perfectly located in a quiet residential area 20 min walking to Acropolis. It was summer so the only annoyance is no A.C. (but it's described here, just be aware of it if you're going in the summer). I def recommend it and would stay here again."
13860639,188034486,2017-08-28,109272019,Sadie,"Tamara的公寓在地铁边,走路5分钟,来之前就跟我很好的沟通,包括机场的时间等｡她让她男朋友到地铁站接我,把所有一切都考虑好了,太感动了｡<br/>最后一晚,她们还允许我把行李存在客厅里,太棒了｡房间很干净,有需要的一切,总之,不要错过这里!五颗星推荐!"
13860639,190822746,2017-09-05,127392100,Lisa,"Der Aufenthalt bei Tamara verlief super. Wir würden wie besprochen von ihrem Freund an der Metro abgeholt und zur Wohnung gebracht. Nach einer kleinen Wohnungstour würden uns noch viele nützliche Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt gegeben.<br/>Die Lage war wie beschrieben top und die Zimmer sauber.<br/>Einziges Manko war leider das doch sehr harte Bett. Auch die Federn könnte man deutlich durch den Bezug spüren.<br/>Ein kleiner Tipp von uns, darauf achten das man eines der Zimmer mit Klimaanlage wählt, in Sommer bei über 30 Grad (auch nachts teilweise) ist dies sehr hilfreich!<br/>Fazit: wir sind super zufrieden und können es nur weiterempfehlen."
13860639,193101352,2017-09-12,41626741,Marina,The apartment is really nice. We didn't have the chance to meet Tamara because we arrived late at night but she gave us the explanations that took us to the apartment. The room was very clean and she left some clean towels for us. We didn't spend many time there because we wanted to visit athens in one day but i would recommend it 100%. It's very close to the Acrópolis by walk and It has a lot of restaurants near.
13860639,194592959,2017-09-17,30566748,Mariano,Excelente ubicacion en atenas.
13860639,197590193,2017-09-26,11196060,Jens,Gute Kommunikation. Tolle Lage. Metro in direkter Nähe. Könnte ein wenig sauberer sein. Zu empfehlen. Vielen Dank noch einmal.
13860639,198066891,2017-09-28,21699608,Matt,"Tamara was great, friendly and accommodating from the start as was the market where she left her keys for my late check in. Another guest at the house gave me an exotic gift and from the first night I was off with local recommendations thanks to Tamara and had a wonderful time at the place! It was perfect, so close to transportation from the airport and to the acropolis, etc. I can't wait to go back to Athens to see the anarchist neighborhood Exarcheia again which I didn't quite get in this time as I was so busy in the core."
13860639,200097887,2017-10-04,83866968,Yanan,The location is very convenient and Tamara is very considerate! I'd love to stay here again!

13860639,215355723,2017-11-29,74711477,Cornelia,Great location and good price. Teo met me at the metro station and was super friendly and explained everything I needed to know. Athens was gorgeous.

13860639,222256118,2017-12-29,127564001,Jaime,"The flat is near to the principal tourist attractions. It very near to metro and tram station. Also as I am vegan the flat is near to a vegan restaurant (Peas). So, it was good stay there."
13860639,224484602,2018-01-03,25978586,Monika,"Mieszkanie 3pokojowe plus wspolny salon i duży taras. Dostepne suszarka, kawa,herbata i reczniki:) w salonie sporo przewodnikow i mapek, świetny kontakt z gospodarzem. Spokojna okolica."
13860639,225341815,2018-01-06,20640263,Emilia,"All good and as described, communication with Teo was super smooth, he answered the messages immediately and then waited for me at the metro station to show me the way to the apartment. You can get anywhere in the centre by foot (Acropolis is like 10min walk away) and there are some eateries around - although haven't found any really local one. Contemporary art musem is just few steps away. The hosts don't live there, but drop by sometimes and chat with guests for a while."
13860639,229173433,2018-01-22,154295615,Dido,Супер място! Благодарим!
13860639,230844811,2018-01-29,167035760,Marta,"Jesteśmy bardzo zadowoleni z pobytu w tym miejscu. Lokalizacja naprawdę super - wszędzie dało się dojść pieszo, gospodarz Teo bardzo uczynny, pomocny i niezwykle szybko odpisywał na wiadomości. Dodatkowym atutem była niewygórowana cena za pokój oraz dostęp do kawy, herbaty. Jedyny mały minus, mimo włączonego grzejnika, było za zimno w pokoju. "
13860639,232777005,2018-02-06,28005733,Ela,"Very well organized flat, everything was perfectly clean and well labeled. Teo was extremely helpful, though he couldn’t come with us to the flat (probably because we arrived at 1), he left us precise directions on how to get there without a problem. Absolutely would recommend :)"

The apartment is very good located, all attractions and transportation stations are within walking distance. Definitely will stay next time"

13860639,239099889,2018-02-28,172336571,Len,Teo's place is well positioned for site seeing and also with plenty of places to eat out.<br/>It's a third floor flat which means four flights of stairs - quite an effort for an OAP!<br/>The smallest room was the one that I stayed in which would fine for a couple of days but lack of storage space meant that it wasn't ideal for a full week - the other two rooms both had plenty of storage space and direct access to balconies.
13860639,239829475,2018-03-03,105181317,Keshal,So hospitable and resourceful when it came to figuring out how to plan my days in Athens. Even provided a map!
13860639,240786459,2018-03-06,161072354,Stephanie,"This was a great stay. It’s very close to the Metro, and within walking distance of the main attractions. Teo was very friendly and made sure I knew where I was going and made arrangements for a key pick-up when he couldn’t meet me. It was a great place to relax after a long day in Athens. I would definitely stay here again :)"

The bed and blankets comfortable. Hot water 24/7! Good wifi. Also really great information on how to get around the city, i.e. public transportation options and important stops. Thanks for a wonderful stay!"

13860639,255035748,2018-04-19,58800692,Julia,"Two nights in the apartment in mid April- perfect time of year to be in Athens!  We arrived by metro from the airport, easy check in (quite late in the evening) and we were able to walk everywhere from the apartment.  Met some lovely other guests staying on the other rooms too.  Highly recommend the restaurant a few blocks away called Kalabaki and the bakeries (Attica) across from Fix for breakfast.  Thanks for an easy stay in Athens!"
13860639,256960168,2018-04-24,173897668,Rebecca,Great place near all the sites like acropolis and Athens market!
13860639,258520186,2018-04-29,44856902,Gauthier,"Everything will be as described and we did not meet any problem.<br/>All was cleaned, the little kitchen is well equipped for small preparation, the location is perfect (no far away Plaka or Acropolis) and good communication with us.<br/>The service worth the price. We recommand it for a short stay."
13860639,259528905,2018-05-01,12753687,Noémie,The apartment is simple and perfectly located. 15min walking from the Plaka neighbourhood. There is a nice balcony. Teo is really available to give advice.
13860639,262272032,2018-05-08,143135841,Riku,"The place is on a quiet street. Public transport is close, but you can also just walk to most any of the attractions from this place with no issues. Teo seems extremely nice and very helpful with things you need or might need to know about conserning your trip. We were to arrive by train and metro from airport, but coulnd't because there was a Labor Day strike or such, and Teo informed us about this well ahead with new instructions how to reach the place by bus from the airport. The Orange Room where we stayed at was alright. The views out of the balcony or windows aren't anyhing to rave about, but you can see some things like Philopappos monument and part of Acropolis, I think. :) The Orange Room had one somewhat sizable flaw however, the bed is pretty bad. Spring mattress with basically no cushion just layer of fabric on the springs, if you sleep on your side the springs will dig into your ribs. I already suggested getting a mattress topper for it as soon as possible to hugely improve this room. This room doesn't have an aircon so it most likely is very hot at summertime as it was already now in May. Our fresh towels had a few stains on them which I don't like particularly much. Kitchen is alright, didn't really use it but seemed quite decent. Bathroom is ok, some mold in between the tiles but nothing to be alarmed about. Water temperature doesn't fluctuate and good pressure. The space in the bathtub where you stand to take a shower is very limited, and you will most likely experience the shower curtain trying adhere itself on you a few times. If you are a large and or tall person be prepared to have some cumbersome time in the shower. One thing some people might not be happy about, and which should be mentioned in the descriptions of the rooms, is that inside the apartment all the keys open all the doors. So your rooms key will open the bathroom, and other guests rooms as well. I noticed how simple the keys looked and wondered about it, so when other guests had checked out and left their keys on the livingrooms table, I tried that key on our rooms door and it worked fine. I still felt secure, there is still the outside doors lock to the building, and main lock to the apartment, so only people who could access your room when you are away are the other guests. I just wanted to inform people who might not find this to be ok. There was an incident which made me quite mad in the middle of the night which was not good and it could have been avoided. Other guests who stayed in the other room had gone out middle of the night, I assumed checked out, but somehow still needed to come back yet they had already left their keys..."
13860639,263485310,2018-05-12,153800797,Daniela,"Tuvimos una buena estadía, se encuentra cerca de las atracciones turísticas, el anfitrión muy atento y amable. Recomendado."

13860639,278475951,2018-06-18,54322793,John Paul,"First off, Teo is a very accommodating host. Our arrival in Athens was quite late in the evening and yet, Teo managed to meet us during the check-in and orient us about the flat and everything about the tourist spots in the city. The place is accurate as what is described in the description. About 5-7 mins walk from the nearest train station and located in a quiet neighborhood. The flat is well equipped with all the basic necessities and is clean and tidy as well. I highly recommend Teo and his flat and we will definitely book again when we visit Athens in the future. Cheers!"
13860639,279304046,2018-06-20,58841012,Mauricio,Tranquilo y buena ubicación
13860639,282320209,2018-06-27,20909821,Marie-Claude,Everything was perfect. We arrived during the night and Teo did everything to make us feel secure and confident about how to get to his place. The instructions and the self check in was easy. Perfect location to do everything we wanted to do by walking. Teo is super reachable and very helpful. Good communication. The only thing was the mattress not super comfy as we felt the springs inside but everything else was more than perfect. Very quiet place but amazing location in the middle of everything. We highly recommand you to go there if you want to visit Athens. Thank you Teo for everything!
13860639,283045264,2018-06-29,190846558,Roberto Jordan,Buena ubicación y cordialidad de Teo. Ademas de comunicación constante ante cualquier duda.
13860639,284731692,2018-07-02,21449501,Bruna,En Teo va ser súper simpàtic i ens va venir a buscar al metro i ens va acompanyar fins a l’apartament. Ens va fer molt bones recomanacions per planejar la nostra estada a Atenes i també després a les illes. L’apartament és senzill però té tot el necessari per passar una molt bona estada. A 15 minuts a peu de l’Acropolis!! 100% recomanable
13860639,287468579,2018-07-08,39431173,Axel,Teo welcomed us very well and gave nice advices for the city.<br/><br/>The appartement is not far from center and functional. It s a good place for some days in athens.

13860639,292429145,2018-07-18,78622955,Arvinderan,"Indeed a great pick with public transports and restaurants just minutes away from the apartment. Plus, with just 10 mins walk to acropolis, the location is great."
13860639,293909775,2018-07-21,73127203,Kayla,"Good value and great location! Close to everything you would want to see while in Athens. Our flight was delayed and the hosts set up an alternative check in for us and provided updated transit information because we were arriving so late at night. That really helped us and saved us from paying through the roof for a taxi from the airport. In summer, the room is extremely hot (but we were aware before there was no AC). The bed is a little lumpy but it was fine. The balcony is really nice! Perfect for a tourist stay in Athens. "

13860639,296518745,2018-07-26,92225796,Ritesh,the place is exceptionally well located with all major attractions within walkable distance. The metro station is also very close so perfect for commuting. the flat is clean and well maintained while the kitchen had all required amenities. had a very plesant and comfortable stay and highly recommended for all traveling to athens.

13860639,304238870,2018-08-09,141726179,Sandra,"Wir waren eine Woche in der Unterkunft. Für uns die perfekte Reisedauer. <br/>Die Kommunikation mit Teo lief ideal. Er hat uns immer sofort geantwortet und uns super Tipps gegeben und ging auf unsere Wünsche ein. Wir hatten das Glück ihn sogar persönlich kennen zulernen!<br/>Die Lage des Apartments ist zentral angebunden an den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln und zu Fuß in 10-15 min. alles erreichbar.<br/>Die Wohnung wird ausschließlich nur von Airbnb Gästen genutzt, dh. man lernt viele  Menschen aus diversen Ländern kennen. Wir haben unsere Mitgäste aber selten gesehen...<br/>Ein kleiner Tipp von uns: wenn ihr wie wir im Hochsommer nach Athen reist, dann bucht nicht das Orange Zimmer. Es ist für 2 Personen bei solch einer Hitze, zu klein und stickig. Die anderen Zimmer haben Klimaanlagen, das Orange Zimmer keine! Wir mussten immer mit offener Tür + Fenster + Balkontür schlafen, damit die Luft etwas zirkuliert. Von den anderen Gästen wurden wir aber nie deswegen gestört, weil wir immer relativ spät Heim kamen.<br/>Von der Ausstattung der Wohnung aber durchschnitt für ein fremdes Land, da hatten wir keine großen Erwartungen!"

Esperamos que puedan repararlo o cambiarlo para los futuros huéspedes. De ser así, lo recomiendo 100%"

Also the apartment includes a balcony which is wonderful to sit on and have breakfast for example. The bathroom is a little old and worn down but it was fine for us and if you can overlook this small inconvenience you will be rewarded with an apartment in top location. Keep in mind that you will be sharing kitchen, bathroom and the living room with up to four other guests. On the other hand the hosts are very flexible and communication worked perfectly. Have fun in Athens!"

13860639,340179939,2018-10-23,5038494,Carlos,"This is a kind of micro hostel, with 3 or 4 different rooms with people inside and some common areas. It can be good or bad, depending who you meet. Also it can get tricky to take a shower depending on the people inside the apartment.<br/><br/>Good location in a local neighbourhood, it’s not right in the middle of the action but is possible to walk to the main sights in 15-30 minutes. Close to some good local restaurants,  in a good area and less than 10 minutes walking to the nearest metro station. The Room and the bed are good and clean, but the bathroom is quite old and run down, I didn’t feel comfortable having a shower. Overall good value for money. <br/><br/>Be careful with the keys, the door from the vestibule gets closed at night and you’ll need them to be able to go out on the street"

13860639,419610067,2019-03-04,19764856,Emily,This apartment was as described and very central. My only comments would be that the bed is described as king size when it is a small double/queen at best. Also the room is right next to the bathroom which you share with other guests - this is quite noisy at night and we were kept up by the other guests coming in late at night. Otherwise though it’s a great location to explore central Athens and the apartment was clean. Teo was very helpful with directions and came to meet us at the metro station.

Also we did not see him in our 4 days in Athens. Unfortunately the flat was not what we expected. The room was much smaller, no aircon, uncomfortable pillows and bed. The bathroom was always wet, the toilet dirty and it was difficult to shower due to some kind of problems with the faucet.  The frige was really old, we only used  it to put a bottle of water and it did not cool. There were holes in the walls in the bathroom. The chairs in the balcony were broken so we could not use them and one of the fans was not working. The flat is reallllly old and not extremely clean."

13860639,512266524,2019-08-18,19358931,Eliana,"The best thing about the apartment is that it is located 15 minutes walking from the Acropolis and the city centre. The bedroom is small (but it is ok for a couple of nights) and you share the common areas and toilet with other guests staying in two additional rooms. The host does not live there and, despite his efforts, the overall experience is affected by that. Even though he makes available to the guests information about the city (eg maps, fliers), it is always better to have a real person to talk to."

Direkt und die Ecke ist ein Coffee und Snack Shop das war super praktisch und die Leute dort waren sehr nett. <br/>Das Apartment insgesamt ist groß, das Orange Zimmer eher klein. Die Matratze ist nichts für Menschen mit Rückenproblemen. Man konnte das Zimmer anschließen das fand ich gut. Es war alles nicht besonders Komfortabel aber es war ein guter Preis. Die Umgebung ist eher laut als leise, also wenn man da empfindlich ist eher nicht machen."

But during my stay I experience power outage for 2 consecutive mornings that I stayed there. So imagine taking a shower with cold water, which was a big deal for me. It was also a bit far walk from Monastiraki. 23-25mins but it was an enjoyable walk because of the shops and it was safe anyway."

13860639,575997073,2019-12-12,1200465,Bonnie,"This is a very basic place, shared with 2 other guests in a fairly decent area from what I could tell, with  convenience stores nearby and the nearest bus / underground about 10 mins walk though you do tend to wait for the buses for a while as some of them don't always show up. I walked almost everywhere though and you can get to the Acropolis in 30 mins by foot. Be prepared to hike up & down very steep uneven walkways/roads within the residential areas (common for Athens of course, but if you're not used to it, do take note!). <br/><br/>The building has an old style elevator which fits you and your suitcase or two/three people maximum - which I took only twice in 4 days. There is no light that I could see anywhere for the staircase so at night expect to use your flashlight to navigate as it's pitch black inside. <br/><br/>My room was the first on the left as you come in - it has a mirror, shelving unit, end table, very basic bed and half a blind on the window with the other half only covered by a sheer curtain which I found not the best for sleeping in the morning as it was a bit bright and I really need darkness - so bring a face mask. I had issues with the heating which I was told wasn't working (central heating that is) due to the greek crisis...and the heater on timer in the room was practically not working either so I was pretty cold the whole time but managed to get an extra blanket brought to me the next day after mentioning it to Teo.  I would still suggest bringing a thick sweater! <br/><br/>I spent no time in the common area - it had a hostel feel - very simple with a coffee table and small sofa and chair. There's a terrace but it wasn't the weather for it at all and the kitchen served the basic need though could have been cleaner as could the bathroom tub. <br/><br/>Teo suggested a great restaurant called Kalamaki Bar which I ate at twice as it was really good and decent prices - and only 10 mins walk from the place. Highly recommended! (Website hidden by Airbnb)"

Mais forcément avec un prix bas les prestations le sont aussi, la salle de bain n’est pas propre (tapis de bain noir, baignoire sale) et il y a des traces de moisissures au plafond. La salle de bain est un point important et cette dernière devrait être rénovée. La chambre est correct mais le lit peu confortable. A savoir que cet appartement n’est pas occupé par le propriétaire  mais seulement par des Airbnb (3 chambres). De mon point de vue pour quelques euros de plus vous pouvez obtenir bien mieux... pour les petits budgets c’est parfait"
13860639,599485266,2020-01-30,34992506,Anna,"Очень удобное расположение. Рядом метро и транспорт почти в любую точку города.  До порта очень удобно добираться. До Акрополя минут 10-12 спокойным шагом. Большая тераса, есть необходимый набор посуды. В целом очень неплохо."

13860639,647156584,2020-08-06,193022458,Sina,"The communication with Tamara and Teo was very fast and they agreed to my very spontaneous booking, which was kind! The appartment is simple, the room is small but all fine (orange room), the bathroom is old and a bit runned down - especially the ceiling and the toilet would need renovation. The balcony is nice, as well as the simple little kitchen. The bed wasn't too comfy as it has an old spring mattress, which you will feel during your sleep.<br/>Some furniture on the balcony was broken, but for the price in a central location like this, you probably can't ask for more. Attention: Room doesn't have a AC,  just a fan! But Teo and Tamara will warn you about this prior to your booking, I guess :)<br/>Thanks for your flexibility, Teo :)"

13860639,662510224,2020-09-10,361686288,Márta,"The flat is at a really good location. The host is a ghost, he appeared only once during my staying though he did not introduce me. The check in wss stressful because he was not there. Though he gave me instructions what to do with some kind of lock in the street, a passenger had to help me with getting to the building. The flat has a georgous large balcony what is very comfortable. Sitting there l could feel like a local. The elevator was working properly so it  was not a problem to get to the 3rd floor. The place is elegant with very noisy neibourhood. The mattress was quite old and uncomfortable but the room was nice. The kitchen was too humble but l could eat on the balcony without any problem. There was wifi. Checking out was also stressful, because if you leave the key behind and someone lock the outside door, you will be a prisoner of the house. So that was also very unpleasant. The host is vety friendly and communicative on the phone and emails but l missed his caring presence all the time during my staying."

13860639,667023340,2020-09-22,28456278,Tanja,"A budget place that has everything you need! I stayed at Teo's and Tamara's place for three nights and had a really good time there. My room was nice and comfy and the rest of the apartment was spacious with a big living room and a well-equipped kitchen. There's even a balcony where you can sit and have your breakfast. Check-in was easy - I didn't meet Teo, but he left the key for me at a little corner shop and everything worked out perfectly. The location is good, too - the apartment is located in a quiet, residential area, however, the Acropolis and all the tourist attractions are in walking distance. This place isn't fancy but you get amazing value for very little money. I can definitely recommend it."

And, very remarkably, because it wouldn't fit in the elevator and I needed to keep it safe one night, Teo carried up the three flights of stairs an e-bike I rented in Athens which weighed maybe 50 pounds!  The next morning he carried it back down.  I'm still amazed at this.  He thought nothing of it.  I would definitely stay there again."

<br/>
<br/>Aris welcomed us at the apartment  and gave us advice on places to visit which I don't think we would have discovered otherwise; Especially the rooftop bars which had an outstanding view of the Acropolis!
<br/>
<br/>The neighbourhood itself has some amazing restaurants all serving traditional Greek dishes. There are also shops nearby if you need to stock up on food or toiletries. 
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures, very clean and provided plenty of room for the 3 of us to comfortably fit. 
<br/>
<br/>I would have no hesitation in recommending to others, thanks for a great stay!

13872360,112416407,2016-11-06,15088695,Qi,"Love the place, clean and convenient with a really modern design. I had a really late check in a and opted for a pick up from the airport by taxi with extra payment, but it was worth it for the great planning and convenience. I would highly recommend this place for anyone coming to Athens."

13872360,117279245,2016-12-06,11369017,Judith,"Wir haben Aris an der Wohnung getroffen. Es gab erst ein kleines Missverständnis über den Ort des Treffpunkts, aber alles kein Thema. Aris war super nett, hat uns die Wohnung gezeigt, alles erklärt und uns ein paar Empfehlungen für Besichtigungen und Restaurants gegeben.
<br/>Die Wohnung ist genauso, wie auf den Fotos, sie liegt im dritten Stock und super nah an der Akropolis. Sehen kann man diese aber nicht. Einzig aufgefallen ist uns, dass die Betten sehr weiche Matratzen haben. Das ist einfache Frage des Geschmacks; wir schlafen lieber auf härteren Betten, aber alles war sauber und in Ordnung.
<br/>Direkt um die Ecke gibt es ein tolles kleines griechisches Familienrestaurant ""El Greco"" - das können wir nur empfehlen.  Der Supermarkt ebenfalls nah bei hat bis 23:00 Uhr geöffnet, der Bäcker daneben war auch top - Achtung: Sonntags geschlossen.
<br/>Das Viertel ist angenehm und wir haben uns sicher gefühlt. Es ist aber recht laut, wie überall in der Stadt durch den vielen Verkehr.
<br/>In Summe würden wir den Aufenthalt in dieser Wohnung mit dem Eazybnb Team weiterempfehlen."

It looks even better then the pictures and everything was provided and clean! They gave us the best tips for restaurants and must sees - like the 360 rooftop bar with a view over Akropolis. The appartment has 2 small balcony's where we had breakfast every morning. From 1 balcony you can see Akropolis! And everything was only 10 min walk. Akropolis is even shorter, let's say 4-5 min walk! We stayed for 7 nights and the neighbourhood and everything was so nice that we didn't wanna leave. If we ever go back to Athene we are definitely trying to rebook this appartment! "

It is very conveniently located at a 5 minutes' walk from Akropoli Metro station, the Acropolis Museum and the Parthenon. It is on the edge of Plaka with plenty of restaurants and the shops around the corner. Even Syntagma Square is at a walkable distance.<br/><br/>The apartment is really a very nice option for those who want to be very near to a buzzing part of Athens, with all basic needs in a convenient place.<br/><br/>Also fro families it is easy to stay there, with a double bed for the parents and separate beds for the children."

The apartment is centrally located and easily within walking distance to Athen's main attractions. It's also extremely close to restaurants and bars and safe at night. The apartment is very clean and was everything we were looking for in terms of location and comfort. The hosts are extremely professional.

You're five minutes from the Acropolis Museum. I liked that there was an air conditioning unit in both the living room and the bedroom. There was also lots of natural light. There's two small elevators in the building for bringing up luggage, and a balcony overlooking the street, which is quiet.  Great place and very hospitable hosts. Would recommend!"

13872360,320118626,2018-09-08,21544763,Marisol,The Eazybnb Team facilitated a taxi ride from the airport to the Airbnb address. They also allowed early checkin permitting we store our luggage while they cleaned and prepared the stay for us due to previous guests. The place is tastefully decorated and it’s in such close proximity to the Acropolis area. We easily walked to many restaurants and all the historic landmarks. Plus they left a booklet with great wine and dining recommendations. We did not ever feel in danger and there were so many nearby places opened late. I would recommend this place if you’re planning to visit Athens.
13872360,321305283,2018-09-10,25066362,Eliza,The apartment is beautiful and the location is perfect!

The bathroom was also poorly lit because a fused light hadn’t been replaced. Otherwise though the flat is a great place to stay if you’re keen to explore Athens."

She booked the taxi for us on arrival and on departure and gave us really good tips, specially about the bakery near the apartment which was excellent. However, we had some little disappointments about the apartment. The TV room’s floor was very dirty, there was a lot of dust under our feet when we first walked with no shoes on. The bathroom is small and dark. The hanger of the shower was broken and it couldn’t hold the shower at height, so we had hold it with one hand and clean ourselves with the other. Also, the shower courtains were very dirty and had a really sour smell. They should buy a new one asap and fix the shower hanger."
13872360,326369312,2018-09-22,30129227,Sruthi,We had a pleasant stay at Eazybnb's place. Great location. The team also helped us with setting up pick up and drop off to the airport which was really helpful for us.

Everything was exactly as described -the appartment is comfortable, good equiped and really perfectly located! A minor problem occured with the shower hang, and the clothes hang in front of the bathroom, but I hope it will be fixed soon. Giorgina is very responsive. She arranged a taxi to the airport for us at the arrival and at the departure (for 38€) and it was really helpful. Also she provided us with a local sim card - that was very nice, though we did not use it. There is a good restaurant El Greco near the appartment, a mini supermarket where you can find everything a traveller might need and especially not to miss the best bakery ever!

The toilet did not work for the first 24h of our stay, the heating only works late in the day and one of the wall heaters makes a constant dripping sound, the shower fixture is broken so the shower wand must be held, the microwave didn’t work, and the kitchen had half-used food and dirty mugs, plates, etc from a previous stay.<br/><br/>Despite all this, Giorgina was a very responsive host who quickly arranged for fixes where she could. She arranged an airport transfer for us which was a great touch, and has prepared a local guide that came in handy."

Четвертый раз отдыхали с их помощью и, как всегда, отлично.  Каждый раз нам обеспечивают встречу в аэропорту с такси, каждый раз предлагают такси в аэропорт, всегда в апартаментах лежит сделанный руками команды путеводитель по Афинам, в котором все - от музеев до ресторанов и рекомендаций. Каждый раз есть краткая инструкция с описанием необходимого в районе апартаментов - кафе, магазины, аптеки. <br/>В этот раз мы жили на Роверто Галли. Чистая, светлая, современная квартира со всем необходимым. 2-3 минуты до Акрополя, музея Акрополя и одноименной станции метро, 7-10 минут до Плаки, 15-20 - до Синтагмы, в другую сторону 15 минут до Тесео и дальше к Монастираки. Как всегда, хлопковое постельное белье и мягкие полотенца.<br/>Вокруг дома много кафешек (одно кафе вообще в том же доме) и продуктовых магазинов. Все есть, все рядом, все удобно.<br/>Обязательно посмотрите закат на Ареопаге :) И доверьтесь Eazebnb Team"

We did not have a car for our stay and I would not suggest one, parking near the apartment was very minimal.  Upon arrival the team attached a ride for us. It may have been more expensive than a taxi, but I would recommend it. The driver met us inside the airport, took us to house and helped us settle in early. Thanks Giorgina for your excellent hospitality and opening up your lovely apartment!"

She mapped out a bunch of locations for us to check out during our stay in Athens and answered any questions we had. The apartment itself was clean, well-decorated, and equipped with the essentials. There's even a washer for those interested in doing their laundry."
13872360,518044531,2019-08-26,4754202,Cindy,"My husband, adult son and I really enjoyed our stay at the apartment, which is very well located.  It was an easy walk one Sunday morning to the Acropolis, and the apartment is just down the street from the Acropolis Museum.  The people at the Mint Team made good recommendations and we greatly appreciated the professional and kind drivers with whom they arranged our transfers.  The apartment itself was clean and comfortable.  The beds were good and the AC was amazing.  We also highly recommend the restaurant next door-we had a great breakfast there."

13872360,531732438,2019-09-18,144235516,Maike,"Der Aufenthalt in Athen in so zentraler Lage war unglaublich. Die Akropolis ist nah aber das Akropolis Museum ist quasi nebenan. Von dort kann man viele Hotspots zu Fuß erreichen. Auch die Ausstattung des Airbnb war sehr stylisch und sauber. Man muss aber wissen dass direkt vor der Haustür alle Busse von Touristen zur Akropolis fahren und das sind nicht Wenige! Unabhängig davon haben wir uns sehr wohl gefühlt und können  können das Mint Team und ihr Airbnb auf jeden Fall weiter empfehlen. Die Kommunikation per Message war schnell, flexibel und freundlich. Gerne wieder"

13872360,549347489,2019-10-18,121361772,Caroline,"A great apartment in an excellent position right next to the main sites of Athens, allowing you to walk to most places you would want to visit. The accommodation is just as described and is clean and comfortable with everything you might need. The kitchen is fully equipped. There is a TV and WiFi. The hosts communicate well and answered all queries promptly, arranging a very smooth pick up and check in. There is a balcony to the street which is quite busy but then so is every street in Athens! .The tourist bus stops just down the road and the metro is very close by and easy to use. We would use this apartment again if we return to Athens."

13872360,556277903,2019-10-29,63740400,Luis,"This spot has a great location, close to bars, restaurants, souvenir stores. Property layout is great and we really enjoyed. To avoid a bitter experience, I would check the bedding cleanness and we had a bit of an issue with a leakage in the bathroom.<br/><br/>Other than that is a great place to stay that, if those features are fixed, we’d love to return, and we just might!"
13872360,562011846,2019-11-10,2568988,Lori,This apartment was very nice to stay in. It was very close to the metro. The sights of Athens were literally right out our front door. I highly recommend this place if you are wanting to stay in Athens for sightseeing. The team at Mint arranged a pick up for us at the airport directly to the front door!  This made arrival after 16 hours of travel very easy for us. I would stay here again if I come back to Athens.

13872360,390278085329451462,2021-06-22,371529340,Paul,"Very nice apartment. The pictures make it look bigger then it actually is. Also we had to walk and pick up the key for the apartment from this company’s office, which was like a 12min walk both ways from the apartment, which was a little frustrating with luggage and the athens heat. <br/>Very clean and modern apartment with a view of the acropolis."

A checkout we could leave the keys in the flat and just leave, which is very handy. I would gladly return to that place."
13872360,417121635653033360,2021-07-29,241305622,Mathis,"The appartement is incredible : perfectly situated in Athens, very comfortable with AC and an elevator. We were very pleased with the stay. For the check in, you have to get the keys at separate location (not too far away so not a big hassle) and the check-out is really easy, we were able to leave the keys in the appartement and leave quickly. I recommend."
13872360,419243046275410644,2021-08-01,46241572,Beti,"We have enjoyed the place, the appartment is very nice, incl. location. However in terms of the communication with Mint, here I have to say, having great comparison with many other places during our travel around Greece, it was a disappointing experience. Maybe because this is not a private owner or superhost but a company who probably has many appartments and guests like that. It all depends what you are looking for in terms of the AirBnB offer. Anyway, we asses the stay as good."

13872360,438158308679803299,2021-08-27,5045760,Giorgia,"We took the apartment for 18h in the city as stop over, and was perfect for our needs.<br/>Really next to the Acropolis museum, 2 minutes to the entrance of the Acropolis and so close if you would like to walk to plaka and monastiraki (beautiful neighbourhoods).<br/>Also, there is a market at the corner down the street which opens at 7:3am in case you need an early breakfast like us who offers coffee, cappuccino and something to eat.<br/>I would def recommend it!<br/><br/>My only cons was the communication with the host, being an agency you have more people interacting with you and some info were lost in between, like no crib for my newborn at the arrival, no sheets (bed ready) and towels for my 3years old and no baby seats on the way to the airport with the pick up organized, even though was mentioned we were 4 since day one.<br/>But for a night only was ok, no big deal."

Enjoy relaxing under the lemon trees of the garden listening to Antoni's jazz while drinking a delicious Greek coffee made with love by Froso!!! I totally recommend ! "
13874631,120174165,2016-12-08,1465693,Asimo,The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13874631,136521971,2017-03-11,11585646,Hanna,"We stayed here for two months and it was so wonderful! In a unique, quiet neighborhood, this flat has everything you need to LIVE in Athens. I have so many good things to say that it's hard to know where to start! Froso and Antoni are wonderful hosts, and they were extremely helpful. They drove us to the market so we could stock up on groceries, and showed us a great traditional local restaurant, in our first days there. They recommended interesting things to see and do, helped us make phone calls, and in general were like family. They even made us a feast in the outdoor oven, in true Greek style, complete with wine, music, and wonderful conversation.They let us pick lemons off the trees in the beautiful garden they've built. They taught us about the fascinating history of the neighborhood as well as shared wonderful stories of Antoni's days as a sailor. The house was truly a home away from home. Your own private entrance, on a quiet street, with no speeding traffic is a rare find in Athens. Although your hosts live upstairs, the flat is very private and they give you your space as you like it. If we wanted coffee they made it for us any morning we asked. The bed is so comfortable, the fireplace so cozy, the view of the acropolis, as you come home, stunning. We will absolutely stay here again, as we really appreciated this unpretentious, well equipped, down to earth, and friendly flat. The gorgeous neighborhood, with it's staircases, and marble tiled roads, were romantic and timeless. The easy access to the National Gardens, the First Cemetery, the forest surrounding the Panathenaic Stadium, and lovely garden, helped us feel at home as we aren't used to living in the city. This location is a short walk to these tranquil spots and to all of the sites, fabulous resturants, and museums that Athens has to offer. This was another great Airbnb experience! We highly recommend staying here!"
13874631,142027892,2017-04-06,11564848,Jaqueline,My daughter and me had a fantastic stay at Froso's home.<br/>They are such a friendly couple and were willing to help us with everything we could have needed.<br/>They showed us around the neighbourhood and even moved their own car so we can park in front of the door.<br/>In general we felt very welcome.<br/>Thank you both for everything and hopefully seer you again.
13874631,144019113,2017-04-14,616613,Amir,"Froso and Antoni are the warmest hosts and their house and yard are authentic, cosy and warm. The location is perfect - quiet, close to the center and to several nice bars and restaurants. A perfect Athenian experience! Highly recommend. "

13874631,149850091,2017-05-06,9870033,Constantinos,"Froso's place really makes you feel ""home"". It's very quite close to public transportation. Mets area is hilly but and you will have to climb up some public steps but it's one of the most beautiful districts in Athens.<br/>Froso's place is in a walking distance (5 min) from really cool bars, coffee shops, restaurants and (15 min) from Acropolis.<br/>Froso and her husband are very friendly and they know what hospitality means. The house is spacious and we enjoy our stay there! We defiantly recommend it!"
13874631,150783688,2017-05-09,7271515,Priya,"I came to athens for one night with my 2 friends on the way back from the islands and this could not have been a more perfect stay! We were greeted in the most friendly and welcoming way and this place felt like home from the second we walked in. The location is perfect, very close to the acropolis and amazing restaurants. Would HIGHLY recommend! "

There is lot of local bar and restaurant, cheep and youth, and without toutists. "
13874631,153504749,2017-05-21,69520420,Matt,"Located at the top of a hill within easy walking distance to the Plaka, Acropolis and main area for tourists.  Definitely a quiet neighborhood, with local establishments and a less hectic pace.<br/><br/>The house is very open and comfortable, with a functional kitchen where we made a couple of small meals.  The fridge and cupboards had some required items to get us through to our first shopping trip from the store just at the bottom of the flight of stairs outside.<br/><br/>Be prepared to enjoy Athens and get some walking in, then come home to a comfortable home on your trip!"
13874631,155428306,2017-05-28,1262155,Kris & Tamara,From the very beginning communication was excellent - quickly responding and helping with questions. Our taxi from the airport seemed to have trouble finding the house and I was able to get them on the phone to speak to the driver which helped a lot. <br/><br/>The house itself is lovely - the garden is amazing and if you're there for good weather they'll kick up the fire and do some bbqing. The apartment was perfect for us - one bedroom with a comfortable bed and a lounge area with a foldout bed for the kids. (I wouldn't want to sleep on the foldout but it worked for younger bones.) <br/><br/>We felt welcomed and comfortable during our stay and would definitely return if were in Athens again.
13874631,158938610,2017-06-09,24992684,Jonathan,"If Airbnb did awards for hospitality, Froso and Antoni would be awarded Gold.<br/>They made us feel so welcome, that we were actually sad to leave. <br/>The flat was huge and had everything you could ask for and more. <br/>Their cat would pay us a daily visit to make sure we had enough cuddles and meows, and would quiet happily curl up next to us on the sofa.<br/>The Location was fantastic, with a great local residential restaurant that fed us and most of the locals great food. Transport links were very close by. The neighbourhood was safe, friendly and welcoming.<br/>Froso and Antoni  cooked us an amazing feast on out last night, that wont be forgotten.<br/>Antoni has so much energy and was a real inspiration, and I felt like I'd met a real kindred spirit. He has the drive and vitality for life that is boundless. <br/>Froso and Antoni's garden/courtyard was breathtaking, individual and beautiful much like the hosts. <br/>I can not praise these lovely people enough.<br/><br/>"
13874631,160409313,2017-06-14,103350725,Chris,"Charming and spacious old house. It was hard to believe we were so close to the centre of Athens. You can have your privacy and sit in your own little outside terrace, or sit in the gorgeous bigger courtyard and enjoy the company of your hosts. I am not the fittest person in the world, but didn't find the walk back from Athens centre too much. Several neighbourhood cafe/bars and also a taverna serving home cooked food as well as as a pharmacy and several other shops only 3 mins walk away. with daily visits by Nefeli the cat it was like we had our own pet. Would we stay there again?  You bet we would!"

Amazing restaurant down the road that froso will send you to. Really was the best food we had in the whole of Athens! Traditional family restaurant no glamour just perfect! Some good coffee shops close by as well for breaky! Wish we could have stayed longer!!! "

I really appreciate your help with their check in. They found your apartment to be clean, comfortable, inviting and amazingly close to the Parthenon and all the local life. They said your gardens and the bonus addition of a kitty cat made it feel perfectly like a home away from home. Thank you so much for your help and warmth. We all really appreciated it."

Froso greeted us with coffee and biscuits when we checked in and was hospitable, flexible, and helpful throughout our entire stay. The apartment is spacious and cool in summer and the garden is a beautiful oasis where we sat and talked over coffee. The best airbnb experience I've had! Thank you Froso :-)"

13874631,183379395,2017-08-17,141229293,Rosie,"We couldn't have picked a better place to stay in Athens than with Froso and Antoni, and our time staying with them is something we will never forget. Froso is a wonderful host and is excellent with her response and communication time -- she is quick, helpful, and is very willing to help out her guests and to make your time spent in Athens at her flat as seamless as possible. Our flight was delayed several hours, yet Froso was wonderfully accommodating and understanding to our situation. Going above and beyond, she arranged our taxi for us back to the airport and ensured that it was on time. We were especially grateful for Froso's Greek coffee, which is absolutely delicious. She made us fresh coffee upon our arrival, and she woke up early with us upon departure to make us coffee once again. All in all, Froso was the perfect host, and we truly couldn't have asked for more. She is sweet, thorough, organized, and all around great. The pictures of the flat are exactly as described (seriously, down to the towel color!) and the flat is even more beautiful in person. It is extremely spacious, air conditioned in the bedroom, and just overall wonderful. The location is exceptional. It's about a 10-15 minute walk from downtown Plaka. Plaka is extremely busy and crowded, so we loved staying in Mets with Froso and Antoni outside of the central hustle and bustle. It's such an easy walk to the busy downtown areas, but it's so peaceful to be able to come home to a more quiet and peaceful area at the end of a long day out. A+ for location! Finally, Antoni made our stay better than we could have ever imagined. He is the sweetest man you'll ever meet and he has put a great deal of work and effort into his and Froso's beautiful back patio -- we loved learning about how we built everything and sat in admiration of the beautiful space he's created. He has a beautiful lemon tree, basil plants, and oregano and mint plants which we loved smelling each day. Antoni sat outside with us on the patio every night and told us many, many stories about Greece, about his life, and just about every other topic under the sun. Antoni kept us laughing and smiling all night long, and he gave us some of the best memories of our life. He has a wonderful spirit and a kind heart and we just absolutely loved spending time with him. Every night he cut us some delicious fresh watermelon, put on an old record for us all to listen to, and just made us so happy and made us feel so welcomed. We miss him and Nefelli the cat already so much! All in all, staying with Froso and Antoni far exceeded our expectations, as they are the kindest, warmest and most wonderful people. They made us feel like family. Take it this way -- we're..."
13874631,185599968,2017-08-22,1159228,Tania,"Froso & George are wonderful as is their place. They were both there to welcome us even though we arrived late, and are extremely kind, friendly and helpful.<br/><br/>The apartment is in a quiet residential neighborhood that makes you feel like you're a true resident of Athens. Even so, it is only a 10-15 minute walk to Athens' main tourist spots. The apartment is spacious and has a lot of character. We especially loved the patio area.<br/><br/>We would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone! "

The flat was very clean and organized. Froso and Antoni welcomed us with traditional Greek coffee and cookies. The location is just minute's walk to Plaka and the main site of Athens. They were also quick to offer recommendations on restaurants and places to explore.
13874631,195841168,2017-09-21,75947834,Katherine,Two of us stayed here for three nights. A great spot for a couple or could comfortably fit more people. They were very friendly.
13874631,196762575,2017-09-24,51662156,Matteo,"Great location and great host!very beautiful, big and clean flat i would recomend if you look for a spacious, practical, next to the center but in a quiet  street. The hosts are very kind and they make you feel at home"
13874631,198061342,2017-09-28,29083399,Kayan,"Froso""s apartment is nice and neat. We love it very much"
13874631,199600833,2017-10-02,13887456,Barbara,"Anyone coming to Athens would be lucky to meet Froso and her husband. They offer a lovely place in a quiet neighborhood. We like to walk, so didn't mind the 10 minutes it took us to get to the Acropolis area. They offer lively conversation, helpful tips, a friendly cat, relaxing terrace, and Greek coffee. Great space with everything you need after spending the days out and about Athens."
13874631,200634583,2017-10-06,58078065,Britt,"Froso was an excellent host and very quick at responding. The apartment is great, very clean and big. Location is within good walking distance to the city centre. Would highly recommend!"
13874631,201805103,2017-10-09,27073282,Serena,"We had such an amazing stay here! If you want to be right in the center of town but tucked away enough for total peace and quiet at night, book this house. Also look at that garden! It's even more beautiful in person, and such a lovely spot for breakfast or lunch at home.<br/><br/>Walking to the Acropolis takes about 10 minutes, and you're a 3-5 Euro Uber ride away from all the restaurants, bars and sights you'd want to visit. The location can't be beat.<br/><br/>And of course, another plus is the lovely couple who own the home and greet you with everything from coffee and cookies to stories behind the vintage items in the garden. Any questions you have, they'll be happy to answer!"
13874631,202862727,2017-10-13,3074737,Matt,Lovely quiet flat near everything but slightly removed from the busy tourist attractions. George and Froso were incredibly friendly and warm. They welcomed me and told me stories while we sat in the magical patio behind their house. Highly recommended.
13874631,203461941,2017-10-15,14128021,Michelle,"Wow...I could live in this apartment. Froso's place is much bigger in real life than it looks in photos. It's stylishly decorated, spacious and quiet, but the best part is the patio.  You will want to make sure you save time on your trip to relax out there and enjoy the tranquility with a morning coffee or a sunset glass of wine.<br/><br/>Froso was extremely responsive and was there to greet me when I arrived at the apartment. Both her and her husband are very friendly and welcoming. She showed me where the local restaurant was and provided some helpful tips for my stay.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is quiet. In addition to the local restaurant (great bean spread), there is a bakery, a couple of bars, coffee shop and grocery store within two blocks of the apartment. <br/><br/>The Plaka area is about a 10 minute walk away - so close enough to wander during the day before returning home to the peace and quiet of the apartment."

Froso's patio is what dreams are made of -- complete with a curious cat to greet you upon your arrival.  We were warmly greeted by Froso and her husband with greek coffee and great conversation, which was a wonderful way to start our stay.  The apartment is in an awesome location and super easy to walk to all the tourist sights, with a full kitchen, living room, and office if you're looking for a more long term stay."

The area was super quiet and we slept wonderfully. The WiFi was very good and speeds were good too. We were very sad to have to leave our hosts and our apartment. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. One tip I would give is be careful with the range as it seemed to get very hot even when set to a low temperature. Everything is with in walking distance and you never have to take a cab, unless you want to. We used the private transportation through our hosts from the airport and it was good and stress free. I highly recommend staying here!"

The apartment was incredibly clean- you could open the windows and enjoy the fresh breeze. The garden patio is magical-  a dream morning to enjoy your coffee and baked goods from the local bakery. The location could not be better. You can see the Parthenon from your doorstep and it's about a 10-15 minute walk from historic Plaka, the Olympic stadium, the Acropolis and the museum as well as the gardens. I would definitely stay here again!"

Our arrival time was delayed last minute and they were able to accommodate us for checking in late without any difficulty. They also added a little personal touch to the experience by having a notebook of previous guests to leave notes and tips from their own time in there. If we're ever back in Athens, we would come back to stay here in a heart beat!"

They greeted us with greek coffee, a tour of their wonderful  garden and helpful advise about the neighborhood. Their flat is centrally located (a 10 minute walk from the acropolis) but it is a quiet oasis from the crowds. The space is clean and tidy with everything you need while you stay in Athens. If you are planning some site seeing in the city, I would definitely recommend booking their flat. I hope they can host us again in the future."

The apartment was very spacious and clean and the bed was very comfortable (very important when travelling). Froso supplied lots of extras which is greatly appreciated, eg milk, butter, jams, bread, water and beer. We had trouble getting there as our taxi driver dropped us off at wrong address and tried to charge us an extra 10 euros, even though I showed him a map. The next taxi driver was fantastic so we used him again when we left. Froso and Anthony's courtyard was beautiful and was so nice sitting there drinking a cold beer when we arrived tired and exasperated after our taxi fiasco. We would definitely stay again if we visit Athens in the future.  The restaurant they recommended was great as it was good food at a reasonable price."

Easy walking distance to restaurants and cafes both on and off the beaten path. The apartment itself is extremely comfortable, and the outdoor space is truly amazing.

The hosts have a quite a green thumb and all the greenery makes the patio a lovely space to be in. While not directly in the busier areas near the Acropolis, this place offers wonderful hospitality and a small neighborhood feel. It's an easy walk to the Acropolis and the Acropolis Museum, in addition to two other major sites. There's a market, bakery, and a few local places to eat just a couple blocks away. <br/><br/>I really can't say enough about the host's wonderful hospitality. We really felt welcome.

Froso was quick to answer any questions and services that we needed from taxis, restaurant, directions. They also provide a guestbook with notes and tips for future stays!<br/>The location is quite convenient and walking distance to all of the attractions of the city.

13874631,416074915,2019-02-24,16944958,Iordan,"We had a great stay at Froso's place! I stayed there with my girlfriend for three nights, and everything was just as we expected (or better!). The apartment was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Communication with Froso was clear and efficient. The place is on a small street in a residential neighborhood, so it was very quiet, especially at night. It was close to the major tourist destinations, but away from all the bustle and touristy shops. The nearest metro stop (Akropoli) was about 10 minutes away by foot, and the more central stop Syntagma was about 15-20 minutes away. I think there is also a bus stop close by, but we always just walked to the metro. There were some convenient shops and restaurants nearby. Overall highly recommend!"

On top of being super close to all the major attractions, the home is really beautiful and the family is so, so kind and helpful (and they have a super cute cat!).They gave us great recommendations for restaurants to try and things to check out that were more off the beaten path than the usual tourist places.  The garden is lovely, the entire place was spotless, and there wasn't anything more we could have asked for.  I highly recommend staying here when you get the chance!"

Froso was able to give us restaurant tips, homemade Greek coffee, and was kind enough to mail a wristwatch that I had forgotten, while we were still in Greece but before we left back for the US! Our only regret was not staying in Athens longer, but I highly recommend this AirBnB if you want something walkable to the Athens city center, with plenty of local charm!"
13874631,436948251,2019-04-14,139426524,Aileen,"Froso and George is definitely most considerate and sweet host !<br/>Their house is cozy and beautiful, location is nearby to all touristy places, about 10mins by foot. <br/>The burger that George recommend (Golibri) is awesome, must try their burger, pizza and pull pork.<br/>I would recommend take taxi from the airport straight away to their house, road in Athens is rocky and steep.<br/>I would say the stays with Froso is perfectly Good!<br/><br/>房子和照片一样漂亮,屋主很好,给了很多建议,地点也不错,去各个观光景点都很靠近,走路差不多10多分钟. 房子很舒服很温馨,非常喜欢❤️"
13874631,439494954,2019-04-19,113781165,Eldon,Thanks Froso and his wife for hosting in Athens.<br/><br/>We stayed in Froso's house for three nights. It is really a nice experience for our first stay in Athens. The house is big and within the walking distance to major sightseeing spots. The house is also very clean and comfortable.<br/><br/>The host also gave us good advice and help in our trip. The restaurant they recommended is good also.
13874631,441779615,2019-04-22,51020001,Murrill,"The perfect place to stay in Athens! We arrived a from a long journey and were greeted with amazing hospitality from the whole family.  They provided a warm welcome and a wealth of local knowledge. From amenities to location, this place is an absolute gem!"
13874631,443527914,2019-04-26,49357242,雨晴,"Very comfortable and convenient. Quite at night, and near to the landmarks like Olympieion and Panathenean Stadium."
13874631,445896451,2019-04-30,74243466,Nicole,"Froso and his families are all wonderful Greek locals. We enjoy their hospitality so much, much beyond our expectation. We arrive on the Orthodox holiday, so many places like museums are closed. Froso was very kind to invite us to his family feast, which was held in their lovely courtyard. It was truly the authentic Greek festival that we experienced. We also enjoy talking with his son Georgios who was a smart and friendly guy. He showed us the roof where we could see Acropolis without view barrier. I recommend their place to anyone visiting Athens."
13874631,452486235,2019-05-13,13211359,Catherine,"Nice people, at a great location."
13874631,456650795,2019-05-22,248485336,Thijs,"Great place, very clean! Lovely garden and very nice people which gave us some great recommendations about places to visit etc.<br/>Location is fine: we were able to access all sight seeings by foot (10 up to 20 minutes walking distance, depending on what you want to visit) ."
13874631,459226790,2019-05-27,160229931,Lauren,"We really enjoyed our stay here! Froso was very accommodating and helpful, the space was clean, and the location can’t be beat."
13874631,461194306,2019-05-31,198015114,Kyae,"To me, Athens was magical, and Froso's flat was definitely a part of it. Many thanks for your kind thoughts!"
13874631,463877670,2019-06-04,13577992,Carissa,"If you find yourself in Athens, then be sure to stay here! The rental flat is simply amazing—it’s large with so many great amenities and it’s easy to feel like you are at home. Froso and her husband are exceptionally kind and gracious hosts who give you privacy but are also friendly and quick to respond. The neighborhood is great, too. Ten minute walk to the Acropolis and the hustle and bustle of Athens, but far enough away to be quiet and restorative. There are bars, coffee shops, and restaurants nearby. <br/><br/>One thing I really appreciated was Froso’s help in coordinating transport to and from the airport. Their driver is reliable, friendly and kind. <br/><br/>Book here!"
13874631,467135584,2019-06-10,112574,Dianna,We had a wonderful time.  Great host that went above and beyond for us.   My husband and I would highly recommend this lovely apartment in the heart of Athens.

13874631,472617029,2019-06-20,97599638,Michael,Great place. Excellent location. Beautiful apartment with lovely courtyard. Close to everything you want to see in Athens.
13874631,477294031,2019-06-28,92592286,Donna,Do take up the taxi offer to pick you up from airport. Made travelling alone so safe. I was made to feel very welcomed. Frosco offered the use of their family courtyard. Loved the apartment!
13874631,481562302,2019-07-05,97599638,Michael,"Fantastic apartment close to all the sights in Athens. Warm, accommodating hosts. The apartment is large, clean, cool and relaxing. Perfect for a stay in Athens. We hope to stay with Froso again!"
13874631,485179028,2019-07-10,167267489,Michael,"Great couple, wonderful help. <br/>Maybe air con in main area , would help. Otherwise great stay"

13874631,494385359,2019-07-24,235340707,Noelle,"We had an incredible time at Froso’s Place! We couldn’t be happier with the location- walking distance from everything. What really made our 3 day stay so special was how Froso and George went above and beyond to help us- travel questions, taxis, ticket printing, and so much more. The space was also was so big and spacious. We loved our time there so much!"
13874631,500986836,2019-08-03,14567553,Jennifer,"Froso’s home is very comfortable, and the house has high ceilings and beautiful bones. The garden is lovely and there’s a little room off the garden with old records and photos from travels to the states long ago. The house is in an old neighborhood with narrow streets and is in easy walking distance to the stadium, Zeus’ temple, the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum, and the Plaka with shopping and restaurants. 20 minute walk to the ancient Agora. I couldn’t have hoped for a better location that was also quiet and off the beaten path. There are also a handful of small non-touristy restaurants and tavernas just down the hill. Wonderful place!"
13874631,503611212,2019-08-06,1162142,Kathryn,"Froso and his wife are warm and welcoming hosts. The flat is spacious, clean, quiet, and in a convenient location. The only issue is that AC is only in the bedroom. If you strongly need AC, keep that in mind."
13874631,505303611,2019-08-09,32626500,Alexandria,They were wonderful and the place was extremely cute. The little garden out back was adorable. The location was perfect just a few minute walk to the acropolis and main areas.
13874631,509909240,2019-08-15,14823011,Mantas,"Great place. Everything was there for a nice homestay.  Lovely yard and hosts which were there at a hamds reach. The neighbourghhood is quiet and nice, everything is within walking distance."

We spent a whole afternoon there for the sunshine and drinking cold beers in their garden, it was so relaxing!<br/>And Froso was being so helpful, she was giving us great help about everything!<br/>The location is lovely, there are bars cafes restaurants nearby, like 3 mins walk. And you can walk to the main commercial area as well.<br/>If we are coming back in Athens in the future, we will choose to stay here again!"
13874631,534894151,2019-09-23,768945,Andy,"We felt like staying at relatives’ home,  cosy and retro house, lovely neighborhood, close to everything. This is what Airbnb experience should be like!"

13874631,540883284,2019-10-04,90364654,Blandine,An outstanding hospitality is what you will experience when staying with Froso and Tony. As soon as I arrived I was given the warmest welcome and attention I experience with an airbnb host; they made me feel as a long time friend visiting them.The apartment is very clean comfortable. Mets is a quiet area giving you a true Greek lifestyle with local cafes and restaurants. Acropolis is an easy 20mn walking distance. I loved my stay at Froso's and recommend to anyone who wishes to experience a warm Greek hospitality.
13874631,543652000,2019-10-08,59808310,Jonquil,Super cute place with lots of room inside and out. Froso was very sweet and helpful. Highly recommended!

13876561,98466094,2016-08-31,91255197,Panagiota,"The loft is incredible, just as it is shown in the pictures, clean, modern with everything you need inside. The balcony is perfect to relax after a long day, furnished with relaxing sofa and table and Acropolis view. Although I know Athens, I didn t know the area of Pagkrati and Mets very well. Konstantina took us on a tour of the neighbourhood and pointed out some of her favourite restaurants and bars. Her recommendations were great and during our stay she answered any questions we had. The location is beautiful, walking distance to metro points, peaceful, surrounded with shops bars and restaurants.
<br/>Both the loft and Konstantina are terrific! We highly recommend her apartment!"

13876561,427960920556040947,2021-08-13,361092123,Greg,I can't recommend this place enough. The host is absolutely incredible and offers first class service. Definitely above and beyond! I love the views of the Acropolis and the sea. Wonderful outdoor space and a great shower. Varnava Square and the whole neighborhood is really amazing and exactly the kind of Athenian place I was looking for.
13876561,458473621508161736,2021-09-24,4338788,Julia,"The apartment is incredibly well designed with lots of storage and appliances in a small space. Chryssa is a wonderful host, who made us feel welcome and looked after. We will be back!"

It will work great for (Hidden by Airbnb) , (Hidden by Airbnb) , etc but more than that it is very slow. Beautiful apartment, great neighborhood and unbeatable terrace and view."
13877247,704975692,2020-10-30,102716126,Panos,Beautiful and clean apartment with an amazing spacious balcony and view.<br/>Would definitely rebook. <br/><br/>Internet was very slow but processes had already started (as of Oct 2020) for the whole building to get upgraded with high speed internet. <br/><br/>There's also a ~40inch TV facing the bed which is really convenient. I believe it is not shown in the pictures of the listing and it's also not a smart TV. Ideally bring a firestick or chromecast etc if you're into that thing.<br/><br/>I stayed and worked from this apartment  for more than a month and I am very satisfied.<br/><br/>Thank you Chryssa!
13877247,735047511,2021-02-28,29860432,Fatime,Nice flat in central location with a beautiful view over the city from the big terrace.<br/>Supermarkets and shops in close walking distance.<br/>It's fully equipped and provides all you need for a comfortible stay =)

Good for two people with sufficient space to work and move around the apartment. Great views as well! <br/><br/>There were just some minor issues that were not highlighted. The water from the shower area tends to leak out into the main toilet area so it made the toilet wet sometimes. There were two stoves but the bigger one always stopped working halfway while we were cooking. Items such as oil and a kitchen knife were not provided so be prepared to purchase your own if you wish to cook in the apartment, which we did quite a bit. <br/><br/>There is a cleaning lady who comes in once a week to do cleaning which is extremely nice especially for our long stay."

<br/>The location of the property is great if you want to be in the middle of the Gazi night life district. not ideal for families though."

He also even took it further by making sure we knew and understood that he would be there for us if we needed help with anything.The room was very clean and efficient and definitely close to any and all things that we could meet in the surrounding area. I'm done. The room was very clean and efficient and definitely close to any and all things that we could meet in the surrounding area. I'm done.

13890217,100241287,2016-09-08,2672198,Gunnar,Sleepness nights in Athens. The flat is next to 4-lane central road. The host kindly offered one of his other apartments. But that one was next to a night flea market.
13890217,103378290,2016-09-22,60062344,James,"Kostas' place was very nice. I was welcomed upon arrival, given a fruit basket, maps of the city, breakfast recommendations, and helpful tips. The apartment is very nice and new. Everything is in great order. The Athens Acropolis can be seen only from the patio and jacuzzi on the roof which is a great place to sit. "
13890217,106807957,2016-10-08,33459457,Michel P,"Das Haus liegt nicht unbedingt mehr im Trendviertel Gazi. Dafür direkt bei der Metrostation. Begrüssung war nett und freundlich! Yanis (Vertrauter von Kostas) nahm sich sehr viel Zeit um mir die Fahrten an die entsprechenden Orte zu erklären! Auch im Luxus Apartment wurde alles super erklärt! 
<br/>Das Apartment ist genau mein Style, frisch, trendig und modern. Tolle kleine Küche, super Badezimmer! "
13890217,110692438,2016-10-28,57364404,Lars,Very nice apartment on a good location. We were able to reach all the highligts by foot within a reasonable distance. The hosts are great and always available if you need something. <br/>

Small kitchen with basic amenities but we were out anyway alot. Technopolis is 5 min walk from the apartment and has lots of trendy good restaurants. We would stay here again.

13890217,188941289,2017-08-31,5189369,Peer,"Fantastisch! Einfach ein Traum. Kostas ist ein wirklich großartiger und fürsorglicher Host, der auf jeden Wunsch eingeht. Die Lage ist grandios und natürlich der Blick vom Dach, aus dem Jacouzzi auf die Acropolis ein Traum. Einzig zu beachten ist das es sich um mehrere Apartments mit gemeinsam benutzen Dach handelt. Aber die Apartmenst sind alle ähnlich der Bilder ausgestattet und natürlich LUXORY ;)"
13890217,194156119,2017-09-16,56194951,Lauren,"My two friends and I had one day / night in Athens after traveling through Greece for the week. We found Kostas's place exactly suited to our needs - the double bed and additional two single beds were perfect for our group of 3 (we would just recommend the addition of more blankets for the single beds, as we got cold!). We really appreciated the timely communication from our host(s), since we had an early arrival on Friday and staggered check outs on Saturday; with our host's help, we were still able to drop our bags and everything. There was plenty of space in the apartment for us, and it was fairly modern / convenient. The rooftop was also lovely for a sunset / view of the Acropolis. My only other commentary for consideration before booking would be: - it's easily accessible by metro if you're comfortable figuring it out, or by walking if you don't mind a little trek to get into the midst of things - the hot water was a little hard to manage - it's more of a hotel / suite of apartments than someone's home (depending on what you're looking for, this might be a pro or a con) - it's near a somewhat busy road / train track, so you might hear a bit of noise (might be an issue if you're a light sleeper). All in all, however, it was a good stay and I wouldn't mind staying again in the future."
13890217,212530949,2017-11-18,38751839,Kyle,"Kostas was so hospitable and the apartment is beautiful. Enjoy luxurious accommodations inside, then treat yourself to an eyeful of the Acropolis on the rooftop. Definitely recommend!"

Yes the host told me i can checkout and get a refund but i have already moved in. There were no extra pillows available, no extra blankets, only one toilet paper was available, and im not supposed to be calling asking for extra toilet paper. I also saw a couple of cockroaches (the flying ones). The apartment wasn’t cleaned properly in general. There was a note saying there is complimentary drinks but sadly the cups were empty.

We were expecting something different. <br/>Hot water for the shower only did last for 1/2 a shower.<br/>The water in the jacuzzi had a very bad smell, it seemed to be old and dirty.<br/>There were no given address which made the check in process quiet hard. I would not book this place again."

However if you do not want to walk, there is a metro station close to the appartement (Keramikos), three minutes on foot. You can reach Keramikos easily from the airport. In the direction of the airport, the following station is Monastiraki, the centre of Athens. The station after Monastiraki is Syntagma. <br/>In addition, the team is very helpful, special thanks to Valentino and Alex. <br/>Best regards,<br/>Jalel"

The apartment is very modern (renovated on very high standards) with great ammenities and the most fantastic view in Athens! My husband and myself are both from Athens and we know that a view like this is hard to find. The location is very central and convenient. Olympia is a great host, very discreet and extremely helpful.  Surely, we will be staying in this apartment many times in the future. Thank you Olympia!

The view was phenomenal. Olympia was more than helpful with answering our questions and made suggestions as well for our trip in Athens. A wonderful hostess that helped us until the end of our stay! 
13906219,106427817,2016-10-06,13673917,Patric,"I have been for business purposes sevetal times in Athens this year and tried several Airbnbs. But this apartment is honestly the best I have found in Athens for the size of 1-4 people. It's beautifully designed, modern and new, has two bedrooms and bathrooms and a big terrace with an amazing view on cental Athens and Acropolis. <br/>Olympia is very kind, helpful, and available if you need her. Thank you again and see you again soon!"

Beautiful view from the 6th floor and close to everything. She is a great communicator, so do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions! Visit Acropolis, take a hop on and hop off bus, take a ferry to Hydra Island and check out some restaurants and bars. Loved Greece and will be back!"
13906219,116735974,2016-12-03,25458915,Hans,"A memorable stay in an fantastic apartment and location in Athens ! Olympia was a really nice host, uncomplicated and highly responsive. Her apartment exceeded our already high expectations and we felt immediately at home. Everything was extremely clean and gave the impression as if we were the first and only guests staying at Olympia's home. We felt save and cared about and highly enjoyed our stay (to say nothing about the view) ! Hope Olympia's location will be available when we come to Athens next time ..."
13906219,124514756,2017-01-02,8270143,Ariola,Olympia's place was simply perfect. We went to Athens during the holiday season both Christmas and New Year! Olympia's place was decorated which was a pleasant surprise. The apartment is exactly as in the photos. Two bathrooms which was so convenient as we were three adults staying over. The beds were very comfortable and we had a great sleep. <br/>Olympia was very kind as she had prepared for us small things for breakfast and some Greek deserts for the Christmas period. <br/>Location wise the place is amazing. Not so central to avoid the night noises but central enough to be in 10-15 on foot at Syntagme square. The best part was the metro station which was literally 2 min from the apartment and just 2 stops from the center. <br/>Also the area is full of nice restaurant. Especially the Kolonaki area which is few minutes away on foot. <br/>Highly recommend the place for a group of friends or family.
13906219,134589721,2017-02-28,111389426,Annette,"Olympia's home is just as wonderful as both previous guests and photos suggest. In fact it is better to be honest . The location is central enough to be within 20 minutes walk of the Acropolis or for those who don't wish to walk the underground station is just 2 minutes away . <br/><br/>The views are amazing and we have enjoyed a coffee on the balcony just watching the world go by. The apartment has everything you could possibly need and was immaculate.<br/><br/>So many wonderful places to visit in this very magical city. For something different I would recommend visiting Plaka where there are some beautiful taverna's and coffee shops all located on steps. For something a little special head to Monastiraki and 'A for Athens' a roof top bar and restaurant . <br/><br/>Olympia has been the perfect host . Nothing has been too much trouble . So easy to get in touch with and we were lucky enough to meet her when we arrived . She has been very thoughtful leaving some essentials to get us started like water and coffee , juice and biscuits and a wonderful selection for breakfast and even chocolates .<br/><br/>I will be booking up again it really was an incredible find .  <br/><br/>Thank you Olympia see you again soon ."

13906219,152591577,2017-05-17,124662594,Ramesh,"Firstly, I would agree with other reviews that this flat is wonderful. It is well furnished and decorated. It has very high quality appliances it is quite and in secure location. Nearby there are a few supermarkets and nice places to eat. The metro is just across the road. If you like walking then Syntagma and Monastriaki areas are 15/20 minutes walk. The view from the balcony of Acropolis etc are wonderful. <br/>Our host Olympia she has been very helpful. The day we arrived the taxi driver wasn’t clear about the location of the place, we called Olympia and she was able to give him the right directions. When we entered the flat, it looks just as good as the photos, and there was complimentary milk, biscuits, coffee, chocolates etc waiting for us. Whenever we rang or text her she managed to answer our queries. On the day before our departure we learned that the Greek Air Traffic Controllers were going on strike and our flight were cancelled. We called Olympia and asked her if we could stay in the flat a bit longer till we find alternate flight. She was very understanding and allowed us to stay on. We managed to find the flight and the TAXIBEAT app for Taxi,  she recommended came in very useful on the strike day.<br/>We would definitely be returning to this place and would highly recommend this flat to my friend and family.<br/>"

The apartment exactly matched all of the photos on Airbnb, and was very spacious with upscale decor and amenities.  The apartment is conveniently located close to the Metro station (two blocks through a couple of parks) and many shops and restaurants are within walking distance.  We loved the bakery around the corner and their impressive and inexpensive deserts.  Olympia was easy to work with and arrange exchange of the keys for the apartment.  We had no issues over our week stay and we definitely stay there again if we return to Athens."

Vicino c’è anche un supermercato,ben fornito di tutto.<br/>Letti e divano sono molto comodi <br/>Non ultima la bella terrazza con una splendida vista , larga da poterci stare comodamente in quattro. La casa è al sesto piano ( con ascensore ) e la vista la sera sulla città e l’Acropoli tutta illuminata è magnifica.<br/>La posizione è comoda da ogni punto di vista : a piedi con una passeggiata tranquilla si arriva a piazza Syntagma, passando dal giardino nazionale o dal bel stadio olimpico e dal tempio di Zeus <br/>A due passi la fermata della metropolitana che collega sia il centro che l’aeroporto <br/>L’affaccio è su un giardino, la strada dietro invece è vivace e ricca di negozi e bei locali .<br/>Olimpia è bravissima disponibile sempre, risponde subito ai messaggi ed è stata di grande aiuto in tutto dandoci ottimi consigli ."

The red hop on hop off  sight seeing bus stopped across the street.Nicely equipped Apartment with everything that we needed to make our stay both comfortable and enjoyable. Nice comfortable beds.

13906219,275927368,2018-06-12,16468268,Abenaa,"The apartment is very clean and modern. The two bathrooms were a big bonus. The front balcony is bigger than it appear in the pictures and is a nice place to catch the sun at the end of the day. It is a bit noisy on the balcony because of the nearby road, but very quiet inside the apartment. There is also a small balcony off the main bedroom.<br/><br/>The location is excellent. 5 min walk to metro station, 20 min walk to main attractions, taxis cost 3 or 4 euros to Plaka etc.  There are shops, cafes etc very close to the apartment.<br/><br/>We didn't meet Olympia, but she was an excellent communicator, always available, and accommodating of a last minute change of plans.

The apartment itself is spotless and the view from the balcony was amazing. We arrived at Athens late at night and Olympia had no problem accommodating our schedule. Communication was practically instantaneous and everything in the apartment was clearly labeled with nice touches everywhere (example: water and orange juice in the fridge, welcome chocolates, etc) The wifi was strong (according to the kids who are addicted to netflix) and supplies like towels, shampoo, toilet paper are available in abundance.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a place to stay in Athens then look no further. I would highly recommend Oylmpia's apartment and I would definitely stay here again."
13906219,295193280,2018-07-23,145204574,Anke,"Wir waren mit drei Personen in Olympias Apartment - und hätten bequem auch mit vier Personen Platz, denn ohne die Nutzung der Couch im geräumigen Wohnzimmer können vier Erwachsene problemlos in 2 Doppelbetten (2 Matratzen) schlafen, und es gibt zwei Bäder!<br/>Das Apartment war blitzsauber und es fehlte einfach an nichts: weder im Bad, noch in der Küche. Für unser erstes Frühstück alles vorhanden, was phantastisch war, da wir sehr spät nachts angereist sind. Check-In und Check-Out waren absolut problemlos, obwohl wir Olympia selbst leider gar nicht gesehen haben (Check-Out war auch mitten in der Nacht).<br/>Da wir das erste Mal in Athen waren, hatte ich allerlei Fragen, die Olympia stets direkt sehr freundlich beantwortet hat - es war einfach alles großartig.<br/>Beim nächsten Mal in Athen würde ich mit mehreren Personen wieder dieses - auch mit Klimaanlagen versehene (nicht unwichtig im Hochsommer!) - Apartment buchen. Es ist absolut den Preis wert.<br/>Einziger kleiner Nachteil: Den Verkehr auf der nahegelegenen Hauptverkehrsstraße hört man lautstark auf dem großen Balkon; bei geschlossener Balkontür ist es drinnen allerdings leise."

My teenage daughter and I had more than enough space to have time away from one another, it was wonderful having two full bathrooms. One to explore, I felt extremely safe in the neighbourhood. Within walking distance of most major tourist attractions, and only a stones throw from the Metro station was a massive bonus! Olympia is an attentive host, fast communication and she left us some lovely touches upon our arrival.i have already recommended this apartment to friends and family and won’t hesitate to return in the future!"

13906219,562606842,2019-11-11,71583842,Lampros,"Outstanding apartment, host and location. Will be our go-to place when we need one in Athens."
13906219,656844330,2020-08-27,6951319,Jennifer & Dave,"Perfect location, beautiful flat. Great wifi for remote working. Would definately stay again!"
13906219,742074265,2021-03-25,1963475,Jon,"Olympia's place was simply phenomenal. So much so, an initial month's stay turned into a little over 5 months! <br/><br/>The location is perfect as it's in one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Athens, a quick walk to Kolonaki, the National Gardens and a slightly longer stroll (~20min) to the Acropolis and other historical sites. The metro is also just across the street for longer treks and transit to the airport. <br/><br/>The apartment is pristine and nicely decorated with an amazing balcony that has a clear view of Mt. Lycabettus and the Acropolis in the distance. <br/><br/>Olympia is also a wonderful person, super accommodating and very quick to respond - we had asked for an extra fan which she brought over promptly and was super flexible when we kept extending our stay.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this place enough - you'll be happy you stayed here!"
13906219,758231577,2021-05-15,58574385,Thomas,"Haben über 5 Wochen in diesem wundervollen Appartment verbracht. Haben in Athen (im Homeoffice) arbeiten können und die Zeit unfassbar genossen. <br/>Das Apartment ist sehr sauber, sehr gut gelegen, der checkin war einfach und unkompliziert und von Olympia haben wir zu jederzeit gute Tipps bekommen. <br/><br/>Viele Restaurants in walking distance. Kolonaki direkt vor der Tür. Ruhige Neighbourhood, gut bürgerlich würde man wohl sagen. Supermarkt in 500 m.<br/><br/>Haben viele Tipps, wer Interesse hat kann sich gerne melden (Restaurants, Scooter Verleih, nahe Umgebung usw.)<br/><br/>Bin ziemlich sicher, dass wir das wieder machen :)"
13906219,768032126,2021-06-08,239586525,Nik,Very nice Appartement. Clean and comfy near the centre. Metro nearby. <br/>Everything was just fine. Thank you for a nice stay.
13906219,388141928421262223,2021-06-19,3893038,Kristine,"Very clean, well furnished. Our flight arrived earlier than planned and she was able to accommodate us quickly. Walking distance to Kolonaki. The main boulevard can sometimes be a bit loud, but you don't hear it from the bedroom. My partner and I were both working remotely with video calls all day and the sound wasn't much of a bother. The internet was also fast. Overall, great host, great apartment."
13906219,390975218942662639,2021-06-23,81436902,Dimitri,"Great location, good view, excellent communication. The rooms are on the small size but very convenient for 2 people or a couple with a kid."
13906219,406265125073800652,2021-07-14,16996723,Seth,"Pros: Great location, super clean apartment, and walking distance to the Syntagma. The host was also super responsive and quick to message back.<br/><br/>Cons: For the price we paid we feel that we did not get enough value. The internet was not usable; 2mbps download speed and 0.95 upload. One of the showers did not get hot water and both toilets had issues with flushing. The sliding door to the balcony was also damaged and the smart TV was locked not allowing you to watch Netflix.<br/><br/>Overall, the value was not there for us. It's a great property but not for the price."
13906219,418611856165682735,2021-07-31,383942455,Bridget,"Overall good apartment, central and close walk to shops, restaurants and Kolonaki"
13906219,424386013179813570,2021-08-08,63471933,Jaya,"Wonderful apartment in a very convenient location. The space is light, well designed and stocked (equipment etc) with everything we needed for our one-week stay. <br/>Personally, I loved Olympia’s style and sense of aesthetics in the apartment in the small touches  - we really enjoyed our stay and will be looking to book again when we are back in Athens.<br/>And I must mention the view from the terrace - what a great space to sit out and have your cup of coffee or glass of wine! Even in the heat, the terrace provided a really nice way for us to get some fresh air in the evenings."
13912611,85595480,2016-07-12,5984378,Nastiti,"Great place, spacious, clean and central. Lilly was a great host, welcomed us nicely and gave us many tips to enjoy Athens. Same day check-in. Overall a good experience. Recommended for a young couple."

D’ailleurs, Lilly et Yanis sont très gentils, ils nous ont répondu très rapidement. La chambre est propre, y a aussi un terrase. je y pense à nouveau la prochaine fois quand je vais à Athen."
13912611,86344866,2016-07-16,643006,Jessica,"Lilly was an absolutely wonderful host, warm and inviting. She gave us clear instructions on how to arrive to the B&B and even waited for us on her front steps! She was invaluable in helping us plan our day in Athens, telling us where to go and eat. The apartment itself is a beautiful, magical historic building in the center of town. Would recommend to other travelers looking for a unique place to stay. "
13912611,87213031,2016-07-19,17292645,Carlos,"Lilly fue muy agradable con nosotros y estuvo muy atenta en cuanto a la hora de nuestra llegada y demás. Sin embargo, la habitación era muy muy ruidosa, además de que el techo estaba comunicado con una buhardilla en la que estuvieron haciendo ruido hasta altas horas de la madrugada. No pudimos dormir en toda la noche y no sentimos privacidad alguna. No recomendaría este alojamiento por el precio al que se me ofreció."
13912611,87255782,2016-07-19,49146805,Olivia,"Lilly was the most lovely host, she gave us the grand tour of the amazing house. She even provided us with a food/drink guide around athens and the places were all perfect! "

<br/>A very great place!!  beautiful house with full of charm and extra clean! Lilly and her flatmate are adorable. They are nice and  helpfull. The location is ideal ! I strongly recommend Lilly's place :)"
13912611,89533366,2016-07-29,30897339,Roxanne,Lilly is a lovely and very personable host. I arrived late and she graciously waited for me. The house has a lot of charm and character. I would definitely recommend this place!

13912611,91649528,2016-08-06,22094434,Margaux,"The hosts were there to welcome us when we arrive. It was very easy to find the apartment thanks to the info Lilly gave us before hand ! The location is perfect, close to everything by feet and still in a quiet street ! The blue room was spacious and comfy (we suffered from the heat despite the fan which was quite noisy but everything else was perfect). We would definitely stay there again if we go back to Athens ! "
13912611,91767201,2016-08-06,79147659,Melissa,"Lily is lovely, she was flexible when I arrived early and was incredibly helpful in navigating the city. The room is comfortable, the little balcony is beautiful. The home itself is very old and has some definite quirks, but it's an incredible value for the location!"
13912611,92132178,2016-08-07,30933659,Juan,"Lilly was very flexible regarding the check-in and check-out time. The place has a very good location. 
<br/>"
13912611,92534506,2016-08-09,18461706,Ana,"It was hard to get understood about arriving and drop of luggage since we arrived in the middle of the night at the airport, there was confusion untill the day before arrival, was a bit stressy because of that. I wander if the english language was the cause of that. Once it was cleared out, we were friendly welcomed by Gianni, a housemate. The room was clean and lookes as on the airbnbsite. There was some cityinformation, all effeciently done. We did not meet Lilly, no idea why. Good place, nice old building, price/quality very good. Also that it is really close to the old places is a great +"
13912611,93486362,2016-08-13,81520048,Karima,"We spent three days there and we absolute enjoyed it! The house is located in Athen's centre so you can get everywhere by short walks, for example the main atraction, Acropolis. Lilly offered us a plan including special tipps of restaurants and places to visit. In the evening we sat on our balcony. Thank you and Giannis for that nie and comfortable stay! "
13912611,93878239,2016-08-14,5807463,Sid,"What a house! In a fabulous location in the middle of Athens, but just far away enough from Syntagma Square to not be hectic with traffic. You will get the hubbub of people down below, but I like that -- I'm a city boy.<br/><br/>Giannis was my host while Lilly was away, and he was one of the most welcoming hosts I've ever had on Airbnb.<br/><br/>The room and bed were very comfortable."
13912611,94994946,2016-08-17,82793510,Alexis,"Nous avons été accueillis par Giannis, habitant du même appartement. Très sympathique. Logement très bien situé. Le soir plein de possibilités pour manger, pour sortir. Super "
13912611,96538463,2016-08-23,84062023,Markus,"Even though we didn't meet Lilly in person, we had a fantastic stay at her place! Her flat mates are super nice, we hanged out a lot and talked about almost everything. And the rooms are even nicer than the photos suggest (Giannis can tell you a lot more about them!). Whenever we come back to Athens, we'll stay at their place again! "
13912611,98022988,2016-08-29,31783460,Joaquim,"Lilly wasn't there the night we spent in the house but she was very nice and friendly when we communicate by message.
<br/>
<br/>Regarding the house, it is just amazing and beautiful. Not only the apartment itself but also the decoration and the atmosphere.
<br/>
<br/>Gianni, who wlecomed us was very very nice and friendly. He gave us all information we needed and offered his assistance if we needed anything else.
<br/>
<br/>As described, the neighbourhood is very noisy but it is important to mention that it is also noisy from inside as the windows are old and won't prevent noise from outside. There is no proper ceiling in the rooms so you can literally haer everything from the other rooms. As other guests might be staying in the house at the same time as you, if you are not lucky it could be hard to handle the fact that they might be singing at 2 am! If you are even less lucky, a dog will be barking nearby outside roughly from 3am to 5am or 6 am!
<br/>
<br/>Once you get to sleep, make sure you get something to cover your eyes if you are sensitive to light as there is no blinds but only light white curtains, so the room will get very bright very early in the morning.
<br/>
<br/>Again, the people like the hosue are lovely but it is really important to understand that it will be very noisy (outside and inside) and very bright  in the morning."

13912611,98499172,2016-08-31,3790019,Virginie,"We stayed only one night but everything was perfect, from the indication, to our arrival. We have not met with Lilly but with Giannis, Lilly's roommate who has been very kind and helpful. The room was super clean, you have a private balcony, with shared bathroom and toilets. We have really enjoyed the neighborhood, close to all majors touristic places but also a very popular area where you can find lovely bars and restaurants that are less touristic. Lilly had prepared some helpful tips with her favorites places that we have tried with pleasure!The only negative point is that the street is a bit noisy, but with ears plugs you will be fine! Very good value for money. I will for sure recommend the place!"

13912611,101561623,2016-09-14,50730509,Wojciech,A fantastic place to stay. Lilly is extremely lovely and friendly. She kindly let me in at 1:30am as I had a late flight into Athens and immediately made me feel at home. The room is spacious and clean and has a balcony. The location is very good too;  around 5 minute walk from Syntagma. I would definitely recommend it to travellers just be weary of the cat if you have allergies.
13912611,101633239,2016-09-14,19242520,Molly,"The 1860's historic mansion is a gem! 
<br/>
<br/>Very reasonably priced for the location and the delightful hospitality from Lilly, Giannis, and Mimis.  I enjoyed cute coffee, ice cream, and gift shops and amazing bars and restaurants all in short walking distance.  It's close to Syntagma and Monastiraki Squares, Plaka, and the Acopolis.  And it has the perfect balcony to sit, read, enjoy the sunshine, pretend to be a local, and watch Athens stroll by!  The blue room, bathroom, and kitchen are clean and happy.  Lily mentions that that place is noisy, you are absolutely in the middle of town and should know that if you're a light sleeper, but it didn't bother me at all.  
<br/>
<br/>Lilly, Giannis, and Mimis are the best part about this place.  Amazing people with big hearts!  They provided great directions, contacted me prior to and during my visit to make sure I had everything I needed, they welcomed me with open arms and hearts.  Lilly left me a welcome packet with recommendations for local eats, drinks, places to visit, with maps to find my way around.  At one of the places she suggested, someone asked me how I heard about it, and requested I not give away one of Athens' best kept secrets. :)

<br/>The best Airbnb experience so far!"
13912611,112974496,2016-11-09,14730279,Ryo,"One of the best Airbnb experiences we have had (and we have been fortunate with quite a few..)!  Lilly Giannis and Mimis are all friendly and welcoming hosts, and Betty the cat is a little shy but cute and adorable once you show her that you are all friends.  The Blue room we stayed in was beautifully decorated with a private balcony which was perfect for a relaxing glass of wine, and the house is perfectly situated to explore Athens whether it be as a tourist or on business.  Lilly had compiled some recommendations for restaurants etc which were great help, and she was really flexible with our late check-in as well as keeping our luggage on our last day.  The only point to note is that there is a bit of noise from the streets at night so if you are a light sleeper you may want to bring some ear plugs. Otherwise, a wonderful combination of people, location, room and cat!"

Wir sind sehr herzlich empfangen worden und es wurde sich liebevoll darum bemüht uns eine schöne und angenehme Zeit innerhalb der 3er-Wg zu bereiten. Auch eine Einladung zum weihnachtlichen Truthahnessen war dabei... Für alle, die nicht 100% Ruhe benötigen, empfehlen wir dieses Unterkunft herzlich weiter. Kathrin und Maria"
13912611,123228530,2016-12-28,65516840,Tenzin,Lily is an awesome host and very kind and welcoming. The place is very close to the center square and at a convenient location. She had great recommendations and I would stay here again.<br/><br/>Thank you Lily.
13912611,124560804,2017-01-02,5841401,Andrea,"The best esperience I have ever had in my life with Airbnb. I am a traveler, I have been in Athens ten times but I had never had such a welcoming, openminded, free and shared stay. Lilly, Giannis and Mimis really are sharing not just their beautiful, cozy house in the main center of Athens (surrounded by so many nice bars and resto) but also their lives. Everyone is more than pleased to talk, to help you, to make you live like you were born in Athens. I suggest this place to everyone who likes true travels, true experiences, people with a big heart. "

13912611,126890739,2017-01-15,26284159,Pedro,"It was my best experience on Airbnb as a guest. I stayed in the wonderful Blue Room very comfortable, nicely decorated and with an amazing balcony. The setting is perfect for relaxing. Lilly Giannis and Mimis are all friendly and welcoming hosts. Sympathy, communication, accessibility were the key notes. They left me a welcome packet with recommendations for local eats, drinks, places to visit, with maps to find my way around. If I come back to Athens then I definitely try to stay with this guys again!<br/>The location couldn't be better, near the Syntagma Square and in the old downtown area with the best attractions. I recommend his place to anyone who wants to be in the center with a great hosts. "

13912611,131436783,2017-02-12,90670714,Kate,Staying here was great! The location was central to everything we wanted to do both in terms of the attractions and the best places to eat and going out. The building is old and beautiful but being on a busy street the sound proofing isn't great.
13912611,133224429,2017-02-21,108826919,Chris,"Unbelievable location, beautiful home, amazing hosts. Lilly, Giannis, and Mimi are sweet and helpful people. Very highly recommended!!"
13912611,135748343,2017-03-06,1498850,Evan,"Lilly, Giannis and Mimis are very warm and welcoming hosts, and very accommodating. Their house is truly unique and beautiful, and they are as eager to share it as they are to share the city of Athens. The room was very comfortable, with a wonderful small patio looking out over the street. It's in a very central area and a short walk to anything you might want to do in Athens, whether that means ruins or contemporary life. They gave us a small booklet Lilly had made of recommendations for cafes and restaurants and bars. All of the ones we followed were fantastic! Because it's central, there is street noise at night, though that is usual in Athens. The cat Betty is very friendly and lords over the hall couch. This is a great place to stay if you want to feel like part of the city."
13912611,136340153,2017-03-10,20884999,Elizabeth,"The room was exactly as depicted, and Giannis was very kind when I arrived. They were great at communicating beforehand and provided a handwritten guide of the neighborhood and their favorite places. There was some street noise from the room (which had a balcony!), but I didn't find it too be too loud and had no trouble sleeping. the location was great, as well."

13912611,145828374,2017-04-20,32400480,Jule,"This place is a jewel in the heart of Athens! Not only are the hosts really nice people who actually live in this house and make it feel very homey and cosy. The house itself is old, of course, but very beautiful and as clean as an old house can ever be. It is also located in a great area in Athens from where it is very easy to walk everywhere else, so we never had to spend any money on bus/metro tickets and just enjoyed being outside in the neighbourhood. Lilly gave us excellent tips for restaurants and things to see. Also I was prepared to a loud street (since it said so in the description of the room) but I actually felt like it was a normal city street. Not really *that* quiet of course but definitely cosier and less loud than a big street with a lot of cars. If I ever come back to Athens I would only want to stay here!"

The building and rooms are very clean and combine the spirit of a hostel and a private house where one can meet various travellers. The area is quite lively and full of life until late in night, which you should hear any way. Do not miss to relax on the rooftop terrace and have a talk to the great hosts."

The place is located in the very heart of Athens where shops and restaurants are available all around you. Metro, bus and major touristic sites are all accessible by foot.

Location is perfect, walking distance to all the ancient sites as well as the lively Plaka area. Giannis was very helpful on arrival showing us around and providing useful tips. Would recommend this place to friends. "
13912611,158725533,2017-06-08,76191705,Ashley,This would be a wonderful place for college students looking to socialize- definitely located in a hip area and there is a great falafel place downstairs. The bed was large but it sits on the ground and is very hard. But they were gracious hosts and we enjoyed our time here!

There was always someone around in the flat to ask for information or help and we enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere at Lilly, Giannis and Mimis place a lot. Great place to stay! And we will definitly come back somewhen. "
13912611,166946349,2017-07-05,11598058,Gerald,"We stayed at Lilly's place for two nights in July. The house can easily be reached from either Monastiraki (perhaps a bit closer) or Syntagma. It can be a bit noisy at night (mopeds and garbage-vans) but that's something you should expect in the middle of the city. The people are all very nice and open. If you want, you can have a late night discussion about Freud in the kitchen or just withdraw and red a book. Alisa was very helpful getting us some light for reading on the balcony. Betty, the cat, just showed up twice and did not want to be touched. Typical Kipling cat that walks by herself."

Il y avait une canicule leur de notre séjour alors l'absence de climatisation s'est fait ressentir mais la présence d'un ventilateur dans la chambre a été très agréable. Je recommande 
13912611,171845303,2017-07-19,6907358,Arnika,"Airbnb entsprach der Beschreibung, das Zimmer war schön und der Balkon wirklich malerisch. Ideal für junge, die gerne in Athen Party machen wollen und auch mal später heimkommen.

It was walking distance to the Plaka, Acropolis, flea market and airport bus stop. Our hosts were very accomodating and great communicators. If you're after a bed in a great location I highly recommend staying here. "
13912611,173186127,2017-07-23,57310087,Sol,Exactly as we needed! Athens is beautiful and our hosts made it wonderful as well. Plaka is a lovely place where to stay! 
13912611,173829632,2017-07-24,122825104,Abigail,We absolutely loved the Blue Room and staying in an old building so central in Athens. We had an adorable little balcony overlooking the street that really made us feel like locals. The hosts were so friendly. I wish we had more time to spend there!

13912611,177786260,2017-08-04,97050317,磊蕾,"The house is old, but nice and clean, the house is colorful. The location is super good, we walk to all the sights. And the shops and restaurants nearby are super convenient. <br/>You should note that there is no air conditioner here, staying in summer is not so bad but please bring ear plugs because the music in the street is pretty noisy, and you cannot close the window to block the noise or mosquitoes."
13912611,179379756,2017-08-07,132343204,CA Nishant,"The house is very ancient,having its own remarkable history and the hosts are very helpful. The best part about the house is its location. It is walkable distance from every famous tourist spot. Great locality at the centre of Athens. Bus stop, metro station, market, day tour buses, restaurants and what not, are just a street away. Highly recommend everyone to stay at this very affordable place."
13912611,180622794,2017-08-11,26414705,Giorgia,"The room and the building itself were renovated according to the host's orginal taste, which makes the overall experience quite unique. We got the chance to talk with Iannis, who is extremely nice and welcoming. Being there in August, we were feeling a bit overwhelmed by the hot temperature and the noise outside, so it was good we stayed there for two nights only."
13912611,183102783,2017-08-16,34672948,Aude,The house is well located<br/>Unfortunately there isn't air conditioning so it was extremely hot in the room

The place itself is really unique & interesting as well with a beautiful roof terrace. Definitely would recommend this place if you're looking for a place in central Athens. 
13912611,186908792,2017-08-26,122757257,Nandish,"Giannis was a great host. He was always available if we required anything. Place is very centrally located and only a few mins from syntagma station. We never required any public transport except for the airport. I found the bed a little hard and could feel the springs, but I felt that in other parts of greece as well, so not sure if the beds in greece are generally like that. At night, the place feels safe. Even though the place is centrally located, there was not much noise at night atleast not inside the room."
13912611,188044248,2017-08-28,5643195,Marine,Super appart. Hyper charmant et très bien situé. Gianni est super sympa. Petit bémol pour le confort du lit mais je recommande !

13912611,195839376,2017-09-21,18889193,Liz,"We only had the opportunity to stay with Alisa for one night, but it was a great place to stay. The room wasn't quite ready when we arrived, but Alisa kindly allowed us to leave our bags and suggested a few place right up the street to grab breakfast. After eating, we realized how central we were and we're able to walk down further to take in a few sites before heading back to the room. Once we got back Alisa showed us around the house. It's beautiful especially the balcony on the top of the house and the one right out from the room. The room was spacious and clean. The house was very close to the Acropolis as well as many food places. The train stop was about a 10m walk to the house and made travel back and forth convenient. I would recommend this place to others."

13912611,200653878,2017-10-06,93780467,Martin,I visited athens for a conference and the apartment's location was ideally situated! I could still visit everything i wanted to see despite the fact that i was stuck at the conference all day. Alisa help me to find my way from the airport to the aprtment and the conference location. The room was very clean with everything that you would need! During the evenin/night there was some noise outside the house but honestly if you want to have a great location to experience the oldtown of athens a little noise Is just the price to pay! I can recommend staying there!

The location is absolutely fantastic!! You are in the heart of the city. Walking distance to all major sites! We actually arrived much earlier than expected and even though our room wasn't ready yet, Alisa was so accommodating and let us hang out on the rooftop patio until our room was ready. Because of the location it is quite noisy at night so bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. Thank you so much Alisa!"

Alisa is amazing and very informative, Mimi aka Mr. Philosopher is the greatest person to strike a conversation with & Yannis is super sweet! All 3 of them combined, I would say you hit the jackpot, my sister and I felt very lucky to have them and basically give us a run down of the area. They made us feel at home and would definitely stay with them again!"

13912611,210578012,2017-11-10,9262348,Eimear,What a gorgeous house! It is the perfect opportunity to stay in a genuine Athens home and Alisa was such a welcoming host. The location is fabulous if you want to be close to Syntagma Square (for the bus to the airport) and close to a great selection of bars and restaurants. I liked this place so much that I've already booked another stay there.

13912611,211768870,2017-11-14,9089665,Felipe,"Amazing Airbnb. This is definitely a more artistic, bohemian Airbnb, but it is absolutely fantastic. The room is large with high ceilings, and the bed is low to the ground. The building looks like it would be cold, but it was quite warm. Also, it is a historic building - which is cool. The hosts also gave a pamphlet or recommendations for nice places to go in town. Overall, it was very nice and relaxing. I would 100% recommend it from my experience."
13912611,218812737,2017-12-15,162003835,O,"The house is exactly as described, location is in the middle of everything, many things are in a walking distance. I enjoyed my stay. Yannis is the man, very helpful. Alice is very attentive and prompt. Thank you all."

13912611,226187051,2018-01-09,43756620,Anestis,I was just spent a night at Alice's place to catch a morning flight. Her warm welcoming and the cozy room with soft  matress she offered me was more than enough. Thanks a lot!
13912611,227159527,2018-01-14,166177524,可,"虽然是1840年的老房子,但是装修非常时尚,房间层高很高,看上去非常大气｡房间里还有暖气,待在里面很舒服｡宪法广场步行不到10分钟,周围很安全,吃饭去景点都很方便,所有都步行可达,以至于除了从机场到市区,我们没有坐过一次公交和地铁｡房东人非常好,我们2个人住,房东又额外在地上给我们铺了一张床垫｡唯一需要注意的是晚上有车从楼下经过,会有一点响声,建议睡觉时塞上耳塞｡总之,强烈推荐!"

This place is a must to consider place. Everything is fantastic no negative comments from my side. The kitchens & decorations are also beautiful and need no improvement. The hosts are so friendly and openminded."

13912611,258968908,2018-04-30,22153000,Emilie,L’appartement est en plein centre d’Athènes. Tous les sites touristiques ainsi que les restaurants sont accessibles rapidement à pied. Les hôtes sont très réactifs et très accueillant (même tard dans la nuit). Les sanitaires partagés sont nettoyés chaque jour. La hauteur sous plafond et le balcon de la chambre sont des plus indéniable.
13912611,260526598,2018-05-04,82217435,Sarah,"We had a great stay here!! The hosts were very kind and hospitable. You could not ask for a better location here. Very close walking distance to everything! Of course with that comes a lot of street noise, but no complaints:) my only suggestion would be to put a fan in the room because it got pretty hot with no AC. But other than that, everything was great!! Would totally stay here again."
13912611,261818963,2018-05-07,175595382,Zhelan,"这间房子离商业区非常非常近,如果你是一个喜欢购物的人,这里绝对值得首选｡Alis是一个非常开朗､漂亮的姑娘,我们都很喜欢她｡房间很古朴让我们体验了上世纪的感觉｡非常棒!<br/>This house is very close to the business district. If you are a person who likes shopping, it is definitely worth the first choice. Alis is a very cheerful and beautiful girl. We all like her very much. The room was very rustic and let us experience the feeling of the last century. Great!"
13912611,263424640,2018-05-12,2593455,Kelly,Great location with lots of shops and restaurants in the vicinity. Walking distance to most of the attractions. Room is however not recommended  for the light sleepers. Noises from the street lasted till late in the night.
13912611,266068269,2018-05-19,48781759,Isa,"Excellent location, however you must not be too sensible against noise, because there is quite a lot of traffic and many bars around. If you like historic buildings you will be impressed, since the building is from the mid 19th century. The room has a wonderful balcony and is light flooded.<br/>Our hosts we very friendly and welcoming, giving us a little self made booklet about Athens and good places to eat etc.<br/>Quite a few people were using the bathroom, but our hosts kept the bathroom clean during our stay which we appreciated a lot.<br/>Everything was perfect, just from times to times a little too much smoking in the apartment."
13912611,267641279,2018-05-22,160234631,Hoa,"Alisa place was great. The location was perfect for me and my fiance. It was close to all the shop, restaurant, and popular sites. We only stay in Athens for 1 day so we need a place that close to everything and this was perfect. Alisa was very fast in response to our messages. Check in was easy and fast. We had a great experience at Alisa place."

13912611,268815588,2018-05-26,41945236,Britt,"If you’re looking for a place to stay in Athens, THIS is it. The place was about a 15 minute walk to Acropolis and less than 10 minute walk from everything in the city center (shops, restaurant, the metro if need be). As for the place, it is most stylish. The rooms are big, spacious and colorful and so are the bathrooms. I also had a great time getting to know my hosts and they were very generous :) I would recommend this place to anyone traveling in Athens. "

Alisa and Yannis are wonderful hosts, and the house is perfectly located for getting around the key attractions. There are restaurants and shops all around. Our only  complaint is that we didn't spend enough time there. We hope to return some day! <br/>The value is is excellent for the area. I imagine if you are someone accustomed to fancy 5 star hotels costing $500 dollars you could be disappointed, but for someone with reasonable expectations this was a delightful surprise."
13912611,274006948,2018-06-08,59961733,Dorota,"Wow this place is just amazing! the hosts are extremely nice and helpful but completely not interfere to your space.

Le logement se situe au centre d'Athènes, dans un quartier animé et proche de tous les principaux sites touristiques.  Le logent est facile d'accès que ce soit à partir du Pirée ou de l’aéroport.  J'ai énormément apprécié l'accueil chaleureux qui m'a été réservé: il s'agit d'une grande maison à l’ambiance auberge espagnole avec une agréable terrasse sur le toit où partager des bières entre amis.  Je recommande ce logement à tous ceux qui veulent vivre une expérience typiquement athénienne."

The room is extremely central to all of Athen’s main sights and even the hidden gems. <br/><br/>The room is comfortable and chic.

However, a few improvements could be made which would enhance their accommodation, like the shower head not being stable and the door to the balcony requiring expert knowhow to secure it against the high winds and noise.The fact that road works were being carried out in the early hours was not their fault and possibly the price one has to pay for central location."
13912611,330841838,2018-10-01,25611256,Denise,"Amazing place! It is walkable to not one, but two metro stations. Staying here, you wont actually need to take public transport to see the main sights because they are all nearby and within walking distance. Perfect location! Alis was a great host, and also the other guy (didn’t get his name, Giannis i think?) We had heavy luggage, and they both helped us to bring it up the stairs. Lots of food and shopping around, which makes the place pretty noisy at night. But we loved every minute of it."

L'emplacement de l'appartement est idéal pour découvrir la ville, on est en plein centre, mais c'est aussi son seul défaut : le bruit. C'est un quartier très sonore. Mais des bouchons d'oreilles sont en libre service dans l'entrée donc tout est bien qui fini bien :) Bien entendu pour les dormeurs légers qui n'aiment pas les bouchons d'oreilles, ce n'est pas idéal. Malgré ça, gros coup de coeur sur ce Airbnb, je recommande"
13912611,349384809,2018-11-17,126754091,Bernard,The apartment is easily accessible and convenient. It is located in the heart of the city. It is also clean and very cozy. Alisa was very communicative and caring. Overall our stay here was pleasant.
13912611,349810918,2018-11-18,65488849,Elliott,"Incredibly quick to respond to messages, a lovely home where I felt very welcome. The location is unbeatable and overall fantastic value for money. Being a central location and a listed building it’s only single glazing so make sure to pick up a set of the ear plugs provided. Highly recommend!"
13912611,350726760,2018-11-20,45887281,Quentin,The place is very well located and we had a warm welcome and easy communication! <br/>Only negative point is the neighbourhood that is quite active at night. Earplugs will make this place the best value is Athens for sure!
13912611,352421011,2018-11-25,212884460,硕,"I have to say that the resturant downstairs is sooooo good!!! The location is wonderful! And the hosts are soooo nice and sweet and helfpul & their cat so cute! The only thing I find a little annoying is the nearby clubs are a little too loud at night, so probably it's not suitable for people having trouble getting to sleep."
13912611,355181783,2018-12-03,219232427,Ruzha,really nice place in the center of Athens

The blue room and the apartment itself were beautiful and welcoming and the location is perfect. You can reach a lot of things by walking like the famous rooftop bars with the view over the acropolis. Souvenir shops, flee markets, amazing street food, bars and restaurants are all around.  <br/>A big thank you!"
13912611,362752696,2018-12-27,199952448,Nay,"Alis' place was really perfect for our needs. Clean toilets, a working washer, a spacious room, and best of all, an absolutely killer location right smack in the center of town near Syntagma Square. The home is very close to awesome restaurants and eateries which open even on the 1st and 2nd days of Christmas when almost everything was closed. All in all, I'm a satisfied guest. Thank you Alis!"

And all nice places in town on walking distance. Restaurant and bars available in the street. A bit noisy on the Friday evening with people going out, so don’t come here for the quietness."
13912611,456629855,2019-05-22,64925961,Agata,"Pokój w samym centrum Aten, blisko do głównych atrakcji. Alisa jest bardzo gościnną osobą, mieliśmy dostęp do wszystkiego czego potrzebowaliśmy. Polecamy jej dom na zwiedzanie Aten!"

13912611,461169920,2019-05-31,124694230,Benoit,"The blue piano room at this place is lovely. The house is big and very clean. The hosts are exceptional, they waited for us until very late our arrival day. <br/>Excellent location, you can walk to every attraction !"
13912611,463362195,2019-06-03,252350619,Jessica,"This was a great place to stay! The room was nice and the location was fantastic. There is so much to do and see all within easy walking distance. This isnt the place to stay if you're looking for a quiet place to stay, but if you want to be surrounded by Athenian culture and night life, it's great."

13912611,471762169,2019-06-18,83203927,Shelby,"Unbeatable location! My husband and I loved exploring Athen’s amazing historical sites and great restaurants/shops located right outside this Airbnb doorstep. The building is clean and we appreciated the thoughtful bathroom amenities left out for guests. There is no AC in the building and Athens is hot in the summer. There is a great fan in the room to keep you cool. So, just prepare yourself accordingly. Thank you again for a great stay!"
13912611,474315943,2019-06-23,21129222,Eno,"Awesome location!

13912611,475900751,2019-06-25,15713072,Henri,"Perfect location and cosy atmosphere. The host was very nice and responsive! <br/>Our only problem was with heat since we were staying on a hot day(36c) and there is no AC,  the heat made sleeping uncomfortable. Note that we are used to Nordic climate so we may be more sensitive about it.."
13912611,477399169,2019-06-28,242322817,Lucia,Todo excelente. Muy amable a la llegada y a la salida.

She is a lovely host and the apartment is very spacious and has many nice extras such as the rooftop terrace. I can't imagine a better location if you want to explore Athens in a few days since the apartment is directly in the vibrant city centre. Would highly recommend this airbnb to everyone!
13912611,480249306,2019-07-02,11246268,Evan,"Beautiful room in a great location. Very close to many of the attractions and the heart of the city.

13912611,488540610,2019-07-15,252007092,Paul,A big room with a balcony. Shared kitchen and bathroom were a good size as well. <br/><br/>There is a bar and an outdoor seating restaurant that both go till late and currently a building being fitted out a couple of doors down. Windows closed blocks most of the noise but I did use ear plugs to sleep while the power tools were active. Atmosphere on the balcony in the evening is lovely.<br/><br/>No ac but a big fan is provided.
13912611,493911042,2019-07-23,38824933,Kamila,"We have stayed in the blue piano room for 2 nights and enjoyed it very much. The bed was big and very comfortable to sleep on. My favourite was a little charming balcony which belonged to our room. I appreciated the access to two bathrooms and the kitchen too. The house is perfectly located, right in the middle of restaurant/shop areas and with a walking distance to many tourist attractions. It is not a quite neighborhood but it was honestly mentioned in the place description. All in all, a good choice! Check-in/check-out process was very simple, thanks Alis for staying up late on our arrival day!"
13912611,494873011,2019-07-25,80922858,Anton,"Alisa has woken up in the middle of the night just to meet us at the entrance and let us in! We enjoyed our stay at this charming and romantic apartment with a great street view from the balcony. We recommend to stay here and feel the morning vibes drinking coffee from nearby cafeteria. The location is superb for walking: 10-15min to Acropolis or Plaka, 5min to Monastiraki or Food market."
13912611,496127495,2019-07-27,27774789,Furkan,"The location is so close to the center. The house, bathroom and room is so clean and safety. They are so helpful. Thanks a lot for everything."
13912611,498060881,2019-07-29,5081843,Irina,"Unbeatable location - very close to many famous places of Athens such as Acropolis, Syntagma square, Monastiraki, Ermou street. Really convenient to reach from/to airport, around 7 minutes on foot to X95 bus stop and Syntagma subway station. Communication with Alisa was excellent, she always replied us fast and was ready to meet at any time even when our flight was delayed. The apartment looks precious with its charm of classic style building having high ceilings, spacious and cosy rooms, old-fashioned kitchen with marble sink and stairs to sunny terrace. Our Blue Piano Room was big enough and had a pretty balcony to sit in the evenings. Bathroom was equipped with practically everything - shampoos, soap etc. even with washing machine. Under the apartment on the ground floor there is a good cafe with tasty and inexpensive dishes working till late at night. <br/>The only con I'd like to say is the absence of A/C, but it is clearly written in the description, you just have to consider that if you are going to stay here in summer. At least there was a fan which really helped us."

13912611,512074713,2019-08-18,63278402,Mareike,"The room was just wonderful. The privat balcony was perfect in the morning for a cup of coffee. The shared bathroom and kitchen just next to the room. It was quiet hot in the room during our stay and spicy outside, but just as described before. We had a good time :)"

13912611,654124851,2020-08-21,265140780,Βαγγελης,21 Αυγούστου!! Είχε γενέθλια η κοπέλα μου και της έκανα έκπληξη το blue room με το υπέροχο πιάνο στην κρεβατοκάμαρα. Όλα πολύ όμορφα. Υπήρχε καθαριότητα και ησυχία. Το μπάνιο και η κουζίνα ήταν κοινόχρηστοι χώροι στην αρχή παρεξενευτηκα αλλά μια χαρά. Το μπάνιο και το δωμάτιο πάρα πολύ καθαρό και το μπαλκόνι υπέροχο. Ενώ η Αθηναϊκή ζωή έδινε μία αλλη αίσθηση διαμονής. Αν θα έβαζα κάτι στα μειονεκτήματα θα ήταν η έλλειψη κλιματισμού! Κάποια στιγμή θα πρέπει να την επανδρώσετε. Κατά τα άλλα ολα ήταν υπέροχα

She even allowed me to check out later than usual,  which made me day in Athens so much easier.<br/>As she says jn her description, it is a nice and lively neighbourhood. The bar down the road has music until midnight which I could hear from the room.  But in that area of Athens, it is nowhere totally silent.<br/>It is perfectly situated to just walk over to the nice places in Plaka."

Because of COVID-19 we had a very low interaction, but in the room we found a ""book"" with the rules of house, some tips about what to visit, where to eat, WiFi password, so on... The apartment has a central location in the city so, if you don't have a problem with the noise, everything it's OK!"

Our favourite part was a balcony, which is on top of a lively street with a lot of restaurants. The only inconvenience was lack of AC (it was super hot in Athens during our stay), other than that everything was perfect."

La habitación está muy bien ubicada (se puede caminar a todos los sitios de interés histórico y de fiestas fácilmente), además se ofrece un desayuno barato y sabroso. Tal vez no lo recomendaría a las personas de sueño liviano, ya que hay un bar algo ruidoso cerca, pero la verdad es que a nosotros no nos afectó para nada. Llegas tan cansado de recorrer la ciudad que te duermes fácilmente. 5/5"

It was also equipped with all the necessary amenities and even a little balcony that overlooks the street. Alisa was a kind host - she made sure I had everything I needed and that I felt welcome. She also has a cafe down the street where she makes really great coffee and snacks (would highly recommend checking it out during your stay). Thank you so much Alisa!!"

13919907,162678253,2017-06-22,28605839,Meetu,This accomodation is situated very close to public transport and walking distance to some of Athens main attractions. Our host Harry was very easy to communicate with and the property was spacious four our group (4 adults and one child).

13919907,170360933,2017-07-15,11305919,Franziska,Great and quiet area to stay in Athens - restaurants etc. in walking distance and not far from the so called 'commercial triangle' around the Acropolis ! Definitely a very nice and safe neighborhood.
13919907,173297899,2017-07-23,120790868,Alyssa,"We had 8 people stay and we were all comfortable. Harry was very accommodating with our check-in process. He let us come a couple hours early to drop off our bags while the rooms were being cleaned which helped immensely as we were coming off a long travel day. Apartment was located in a nice, quiet area but was easy to access the sites. The apartment was a 5 min walk from a bus stop that took us to and from the airport and only took about 40-50 mins each way. We recommend staying with Harry! "
13919907,175623704,2017-07-29,50929074,Ludovic,Bon emplacement proche de la ligne de métro venant de l aéroport 
13919907,177179012,2017-08-02,2501592,Betsy,"Harry is an absolutely lovely host. He is responsive, very helpful, quick to fix anything. He could not have been nicer. He also seems like a very kind person. The apartment(s) are very well located in a beautiful residential neighborhood in Kolonaki. The street is beautiful and quiet with lovely trees and flowers. The apartment is a bit worn and not as beautiful as the photos suggest, but this is a very small complaint, given how large the apartment(s) and how perfect the location."
13919907,178800181,2017-08-06,2610697,Andrea,"Harry was extremely flexible and he offered quick responses. It was a pleasure to deal with him.  The condos are clean, need a little TLC, and one AC in the apartment is not enough in the August summer heat.  But overall, we had a great experience and would recommend this place.  The location is close to everything, and the area is very safe, next to all the UK embassy and all other embassies."

13919907,222187710,2017-12-29,3696844,Vijay,overall a good place. very good location.
13919907,248801806,2018-04-01,15349821,Ravi,"Harry's place was one of the worst experiences with AirBnB we have had. On positive side, the location is central and near to Metro as stated - Harry was kind enough to help us find the place when we were lost due to taxi miscommunication. On Negative side, the house itself needs lots of updating - To be clear, the photos on website are professionally done, but the actual place is run down, old, and weary. Furniture's old, kitchen insufficient and small, bath-rooms shabby and even the doors of bathrooms don't close. Taps don't work properly including hot water that was inconsistently available. The beds creak even when one changes sides while sleeping. Overall, it was an experience we would like to forget."
13919907,249850077,2018-04-03,32326063,Lucie,"The reality does not correspond at all to photos.<br/>The place is really dirty, mold and in a poor condition. It is dark, the street is quite noisy.<br/>We needed to cancel our trip."
13919907,259465803,2018-05-01,2607347,Prashant,"The apartment is little old style with big hall and bedroom but very compact bathroom,and small kitchen.<br/>The location is superb with lots of options to eat nearby and metro station is also on walkable distance. <br/>The bathroom in big apartment has no hooks to hang your clothes and no locks too. It is very uncomfortable to bath as you feel cramped for space.<br/>Kitchen also has very less space to move around.<br/>Overall a decent place to stay."

You can not get a better location, right in the middle of everything (shopping, reataurants bars, train station, sightseeing) and the street has a nice neighbhood feel and is quiet.

John has made the apartment feel very comfortable with amenities, it has a very inviting feel to it. You will not be disappointed!"

He happened to be out of town the day we arrived but made sure his sister was there at the exact time we arrived so she could let us in and show us the place. John was always quick to respond to our messages and was very helpful. The apartment was beautiful. It was exceptionally clean. The wifi worked very well. The porch was very nice as well. It was in a great location in the heart of Plaka a stones throw from the Acropolis and central shopping district. Tons of great restaurants around. Great place!
13951605,98636729,2016-09-01,85554204,Frances,"The taxi driver didnt know the address, so he rang John, who talked him through it, and he met us at the door. Both John and the apartment were lovely. He even made an extra stop by and left us coffee pods for the machine which was so thoughtful, and made my mum's whole trip! Very tasteful apartment, and in such an ideal location! Every 'must see' in Athens is within walking distance. 10/10 would recommend :)"

Nous avons aimé notre séjour dans ce quartier d Athènes qui, tout en étant proche des sites à visiter, est préservé des foules de touristes. Jhon est quant à lui un hôte très serviable, il nous a aidé pour organiser notre  séjours, contact facile et réponses à chaque fois précises et très complètes. Nous recommandons vivement John et son appart, la grande terrasse sera la cerise sur le gâteau, très appréciable le soir!"
13951605,102205484,2016-09-17,29803768,Luana,"This appartement was the perfect setting to discover Athens, which was a great city to visit! It's located perfectly, close to upcoming restaurants, shops and on walking distance from important places in the city. But then again, in a neighbourhood were not to much tourist walk by. We loved the apartment that was really clean, perfectly accommodated, nicely decorated and not to forget the lovely balcony! Although we didn't see John, he was a perfect host! And little side note, who doesn't like an airbnb where even the shampoo smells like figs? :) "
13951605,103321599,2016-09-21,12074703,Corrine,"Beautiful flat in the midst of it all, without feeling swamped by Athens. John met me at the flat on arrival with a fridge full of bottled water, milk and beer. A great way to start! You're right in the middle of foodie area of 
<br/>Athens with loads of amazing restaurants in every direction. The terrace is a great place to have a drink and relax. Great flat, thanks John! "
13951605,103534799,2016-09-23,13049257,Cameron,"We had a great stay at John's apartment. It was clean, modern and everything worked perfectly. Lovely outdoor terrace which doubled the floor space and provided a cool area to relax. The bed was comfortable and the small sofa doubled as a single bed. The apartment is small with no separate living area but it was all we needed and we spent most of the time on the terrace anyway. There's a nice, modern seperate kitchen too with a Nespresso machine and free pods. John even left some beer in the fridge for us. He was friendly, helpful and prompt with replies. Would definitely stay again and recommend to friends. "
13951605,104874735,2016-09-29,64788580,Max,All was great and John was super helpful.   A great little pad in a convenient cool central area.
13951605,105241538,2016-10-01,37456673,Tristan,"John is such a great host, he communicated with us early to ensure arrangements were made for our arrival and was there to greet us when we arrived, to show us around the apartment and provide information about Athens. His apartment is in an ideal location for exploring Athens and in such close proximity to the old town, which we explored on foot, and very close to a high concentration of great eateries and cafe's within the surrounding blocks of his property. The apartment was spotlessly clean and very comfortable for a travelling couple."
13951605,106248658,2016-10-05,909163,Adi,"The apartment was absolutely gorgeous. John has thought of every single detail - from the tiny soaps and shampoos with the most amazing smell, through a very equipped kitchen, to plenty of storage space for your luggage. It was beautifully designed, plus the balcony was a real treat - wide and sunny with a great shade.
<br/>
<br/>The location was just in the middle of everything - close to the Plaka and the Acropolis, and to the coolest restaurants and bars but still very quite. 
<br/>
<br/>John was an excellent host. Made sure all the way that nothing was missing.
<br/>Thank you so much for having us!"

13951605,107879801,2016-10-13,5115036,Joël,"John's appartement is exactly what I was looking for. The location is perfect, since you can reach really nice bar, restaurant and almost every tourist spots by foot. Although the neighborhood is very lively, the appartement is quiet, since it is located on the top floor of the building. I really enjoyed my stay at John's place and would definitely recommend it. Thanks again!"
13951605,108372064,2016-10-16,60683787,Jimmy,"John was great when we arrived late at 8pm , we made the mistake of not using the elevator because it was on the top floor. He also provided us with bottle of water and beer to start our evening right after a long flight. The bacony was the best . Will be here again if in Athens."

There is a great large balcony where we had breakfast in the mornings. The location is fantastic, close to many cool bars and restaurants, within the Plaka district and walking distance to the Acropolis. It was easy to reach from the airport. There is a biomarket for groceries across the street. John met us at the apartment and was very helpful and kind throughout. We highly recommend that people stay here when visiting Athens! Thanks again! "

13951605,126899098,2017-01-15,49650730,Ares,"This is a great place if you want to be in the town centre. You are only 5 minutes on foot from the main square (Syntagma), another 5 minutes from the High Street (Ermou), and another 5 to the old town. On the last floor of a building, this is a quiet, small and very clean appartment that has everything you need. We were there in the winter, but it was not cold at all. My guess is that in spring you can enjoy the terrace, too. "

The apartment was at a great location in relation the tourist areas, restaurants and the metro. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to see. The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. We loved the balcony. Our only complaint was that we heard everything outside and it got really cold at night despite using the heaters. Other than that I do recommend staying here because the location is perfect and it has everything you need for a vacation."

Depuis l'aéroport, 40min de métro puis une marche de 5 minutes pour arriver à l'appartement.<br/>Nous avons eu un petit soucis avec la douche les 2 premiers jours, mais John a tout fait pour réparer le problème et était même prêt à appeler un plombier. Le problème est partit tout seul, sans doute dû à des travaux dans la rue. <br/>En dehors de ça, l'appartement de John est vraiment bien, et si nous devions retourner à Athènes, nous retournerons chez lui !<br/>Très à l'écoute John répond aussitôt aux messages en cas de besoin et se plie en 4 pour les personnes qu'il accueil."

13951605,216862900,2017-12-06,14644984,Annika,John was a really nice host. We had a great time in his little apartment and enjoyed the beautiful terrace a lot. We will definitely come back.
13951605,218155541,2017-12-11,21931222,Kate,"Johns place is wonderful. Right in the center of everything, pretty, high ceilings, giant balcony. Highly recommend."
13951605,219828725,2017-12-19,133668501,Sokratis,Great apartment at the very centre of Athens
13951605,221899860,2017-12-28,30278266,Deepa,Such a great place / John is super responsive and helpful.
13951605,224437334,2018-01-03,31159791,Ioana,"We had an amazing stay at John's home. The flat is very stilish, clean and comfortable and we particularly enjoyed the big terrace. It is the perfect size for a couple or solo traveler. The location is ideal - walking distance to the Acropolis and all museums. John also allowed us to check out a bit later which was helpful.  The only downside was that sometimes the water pressure dropped so low that it was hard to shower but I think this was something to do with the building (and it was only at certain hours not all the time) so it didn't deter from our otherwise great experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for total comfort in downtown Athens."
13951605,227512890,2018-01-15,25539825,Alan,"John’s place is very centrally located right off Syntagma Square (easy to get to from the Airport via Metro...if there are no strikes) yet the street also has a fairly residential feel. (If you are from NYC my wife and I agreed that the area felt a bit like East Village in a good way.) There are many great restaurants literally next door and many more that are a close walk. The apartment itself was cozy and clean. There is a large balcony almost doubling the size of the apartment. Note that there is no TV as pictured but the the WiFi is good. Finally John was very easy to reach, responded quickly if I needed help, and provided many great recommendations."
13951605,229564901,2018-01-24,152956092,Johannes,Cozy apartment at the heart of Athens - Perfect for two people. Everything was clean and well organized. John provided us with some recommendations for local food places/bars and was in general super responsive and helpful. The apartment is located in a nice area with lots of small food places and 10 min. from the acropolis. Only downside – we went in January and the place was a little hard to get heated up.
13951605,230821558,2018-01-29,3037031,Dorothea,"Der Aufenthalt bei John war super. Die Wohnung hat eine perfekte Lage, die für unseren Trip super gepasst hat. Besonders schön an der Wohnung ist der Balkon, der so groß wie ein extra Zimmer ist und auf dem man morgens immer Sonne hat. John war sehr hilfsbereit, immer gut zu erreichen und hat uns viele tips gegeben. Er ist uns außerdem mit der abreisezeit total entgegen gekommen und wir konnten unsere Sachen noch in der Wohnung lassen.<br/>Ich würde die Unterkunft voll und ganz weiter empfehlen."
13951605,231659449,2018-02-02,5213863,Nona,The apartment is in a great location just  blocks from syntagma and great neighborhood. The apartment is new and very clean. The balcony is a gem. The apartment is amazing and I highly recommend staying here. John is very easy to communicate with.
13951605,233324890,2018-02-09,151661974,Kong,Great amenities and host is helpful and quick to response!
13951605,235579864,2018-02-17,43198999,Melissa,Wonderful flat with a beautiful balcony. Location is fantastic. John is a great host. I've stayed twice now.
13951605,237754037,2018-02-24,13295009,Polona,"Fabulous location, wonderful apartment, amazing terrace and friendly host - all we needed for an unforgettable stay in Athens! Thank you!"
13951605,238839544,2018-02-27,32974850,Javier,"Lovely apartment, great terrace, super clean and very central. John was v friendly and gave great recommendations. We had a great time at his apartment."
13951605,239537719,2018-03-02,4904676,Flora,"Everything was great. The apartment is super cute, the location perfect and the bed is so comfortable!<br/>John is really a super host!"
13951605,240988419,2018-03-07,114712042,Pilar,"Si queréis un sitio estupendamente ubicado, cerca del metro, de lugares muy buenos para comer, de la acrópolis, Monastiraki, Plaka... no lo penséis dos veces: este es EL SITIO"
13951605,244112808,2018-03-18,3098117,Elizabeth,Great central location. It was ten minutes from Acropolis restaurants and less for nice bars. The neighborhood was lovely and felt safe. The apartment was clean with a nice patio for morning coffee and tea and fast wifi. One small surprise was that the hot water for a shower takes 20 mins to heat up. Would recommend staying here if you can!
13951605,245962283,2018-03-24,4297876,Simon,Location location location so close to everything and the neighborhood is lovely
13951605,247056988,2018-03-27,3758391,Lotta,"John's apartment was perfect for our short trip to Athens. There is a big sunny terrace, it's nicely furnished and the location is great - you got plenty of coffee shops, restaurants and everything nearby. The communication was very easy, John answered really quickly, as the check-in was easy to do as well. <br/>We would recommend!"
13951605,249324822,2018-04-02,3182299,Kira Elisabeth,"Great apartment with an amazing balcony, where you can enjoy your morning coffee (John left some great nespresso coffee capsules for the machine). <br/><br/>The flat is modern, clean and has the best location on a quiet street in Plaka. We only had issues with the water pressure dropping, when the second person showered, so be aware of that when getting ready in the morning. <br/><br/>We really enjoyed our stay at John’s flat and can definitely recommend it."
13951605,252098904,2018-04-09,16791071,Ian,Top location. Not a large apartment but does have a large covered balcony which is fine in the warmer months. Would recommend to friends and likely book this again when next in Athens.
13951605,257662122,2018-04-27,105908144,Paul,"Very nice appartment.  Good location. It is central , near Syntagma square so metro a jump from there as is the tram , the busses, the troley's... And then there are so many restaurants in the neighbourhood! Get some take away and eat it on the terrace.... loved my stay there. And very clean! Thank you John."
13951605,259463509,2018-05-01,5997561,Niki,John was very responsive and answered questions immediately - the flat was cosy and we had a wonderful huge terrace!! Most exciting was the location directly next to most of the spots to see!
13951605,261208301,2018-05-06,109350901,Rachael,"John’s place was the perfect location for our trip to Athens. He’s not kidding when he says it’s close to all of the coolest (and most delicious) foodie spots. We had some of our best meals just steps away from the apartment. The space itself was perfect for the two of us - very tidy, simple and extremely convenient. The outdoor space is incredible and was the best place to enjoy a bottle of wine before or after dinner. We would definitely come back!"
13951605,262790403,2018-05-10,51080488,Mark,"John’s flat is in a great location on the edge of the central tourist areas with some excellent cafes, restaurants and bars within a few hundred metres. The flat is clean and well thought out and the main balcony is a really nice space to have access to. We would stay again"
13951605,264530497,2018-05-14,66117004,Rachel,"Great location and wonderful flat very close to plaka. The flat itself was very clean, small but also perfect for 2 people. It was on a great street next to some amazing restaurants. John was very helpful and responded very quickly."
13951605,268225205,2018-05-24,20008950,Tim,We had a wonderful time at the flat. The area is perfect to explore the city! Very nice host and lovely flat.
13951605,269805767,2018-05-28,123727161,Päivi,"Asunto vastasi hyvin siitä kirjoitettua ja kuvattua esittelyä: siisti, pieni ja compakti keskusta-asunto. Sinne on erittäin helppo löytää ja sijainti on mitä mainioin. Metroasema on vain muutaman sadan metrin päässä, ihan nurkalla löytyy lukuisia ravintoloita, ruokakauppa ja monet tärkeät nähtävyydet ovat lyhyen kävelymatkan päässä. Olin reissussa yksin, joten arvostin tätä keskeistä mutta silti rauhallista sijaintia erityisen paljon. Parveke on iso ja sinne paistaa hyvin aurinko aamusta reippaasti iltapäivään. Varsinainen oleskelutila on sisällä pieni, mutta minä ainakin vietän parvekkeella mielelläni aikaa, sen minkä kaupungillaolon ja nukkumisen välillä satun olemaan paikalla. John  oli  ystävällinen, huomaavainen ja hänen kanssaan oli helppo kommunikoida.  Olen tyytyväinen valintaani."
13951605,271022711,2018-05-31,120313977,Jeremy,"The location of John's apartment can't be beat! It's a 5 mins walk to the Syntama Square station and a 15 mins walk to the Acropolis, Acropolis museum and Plaka. Also near to the shops so perfect for those who wish to shop and then head back to the apartment to drop off the shopping. It's located in the ""nicer"" part of Syntama Square, quiet and away from the hustlers. John's description of the apartment itself being on foodie street is accurate! It's within a 5 mins radius to so many great restaurants.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is as pictured. The decoration is modern. Although it is not a huge space, but it's extremely well laid out and compact. As such, the space is suitable for 2 pax with 2 large opened suitcases. The lovely spacious balcony was so inviting and Nespresso coffee caps were on the house!<br/><br/>But the best part of the apartment is John himself. Although we did not meet him, he was easily contactable and answered all our enquiries and gave us retaurant recommendations. We ran into some problems on our last evening, and John helped us immediately and was very patient and reassuring. <br/><br/>The entire experience certainly helped us to have a pleasant stay in Athens. Highly recommended!!"
13951605,272143352,2018-06-03,16319625,Maryse,John's appartment is really well located. Easy to access and useful places to visit were provided. We really liked staying there. Thanks!
13951605,273478942,2018-06-06,2094482,Katherine,"John’s place was really convenient to transit and all of the things we wanted to be close to. We were able to take the train to and from the airport and we were able to walk to all of the restaurants we wanted to indulge in. Having the elevator is amazing especially on a long trip. The size is really perfect for a couple. Clean sheets and towels were waiting on arrival. Check in was really easy through the use of a lockbox and had instructions with pictures which made everything super simple. When an issue came up with the ac unit John was extremely fast in getting the issue resolved and I felt supported every step of the way. John is very quick to respond via messages, a very communicative host. Definitely recommend. Was a great place to stay.  "
13951605,276208289,2018-06-13,50526525,Amanda,"John was an awesome host. His communication was amazing! He always responded quickly and provided very clear details of how to check in, which we appreciated. There are so many fantastic food options near John’s place and I’m sad we didn’t have time to try more! It is also located near great bars. It is  conveniently located to the syntagma metro station, lots of buses, and was in a spot where you could really walk anywhere you needed, including  he Acropolis for us. You’re able to take the metro down to the port and travel to some of the closer islands, which was great! John’s place was clean, cool, and decorated beautifully. I couldn’t have asked for a better stay in Athens and would definitely stay again! Thanks John! "
13951605,278469583,2018-06-18,29591650,Dlorean,"Fantastic location and space. You seriously can't beat it in value. Most sights are about a 15 min walk away. Also, there are plenty of great places to eat in the area. I wouldn't trade this place for a hotel unless that hotel was the Ritz."
13951605,280329423,2018-06-23,47360777,Jaryd,Perfect location. Close to all the action yet in a quiet street. John is easy to communicate with. Highly recommend
13951605,282343410,2018-06-27,110383410,Sally,"Super convenient location on a quiet side street that is a 5 - 15 minute walk from pretty much everywhere you want to go in Athens....the Acropolis, shopping in the Plaka, numerous restaurants, museums, Botanic gardens, etc.  Large and comfortable covered balcony that was a great addition to the space, with a lovely breeze, and perfect for breakfast or a glass of wine.  John is very responsive and helpful with tips.  Self check-in is easy.  Top floor in a quiet building with an elevator.  And the best hair dryer I've found in any hotel or other airbnb!!"
13951605,288904951,2018-07-11,4173981,Lisa,As per all the reviews we can only agree it's an amazing apartment and the best location and neighbourhood to stay in.
13951605,292126707,2018-07-17,6431396,Joshua,"Basic apartment right in the center of Athens. Excellent location for sightseeing and food/drink, and John is a very friendly, responsive host. Only drawback is that the flat gets quite hot in the Athens summer (even with the air conditioner running)."
13951605,296200582,2018-07-25,130385088,Fabio,"We had a wonderful short stay at John’s apartment. It’s a perfect location if you’re wanting to explore Athens city, in a quiet and safe street. Thank you John! "
13951605,298981959,2018-07-30,55602488,Evangelos,Nice little place in a great area. Located on a quiet street in a lively neighborhood only minutes away by foot to most Athenian must see destinations. 
13951605,302726775,2018-08-06,30585753,Suraj,"The apartment was exactly as advertised. It is small, but it's good because it is so close to the Syntagma metro and bus station. Lot of restaurants in the vicinity and it's close to Ermou street as well. Check and check out was easy. "
13951605,304165721,2018-08-09,202107483,Claire,John's place is so amazing! We only worked with John through messages but everything was as he said it would be.  Our late check-in and early check-out was easy with the lock box outside of the house. The location was perfect to get anywhere we needed to go! 
13951605,305893811,2018-08-12,180657283,Anne-Sophie,"Nous avons rencontré John qui est très agréable. Très bon emplacement, de très bons restaurants dans les rues voisines. <br/>Appartement très propre, moderne !"
13951605,312329889,2018-08-23,22566730,Jamienne,The location is great and the place was nice and stylish. <br/>Our only complaint was that the water stopped working our last night into the next morning so we weren't able to take a shower...if that hadn't happened our stay would've been much more pleasant.
13951605,313808540,2018-08-26,56491541,Kira,Great little spot close to Syntagma and Ermou where you can walk down to Monistairki really easily. Plus very quiet and easy to find. The balcony was great to drink my coffee on in the morning too!
13951605,315925428,2018-08-30,15084343,David,"Really nice, compact apartment. In a great position, walking distance  to all of the main attractions. Area is very quite and with a nice balcony for relaxing in the morning or evening. "

13951605,319640450,2018-09-07,40637756,Megan,This is a fantastic place and location. Great restaurants just around the corner and close to all major sights. <br/>The space was very comfortable and had everything you need to feel at home. John was super accommodating helping us with the ferry strike and getting us in early to rest. He also helped arrange our early morning taxi ride to airport. <br/>Thank you John . You made our stay in Athens even better. Appreciate your quick replies too.
13951605,321317089,2018-09-10,27082026,Jonathan,"John’s place in Athens was perfect for us. We loved the style of the building and apartment. The location is unbeatable, being walking distance to the main sites and great food while also in a quiet, peaceful street."

13951605,325524789,2018-09-20,41017792,Marianne,Indeed a quite location in a beautiful secure building. Location couldn’t be better in great part of city. Balcony was a big bonus. John is a great communicator. The apartment was comfortable and spotless- would definitely recommend.
13951605,327675664,2018-09-24,28001355,Ellen,Perfecte studio op een ideale locatie in Athene. Alle highlights zijn op loopafstand. Heerlijke restaurants om de hoek (bijv. Nolan was erg goed!). John is een goede gastheer die snel reageert op je vragen. Alleen voor iets vollere/langere mensen zou het bed misschien wat klein kunnen zijn. Wij hebben heerlijk geslapen:)
13951605,329123810,2018-09-28,21317173,Fabienne,"Appartement très mignon, moderne avec tout le confort et les équipements (serviettes et accessoires de bain, machine Nespresso, super connexion wifi). Très belle terrasse. Extrêmement bien situé, calme mais proche de tout. Beaucoup de restaurants autour. John est très réactif, un super hôte."
13951605,331242767,2018-10-02,6141197,Nina,"Schönes Apartment! Sauber, hell, gut ausgestattet, großer Balkon. <br/>Super gelegen, mitten im Stadtteil Plaka. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten und die gesamte Innenstadt ist von dort fußläufig erreichbar. Auch die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel sind ganz in der Nähe. <br/>Super Restaurants für jeden Geschmack direkt neben dem Apartment. <br/>John war jederzeit gut erreichbar und hat schnell geantwortet. Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit. Sehr zu empfehlen!"
13951605,335132938,2018-10-11,18145498,Stephanie,"This place is definitely a gem in the city.  It is surrounded by a number of delicious restaurants and bars but is still able to nestle itself onto a fairly quiet street.  It does get quite dark in the evening and in the bldg but there are light switches in the hallway. The place inside is cute and quaint, with a large balcony and a clean bathroom.  If you’re in Athens and want to be close to the main attractions and food, this is the place to be!"
13951605,337034025,2018-10-15,36099148,James,"Superb choice for visiting Athens. The location is perfect - right amongst some of the best restaurants. Everywhere you would want to visit is within walking distance. The flat was extremely clean, and had everything we could want - the balcony is the stand-out feature. Thoroughly recommend."
13951605,338263022,2018-10-19,21178719,Alexander,"The apartment is in an excellent location. Many excellent restaurants down the streets (Try Nolan, Pink Flamingo and Avocado, all within a 100 metres). The apartment is ok, however, a bit smaller than expected. The bathroom was clean and modern. Only there was no wall attachment for the showerhead, so you had to hold the showerhead while showering."
13951605,341213239,2018-10-26,53664975,Chris,"Great location really close to many good restaurants/bars and walking distance to all the main sites. Apartment is perfect size for a couple with good kitchen and a large balcony. The neighborhood was central and felt very safe. The only downside was you had to turn the hot water on manually which took about 25 minutes, which meant grabbing a showing in the morning took a bit longer."
13951605,343001484,2018-10-30,44204976,Franziska,"We had a pleasant stay at Johns place. It's well located in the heart of Athens and leaves no wishes unfulfilled. Thank you very much, John!"
13951605,344297108,2018-11-03,129185045,John,Location location and lots of other benefits.  <br/>Charming and stylish apartment.  Lots of good eateries nearby and John is very happy to offer suggestions when asked (including giving you links in his responses that you can simply use to directly access maps and get directions).  Overall John’s communication and willingness to assist was exceptional.  The best we’ve had in two months of travelling with Airbnb accommodation.<br/>Apartment is clean and very comfortable.<br/>The balcony is a wonderful bonus of what is already a very good apartment.<br/>Totally recommend.
13951605,347293849,2018-11-11,94352160,Signe,"Perfekt sted i Athen! Boligen ligger midt i byen, og du får derfor en mere lokal oplevelse, hvor du opdager indkøbssteder, byliv og spisesteder på en mere lokal og nysgerrig måde. <br/><br/>Dejlig stor altan, hvor vi nød både morgenkaffen og aftensmaden!"

13951605,351835795,2018-11-24,10670103,Yifa,"Staying at John's place helped make our stay in Athens great due to the excellent location, ease of check-in and check-out, cooking facilities and John's responsiveness and flexibility. His recommendations were excellent and we were able to make the most of a very short trip and out of the area we were staying in (which really is great for foodies). The apartment was also very comfortable (also, we second what other reviewers have said about the shampoo being amazing). Thanks John!"

13951605,357373739,2018-12-10,22383548,Hande,"John was a really good and caring host, he gave me a lot of useful, personalized and inspiring suggestions. His house is located in a central location, arriving the house from the airport was also easy, considering the means of transport. After arriving, we walked everywhere from the house, didn't even need to use the metro at all. Even though it was in a very lively area, the street was really calm, quite and peaceful, we didn't hear any noise from outside. I would stay there again, %100 suggested!"

13951605,413229762,2019-02-17,26018726,Nicholas,"John’s apartment is right in the center of everything in Athens. With Syntagma station 2 mins from the door, you can get almost anywhere in the city fairly quickly. The space itself was everything I could have needed: a capable kitchen space, a comfortable clean bed with extra blankets, a small desk and an equiped washroom with great shower products. I highly recommend John’s place, he was a great host that provided intuitive information and responded very quickly to any requests I had."
13951605,419937474,2019-03-05,9578840,Nora,"Johns place is fitted out in a very nice style to feel comfortable and homely. the surprisingly big terrace invited us to hang around in the morning, catch the morning sun and having our coffee there. this light-flooded petite retreat is the best place to relax before and after a bustling Athens day."

There are plenty of nice restaurants and shops around - we especially liked the Ergon bakery and deli! The apartment is small but sufficient for 2 people with a well-stocked kitchen, and everything lovely and clean. The balcony is really nice, great to chill out with a bottle of wine after a days sightseeing! Good wifi throughout. Recommended."

John was an excellent host. He was responsive, helpful, and had great restaurant suggestions. The studio looks exactly like it does in the pictures and my husband and I felt safe walking around at night in the neighborhood. One thing that could have been better was if there was enough warm water and if there were black out shades. There’s a sheer shade that woke us up at about 5-6am every morning. But other than that we enjoyed our stay in Athens!"
13951605,452828637,2019-05-14,258395771,Sonia,"This studio is located in a great part of town, accessible to the metro, taxis and with a manageable walking distance to the Acropolis, among the many attractions nearby.

Near to Syndagma Place you can easily catch the Hop-on-Hop-off-Bus. We could even walk to Akropolis. It's a very friendly and quiet place, even though close to foody street. If I ever come  back to visit Athens I would definitely stay here again."

13951605,471775486,2019-06-18,16444792,Montana,Our stay at John’s apartment was incredible. It is conveniently located to all the best attractions/food/shopping (yet still quiet enough to sleep through the night or take a quick nap to get over jet lag mid day.) It was clean and comfortable. I stayed here with one of my girlfriends but could have easily fit three if we had needed too because of the extra day bed. John was very kind and communicative. Would definitely recommend!

Close to everything, the small apartment is just enough to sleep after a long day of being out and about. Don’t expect to have lots of room, there’s no inside table, but if you are just looking for an economically sensible place to lay your head, this is it. A small kitchen with mini fridge helps when you over indulge at the many many restaurants nearby. The host is really nice and responsive. Check the back of the door for info."

Great restaurants are just outside the apartment. The street is very quiet. Buses, taxis and Metro at Syntagma Square are within a three minute walk. Food stores are at 50 m. One can have breakfast at Antonio’s Cafe at 7 am at the southern end of the street. All the archeological sites are within walking distance.<br/>The apartment is well appointed and very comfortable. It has an amazing balcony where one can sit out comfortably.<br/>The apartment is strongly recommended for any one visiting Athens.<br/>Thank you John for an amazing stay."

He showed us the local spots on a map and advised us about great places to eat, drink, and shop in Athens. He was very helpful and welcoming. 
<br/>The apartment was clean, modern, well-decorated, and air-conditioned. The pictures on the profile exactly match what the apartment looks like. We loved the time we spent there. 
<br/>The only thing we did not know was that the neighborhood where the apartment lies is not the best -- although there were great places nearby, the streets surrounding the apartment were quite run-down. "

When we did finally leave to explore we realised we had chosen the perfect area to stay. All tourist areas are walking distance but you are insulated from the noise and lack of value for money the tourists areas have. Their are lots of little shops selling antiques and local artisans still work showing their true craft and skill. Lots of great places to eat nearby and bars that don't charge too much, it was a joy and the host was a wonder, who made sure we had everything,  knew where to go and what to do. We will be back l!"

Αλλά κυρίως δείχνει σεβασμό και ενδιαφέρον στους μελλοντικούς φιλοξενούμενους,  για άνετη και πολύ ευχάριστη διαμονή!<br/>Η θέση του στην καρδιά της Αθήνας, μας έδωσε την ευκαιρία να περπατήσουμε στους πολυσύχναστους δρόμους, να θαυμάσουμε τα παλιά έπιπλα στα μικρά μαγαζάκια και να παρατηρήσουμε παραδοσιακούς τεχνίτες, που όλο και εκλείπουν, την ώρα της δουλειάς τους. Οι μετακινήσεις μας πανεύκολες, δίπλα μας, ταξί, μετρό!  Δίπλα μας επίσης το Γκάζι, για βραδινές αλλά και απογευματινές εξορμήσεις, θέατρα, καφέ, η αρχαία αγορά, και τα παζάρια της Κυριακής, συνοδευόμενα από μουσικές του κόσμου!<br/>Ήταν πραγματικά μία ωραία ανάπαυλα για μας.<br/>Ευχαριστούμε την Airbnb και τον Σταμάτη για αυτό!<br/><br/>Γιάννης - Πόπη"

No need for public transport as everything is easily within walking distance.<br/>In the middle of winter the apartment was always warm, thanks to under floor heating and instant hot water.<br/>The apartment was very tastefully decorated,  and had plenty of storage space."
13955808,130199364,2017-02-05,110455542,Konstantinos,Fantastic place and area. Stamatis is a great host. I will come again soon. 10/10 :)))

13955808,135086904,2017-03-03,4396686,Yvonne,"We had a great stay at Stamatis's appartement. He was very kind and made sure that everything was fine. The bathroom was very small, my boyfriend of 1.98 meters couldn't fit so showering wasn't comfortable. If you like getting up early it is definitely a great place, sleeping in is not possible because of all the construction work in the area. The appartment is in the centre of Athens, everything can be done by foot. There are a lot of restaurants in the area, enough choices. Enjoy Athens!"
13955808,135452366,2017-03-05,53765219,Peter,"Everything was great! Stamatis is an incredible host--answered all of my questions before I arrived, sent me a message letting me know I should take a taxi bc the train operators were on strike, was waiting outside when I arrived, and was available throughout my trip to quickly answer any texts I sent him. The apartment is well equipped, has a nice patio, and the bed is quite comfortable. Neighborhood is perfect. Minutes from everything, but still quiet and calm. Perfect place. Can't wait to come back."
13955808,138220016,2017-03-19,48520773,Tonia,Πολύ καλή περιοχή. Τα πάντα δίπλα σου. Το σπίτι του Σταμάτη είναι πραγματικά πολύ ωραίο και με όλες τις ανέσεις. Ο Σταματης φιλόξενος και πολύ καλός απέναντι μας! Χίλια μπράβο! 
13955808,142451951,2017-04-08,115766165,Paul,"Joli appartement proche de l'Acropole. Un hôte très agréable qui a su nous présenter les activités et restaurants de son quartier! <br/><br/>Nous avons également apprécié sa réactivité sur (Hidden by Airbnb) , pour une communication (arrivé/départ) efficace."
13955808,143692266,2017-04-13,115766165,Paul,"Great place at a convenient location, in walking distance of Athens' main points of interest!<br/><br/>We received a warm welcome by Stamatis even though we arrived late in the evening. And we really appreciated his responsiveness in our communication through (Hidden by Airbnb) !<br/><br/>While being safe the neighbourhood is however very lively, we were surprised upon arrival but we got use to it quickly. (The Appartment being very quiet)"
13955808,146509374,2017-04-23,55953207,Lorena,Stamatis was an awesome host. Extremely helpful and friendly. Very knowledgable of Athens and the apartments surroundings. Apartment was very clean and has everything needed for a comfortable stay. Would definitely return.  
13955808,149563900,2017-05-05,13289211,Imran,"Stamatis was the perfect host. He was extremely helpful and attentive. He provided my fiancé and I with a detailed guide of Greece and our surroundings with absolutely everything we needed for our stay. He included a map and great suggestions on where to eat. He checked up on us very often to see if we needed assistance. I could not ask for a better host.<br/>His place was very clean, safe, and secure. The location was very convenient and was within walking distance of all the essentials. I wish we could've stayed longer!"
13955808,150183072,2017-05-07,128694382,Dimitris,"Great value/price factor. Stamatis is an excellent host. precise, gentle and responds immediately. The place is fantastic, nicely decorated, full amenities,a small con is that you need to be a bit careful with parking if you travel by car (no personal experience just an observation), but not a game changer. Just a minute from the heart of Athens' most joyful area (the best places to eat have a coffe drink or just wander), without the respective noise pollution !!! Strongly suggest."
13955808,150453543,2017-05-08,102789782,Prudence,"Stamatis met us around the corner from the apartment to make sure we found the right place. He was so helpful and accomodating once we got there. Beautiful apartment, the location is perfect. Thank you Stamatis!"
13955808,156526107,2017-05-31,2279780,Reni,"Ein besonders schönes geschmackvolles Apartment und Stamatis ist ein perfekter Gastgeber. Als z.B. die Kaffeemaschine kaputt war, stand in wenigen Stunden eine neue da, großartig. Das Apartment ist wunderschön ausgestattet, es hat nichts gefehlt, es war nichts kaputt, eine Seltenheit in Athen. Die große Terrasse habe ich am Morgen und am Abend sehr genossen und auch das gute härtere Bett.<br/>Man sollte einigermaßen gut zu Fuß sein, das Apartment liegt im 2. Stock, es gibt nur 2 Apartments im Haus.<br/>Die Umgebung ist mitten in Psirri, in einer ruhigeren Seitenstraße....griechisch, zum Teil ziemlich schäbig, aber nach ein paar Tagen sieht man das nicht mehr. Es hat hier auch an jeder Ecke viele interessante Graffitis, in 2 Minuten zu Fuß viele tolle Lokale und Tavernen, eine großartige Bäckerei und nur ein paar Minuten zur Ubahn Thissio oder Monastiraki. Besser kann man nicht wohnen.<br/>Ich komme im Herbst wieder.<br/>"
13955808,159956779,2017-06-12,103017076,Jennifer,"Stamatis was an amazing host, from the communications before my arrival and during he was the most helpful. Stamatis provided me with many suggestions of where to go, favorite places away from touristic places, and east routes to walk all over Athens. Without his help I would have been lost. The apartment was very spacious and beautiful. The balancing was perfect for morning coffee to relax before an event packed day. Even the sunset tour to the Cape came to pick me up at this apartment. It was an amazing experience and I would stay here again!"
13955808,160981924,2017-06-16,133729754,Giuseppe,"Appartamento pienamente conforme alla descrizione. Stamatis e' stato molto gentile e disponibile, fornendoci tutte le informazioni di cui avevamo bisogno. Ottimo soggiorno"
13955808,169387129,2017-07-12,18348993,Chanel,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I was so nervous and hesitant it wouldn't be what I expected. Wow did it exceed all of my expectations! The 2 story apartment was absolutely gorgeous, clean (a huge deal for me) and perfectly located 10 minutes walking distance from everything! Stamatis made the whole experience easier by providing us a map and a whole guide of the best places to see, shop, eat, and drink from a locals standpoint. All of his suggestions were perfect and gave us the best experience out of our trip!! He was so quick and responsive to all my questions throughout my travels leading up to my arrival (my flight was delayed and we didn't come in until very late) and he made himself available which eased a lot of stress for us.  I'll definitely be recommending his place to friends who want to visit. "
13955808,169950925,2017-07-14,56856275,Victor,"Beautiful apartment! It had everything you could possibly need and very clean! Its location is perfect and close to everything whether you want shopping, sightseeing or night life! "
13955808,172937873,2017-07-22,124957284,Isabella,"Amazing stay! Really nice communication and tips from Stamatis. The apartment is truly like the pictures - great atmosphere and location, the only thing we could propose is a memory top madness for the bed to make it softer."
13955808,179656895,2017-08-08,8091836,Tomasz,"Very nice place! Bathrooms were nice and floors were clean and the place looked updated. Stamatis is a really nice guy who was very attentive to getting us into the place and answered his phone immediately. Very responsive! A great host.  The area right around the apartment didn't seem the best, but I think its more of a reflection of Athens and the poor economic situation in the country. It was however close to everything you would want to see."

The loft apartment was very beautiful, updated and clean situated waking distance to all touristy attraction but also great restaurants and nightlife scene. Stamatis has offered earlier check in due to my morning flight's arrival to Athens and provided great tips and information about the local dining and sightseeing places. Very attentive and informative throughout my short stay. "

13955808,191597883,2017-09-08,141776049,Melissa,"Stamatis's place was very much as the photos describes although there was much construction right in front and the whole building is under renovation. Also, should note that there are 3 flights of stairs to go up to get to the apartment for anyone with reduced mobility. Short walk away  (10-15min) to Ermou street and many of the main attractions (resto, flee market and metro station). We really enjoyed our short stay. P.S Beautiful artwork throughout the apt."
13955808,192739705,2017-09-11,69895207,Imogen,"Awesome stay at this apartment - very spacious, great location and heaps of character. Stamatis was a great host. Was awesome to get some washing done too!! Highly recommend."
13955808,195045695,2017-09-18,43610909,Lise,"Stamatis' place was exactly as represented in the photos.  It is a lovely, arty, quiet little hide-away in central Athens.  Everything is walkable, including a cool little pedestrian street full of cafes, restaurants and bars, the big historic sights/museums and the shopping district.  Stamatis is a great host: he arranged for our early check-in, sat down with us to discuss things to do and see, gave the best recommendations for food, coffee, nightlife and was always available.  We loved being able to recover in the air conditioning after a day walking in the hot sun and being able to enjoy a glass of wine on the huge balcony while the city of Athens buzzed around us.  It was also very handy to have a washing machine since we had just come directly to Athens from a sailing adventure around the Greek Islands.  I would highly recommend this spot not only for its comforts and quiet, but also for its centrality to so many little downtown neighbourhoods that are easily walkable from the apartment. It was also a little removed from the very touristy Plaka which gave it a more neighbourhood feel."
13955808,195597460,2017-09-20,8130812,Jessica,Stamatis was super helpful with a list of things to do and see. Met us early for check in. His place was really nice as well. We enjoyed our stay!

13955808,198631470,2017-09-30,35240528,Kyle,This flat is in an awesome location and has an eclectic vibe to it. You can walk all around the city since this location is so central to everything. The neighborhood had some amazing cafes and bakeries that we frequented multiple times. Stamatis let us check in early since our flight got in well before the normal check-in time. He even offered to let us keep our bags at the flat after checkout since we had a later flight out. He gave us a quick layout of the area with suggestions on places to go. There was even a pocket guide to Athens that we used the entire time. Just an FYI - if you've over 6'2 then your head will touch the ceiling when you shower. We loved our stay and would definitely recommend it to anyone.
13955808,199094350,2017-10-01,9767219,Alex,Great location.

All the popular scenic spots, including Acropolis, are within walking distance- 30 minutes maximum. The home itself is well furnished and pretty. Highly recommend!"
13955808,207045271,2017-10-28,3209668,Julia,Very nice apartment in a really central neighbourhood! Everything was really uncomplicated and we would definitely recommend staying at Stamatis place!
13955808,222971703,2017-12-31,689038,Mindy,The location was good. We could walk to the main attraction spots in Athens. It’s in a quiet lane way so very quiet at night. The apartment is in an historical building and has no elevator.<br/>We parked our car on the street (free parking) in the neighborhood and the window was smashed overnight. We suggest to pay and park the car indoor so it’s safer.

There is nice coffee machine, all amenities necessary including hair drier. He gave us a lot of local tips, even helped me to get a great physiotherapist for my back pain. The location is in very nice area, quiet, yet so close to bars, restaurants and lovely streets for night walk as well as close to all important historic sites. We spent most of the times walking everywhere as it is in walking distance. Check in and check out were very flexible and prompt as well as the communication with Stamatis. Highly recommended! :)"
13955808,243211396,2018-03-15,167811952,Marissa,This was a very beautiful space and Stamatis was very helpful throughout our stay. He always replied quickly to messages and allowed us to check in early because of our flight. He gave us several great tips about the area and what sights to see.

13955808,246791735,2018-03-26,63412748,Kevin,"Superbe appartement mêlant modernité et design avec une touche de classicisme grec. L'appartement est plutôt bien situé, proche de la place Monastiraki (7min à pied) et de deux stations de métro. Il y a des habitations un peu plus proches, mais difficilement avec cette qualité d'appartementbet d'équipement. Concernant Stamatis, réactivité du tonnerre, sympathique au possible, parlant très bien l'anglais et très attentionné (carte avec toutes les choses à faire, conseils spécifiques, bouteille de vin,...). Très arrangeant et communicatif. Cela justifie le tarif, un peu plus élevé que la moyenne à Athènes. Je recommande sans aucune hésitation !!"

The apartment is very stylish — great decor and layout (designed by Stamatis himself). The location is excellent— only 5 min walk to Monastariki and maybe 12 min to Plaka. There is a 107 year old bakery about 3 min walk away as well for breakfast. The place is very clean and the bed comfortable. AC works perfectly. Would definitely recommend this great spot!"
13955808,280882867,2018-06-24,14183408,Shine,Very beautiful house.  And Stamatic is very nice. Everything l want l can get in the house.  I like this house very much

13955808,282715380,2018-06-28,147869274,Jane,"Stamatis is a very nice guy. He was always quick to communicate with us and very polite. He remembered details about our trip and when I forgot to inform him about a change in our plans, he was very nice about it. He was even nice enough to meet us at the home at 2 AM to check us in after a late flight, which we really appreciated. <br/><br/>After he left, however, we were disappointed. This place was not clean. There was dust everywhere. It smelled like cigarettes. The towels did not smell fresh. The upstairs bathroom smelled like sewage. The smell appeared to be coming from a drain on the floor. The cups did not smell clean.<br/><br/>On the second night of our stay, the WiFi was not working, so we couldn’t use our phones until we left and arrived at the airport. We stayed at another Airbnb in Athens prior to this one. It was in the same price range and nearby and everything was perfect, so I know that we could have gotten a better value for our money.<br/><br/> "
13955808,293287033,2018-07-20,78650251,Oscar,"Dead on description of the place. Wonderfully situated, stylish two-floor apartment with a balcony, and great communication with staff. The place is situated on a small, narrow road so if you’re driving not this. Other than that, WiFi Service was decent and checkout was a breeze too."
13955808,311814783,2018-08-22,91026684,David,"This apartment is just about as perfect as one could want. It has a wonderful floor plan, and all great amenities. It’s modern and stylish, yet retains an old-world charm and feel. The host was absolutely the best! He was not only very accommodating, but also very helpful and informative. The prepared information packet was exactly what we needed on our first trip to Athens. It could not have been a better experience!"

13955808,316892388,2018-09-01,70587299,Gwendolyn,"We stayed at multiple air bnb's in Athens, and this one blew the others out of the water. Stamatis' place is located close to Psiri area, and also the train station in case you want to explore other areas. The space itself has everything you could possibly need and is stylishly decorated. The building is new, clean, and easy to get in and out of with elevator access. The only tip would be to run the AC when you get there, as the loft bedroom takes a while to cool down. However, we didn't mind this, as he also provides a fan. 10/10 experience, we highly recommend staying here!"
13955808,319076818,2018-09-05,13251297,Maria Jesus,Stamatis’s place has been meticulously prepared for the traveller. It is a beautiful place to relax in this beautiful city.
13955808,321714943,2018-09-11,8428310,David,Pictures in my opinion do not do this place justice. It's a delightful apartment with the right kind of interior decorations and modern touches. <br/>Location wise - it's excellent - easily walking distance from all of the main attractions. The host was communicative and friendly - all very positive and it made our stay very enjoyable. Please book without hesitation. Keep well!

We arrived in Athens very early in the morning and the apartment happened to be ready.  Stamatis  was kind enough to meet us way ahead of check in time and he went over the apartment, neighborhood and many other details helpful for our stay. <br/><br/>The apartment is a beautifully  renovated space with many great details and touches.  An upstairs bedroom loft had a comfortable double bed, plenty of closet and storage space, iron, a full bathing more.  Very comfortable living area & dining space and a large well equipped  kitchen with coffee maker and more.  Everything was very clean and comfortable and we especially enjoyed the huge balcony perfect for morning coffee and afternoon drinks. <br/><br/>If you're looking at this apartment you may already know a bit about the neighborhood.  Psiri is a very eclectic, up and coming neighborhood in Athens with many great artisan shops, restaurants, bakeries and bars.  It's a great location that's in easy walking distance to Plaka, the Acropolis, Monostiraki, museums and much more.  It has a very energetic vibe especially at night, but your first visit to this neighborhood may catch you by surprise.  This apartment is basically a beautiful oasis surrounded by many graffiti covered abandoned buildings.  Actually much of Psiri is basically graffiti covered abandoned buildings and may look run down but don't let that fool you, it's really a cool area.   I've stayed in this neighborhood many times and walk all around it even late at night with my wife and have never felt uneasy or uncomfortable. This apartment is an easy walk to lots of great restaurants, shops and many of Athen's best attractions.<br/><br/>We very much enjoyed our stay in this apartment and our interaction with Stamatis and would love to stay here again on our next visit, highly recommended !"
13955808,339238159,2018-10-21,10035822,Vivian,Great location - walkable distance to everything you need including the metro (super easy to come from the airport to the house). Stamatis was amazing providing all the information needed prior arrival and during the stay - including a comprehensive list of places to visit.

13955808,478044778,2019-06-29,58097811,Joel,Stamatis’ place was immaculate and has some great unique touches they seperate it from your cookie cutter city apartment. The location is superb and you are able to walk to all the sights and explore the different areas of Athens too.  There are some amazing restaurants and cafes around the area and Stamatis was very helpful in offering his knowledge about the city and was very prompt in any communication with me :) Would gladly stay here again when I return to Athens.

13955808,525615240,2019-09-08,119713234,Yang,A great flat in a very convenient location to the Plaka and all of the major attractions in Athens.  Be sure to explore the street and flea markets in the area. The flat is in great shape and provides comfortable accommodations as a home away from home while visiting Athens. Stamatis is a great host and was welcoming and informative in helping to plan our time in the city. He provided a great map and took us through a number of the cultural and historic sites as well as suggesting a few off the beaten path. His recommendation to take a bus to see the Temple of Poseidon was a great idea that we took advantage of and had a wonderful experience.
13955808,532613988,2019-09-20,138534560,Jonathan,"Stamatis welcomed me warmly and offered a comprehensive summary of the local area, things to do, and places to enjoy good Greek food.<br/><br/>The apartment was lovely. Plenty of space for my friend and I. It is in a great location only a few minutes walk from Monastiraki and Plaka.<br/><br/>When we next go back to central Athens I'll definitely check to see if Stamatis' apartment is available."

13955808,571536212,2019-12-01,68899085,Albertina,This apartment is amazing. There is a small one person elevator that makes getting your luggage up and down daily. The communication is fast and accurate. If there are issues he is there to solve them as quickly as possible. Honestly I would recommend him to any and everyone!!! The location is great! If you like being in the local area this is as local as you can get with being in walking distance to tourist areas as well! 10 out of 10 for me!
13955808,587545768,2020-01-03,97064881,Krishen,"Stamatis was great with us, even our flight was late at night, he took the time to welcome us, and advised us what to visit and how in Athens.<br/>The flat was clean and well designed, nice location to visit everything by walk.<br/>Thank you !"

The location is perfect with lots of lovely restaurants and bars close by and you can easily walk to other central locations in the city.  Stamatis, as a host, was amazing!! He organized my pick up from the airport and upon arrival made the time to provide local tips and also recommended tourists sites in and around Athens.  I would happily stay at Stamatis' when I return to Athens. If you are looking for a great apartment, with great ambiance and style and centrally located. Look no further!"

13955808,660126333,2020-09-04,10525119,Renaud,Appartement sympa au centre d’Athènes dans le quartier des potiers. Tout est accessible à pied ou à métro. Un couchage en mezzanine sous les toits (heureusement il y a la clim !). Un couchage simple d’appoint dans le salon. La terrasse plein sud était trop chaude pour en profiter mais en intersaison elle doit être très agréable. L’équipement est complet. Un très bon séjour que je recommande.

The place itself is in a beautifully renovated neoclassical building. The apartment has beautiful and artistic details, a lot of thought has been put into it. It was a pleasure and incredibly easy to communicate with Stamatis, he even saved us a parking space upon arrival. And he offered us a lot of tips of where to eat etc. Definitely worth staying here!"

The place is in the heart of la plaka and therefore in the center of Athens. In less than 5 minutes walk you will be at the main squares of Athens downtown. The house common spaces were very clean and the room too. It was a beautiful experience to be hosted by them in my staying in Athens. I will absolutely suggest for vacation purpose but if you need to stay in a very quiet room, you may consider another room than the ""Red Room"". "

Consigliatissimo!!"
13972503,103200061,2016-09-21,46953616,Paweł,"Lilly provided all info and listing is very nice, but we wanted to sleep before our early fly. Unfortunately the host tourned on loud music in the corridor and after our remark they just closed the door, but the music was still loud (because there was no ceiling in our Red Room, but just the roof, therefore the light from other rooms and mosquitoes disturbed sleep). "
13972503,104282149,2016-09-25,44815250,Mary,Lilly was very friendly and communicated well.  The location just can't be beaten - right in the heart of Athens within walking distance of everything you'd want to see.  The house is very beautiful.

13972503,105813706,2016-10-03,3710391,Teona,I enjoyed staying in a comfortable and unusual place - seemed to be lots of people coming and going and for some guests it might be too noisy (traffic in the street).  This is not really a place for breakfast - minimal kitchen - but lots of places to eat very close.
13972503,106973443,2016-10-09,15308519,David,Lilly was a very friendly host. The house is very nice and in the middle from Athens. Everything you need is nearby. The room was very clean and looked great. We had a perfect stay at Lilly´s place.
13972503,107876105,2016-10-13,86771097,Jesus,"La habitación es como se visualiza en las fotos. la cama es grande y cómoda. no hay bulla en las noches por lo que se puede descansar cómodamente. Nos recibió Giannis quien es muy dulce y amable. A pesar de lo tarde de nuestra llegada nos mostró el lugar y siempre se mostró dispuesta a apoyarnos. El lugar es de fácil acceso, las instrucciones de llegada que nos dieron fueron precisas y hubo muy buena comunicación antes y duranre nuestra estadía. Definitivamente recomiendo este lugar!"
13972503,108013584,2016-10-14,46372267,Eduardo,Lilly really put an effort to make us feel comfortable. We had a very pleasant stay at the apartment. Surely recommend her as a guest.

13972503,108907091,2016-10-18,70526356,Yannis,I had a really fantastic experience staying at this beautiful historical house. From the very beginning Lilly was very helpful with the communication and the welcome. I had also a wise even short discussion with Mimis the philosopher. And I was amazed by the restoration work of Yannis in the house. I will be back soon guys!
13972503,109334917,2016-10-21,88553259,Lucy,"I had a good time staying in the place. Very nice people, convenient location, clean room. The only disadvantage is that dog barking (from the street) is loud and happens late night. "
13972503,109393126,2016-10-21,65374375,Florian,"Lilly was very welcoming and flexible in spite of our late arrival ! She does everything to make your stay enjoyable. She gives many pieces of advice about places around the house, it was a very good welcome"

13972503,110541039,2016-10-27,48596682,Josefine,"Lilly war eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Das Haus ist toll und das Zimmer war riesig. Ebenso das Bett, es schlief sich super. Die Wohnung ist sehr zentral gelegen und man erreicht die wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß. Allerdings war es im Zimmer etwas laut, da auf dem Hinterhof ein Generator lief und durch die Umbauarbeiten im Haus war es manchmal etwas hellhörig. Wen sowas aber nicht stört, sollte dort auf jeden Fall nächtigen! :)"

13972503,112962503,2016-11-09,97317866,Carmen,"Fantastic experience! Giannis, Mimis and Lilly are amazing guests, very welcoming, authentic people. We had a very nice time with Giannis and Mimis speaking about greek culture, philosophy, poetry..Lilly was brilliant, she gave us some recommendations on where to go to find good music and interesting clubs and it was just perfect.  
<br/>The house is wonderful, the rooms and bathrooms very clean, there is also a terrace, where we had a very nice breakfast enjoying the sun. Perfect location in the heart of Athens, the best choice to visit all around the historical center.
<br/> I really recommend this place! They made us feel like home. Thank you so much!!!I hope we see us again!"

"
13972503,114542221,2016-11-19,67570150,Giulia,"I felt very lucky to have chosen this place. Location, cleanliness, etc. all 5 stars, plus Lilly is wonderful! She is very sweet, ever smiling and gave us precious tips, which I think made the difference in our stay. Even my friends who weren't staying there had a greater experience in Athens because we all followed her tips, and they also say: thank you Lilly!
<br/>I enjoyed being around the other, less talkative but not less kind, tenants: Mimis, Giannis and Betty (the cat). Thank you all for making us feel so welcome.
<br/>It's true it's not the most quiet area. Depends where you come from really, it wasn't that loud either. I'm a light sleeper and I did have some troubles with it, but nothing compared to the convenience of the location and the experience I gained from staying there. The house is really beautiful too, as other reviews state, even more than you can see from the pictures. And it’s filled with a genuine friendliness. 
<br/>The neighbourhood is very close to a lot of cool places to eat or have a drink. Ours was a last minute trip, so we had not prepared at all. And yet we had a great time. Thanks to Lilly and Romvis 16.
<br/>If you're vegetarian/vegan and not into walking miles for food, it's good to know that there is a falafel place right there! I didn't have any problems at all finding food. Everything was very good, a fantastic stay. :)"

13972503,115853092,2016-11-27,55931336,Persephoné,"Great stay! We loved the old feel of the house and the room was nicer than mine at home. Bed was comfy, everything was clean, extra blankets and towels provided. The hosts were there when we needed them and very friendly, but we had our own space to explore and relax; felt more like staying with friends than strangers. The recommendations of places to go really helped us explore Athens! Some unknown places we wouldn't have found otherwise. No wardrobe, but the room was gorgeous and huge so it didn't matter! Would recommend and would stay again!"

There is buses from airport  every 20 minutes all night. Giannis was a very wellcoming guy. Everything is the same that they writed in airbnb notice.thank you guys"
13972503,126901483,2017-01-15,97926309,Octavio Nicolas,Go there. Have fun. You will enjoy it for sure.
13972503,128365527,2017-01-24,69765916,Marwa,"The room is warm and clean,it's fabulous. Its location is perfect it's less than 5 min walking from both syntagma and monastiraki squares (it's in the middle) which are considered the center of athens. It's also so close to Ermou street where you can find most of the shops and restaurants. The neighborhood is good and safe so you can get back late without worrying unlike other near by places. They guys are fantastic, friendly and very helpful they'll give you the tips you'll need. the bathroom is great and clean. the kitchen is basic but you'll find everything you might need. They also have another airbnb room so it's likely that you'll meet other fellows from different places which is fantastic. I loved everything about the place..you'll never regret it!"
13972503,128880292,2017-01-28,36296823,Nataly,The place is good for a short travel. It's very good located and the room is very confortable.

Faltan espacios comunes para estar y solo hay un baño en cada planta.<br/>100% Recomendable. Relación calidad-precio correcta."
13972503,134795586,2017-03-01,88436789,M,"Het huis was makkelijk bereikbaar,en zeer centraal gelegen. We werden hartelijk ontvangen door Giannis. We hebben gedurende ons verblijf niet veel contact meer gehad, maar hij was telkens goed bereikbaar voor vragen. Het huis is erg karakteristiek. Het is grotendeels opgeknapt, maar het stoort in het geheel niet dat er hier en daar nog werkzaamheden bezig zijn. Het huis is schoon en mooi ingericht, het bed comfortabel."
13972503,136320588,2017-03-10,27615665,Justin,"I stayed here for 10 days and all I can say is this place exceeded my expectations.  It was PERFECT. Beautiful house, and Giannis and Mimi's made me feel very welcome.  Unfortunately I did not get to meet Lilly as she was away.  The house itself was very cosy, full of character, and very welcoming.  The red room was very spacious.  And the location was absolutely perfect, I ended up just walking everywhere as it was so central, I did not have to get public transport once.  <br/>It was sad to leave as I felt I became a part of the family."
13972503,136692381,2017-03-12,13979510,Ievgenii,It was a great stay. Very cosy and well located apartment with a terrace on the roof. The house itself breathes with history but all needed amenities are present and the room was very comfortable. Good atmosphere and welcoming hosts. Recommend

I would have never had thought that, even though the house is in the main shopping district, the place and the night was silent.

Ci hanno accolto al meglio che potessero, è molto facile arrivarci perchè è a due passi da Syntagma e da Monasiraki, hanno aspettato addirittura che arrivassimo di notte! La palazzina è una sorta di casa comune, pulitissima e con molte stanze e bagni. La nostra stanza era perfetta con il condizionatore ed un gusto per l'estetica non indifferente. Quello che sorprende è che seppure ci sono molte persone nel posto hai la possibilità di stare isolato e nello stesso tempo la possibilità di stare insieme agli altri."

13972503,164978385,2017-06-29,96287,Geneviève,"Quel bonheur de vivre la vie de bohème à Athènes.  Il s'agit d'un grand ""flat-share"" qui occupe tout un immeuble 18ème génialement placé dans un quartier animé, et où on croise dans la cuisine des personnages pittoresques, de passage ou pas. Lilly est l'hôtesse, pétillante, fantaisiste et chaleureuse, Giannis est le génie du logis, doux et discret. Je n'ai pas rencontré Mimis, qui ""lit des livres et fait des miracles"" (pour les miracles, c'est vrai, je suis témoin). Ma chambre était spacieuse, très haute de plafond, confortable et stylée, avec son vieux piano et son ventilateur qui m'a aidée à supporter la chaleur. Personnellement, c'est vraiment ce que je recherche sur Airbnb..."
13972503,168182403,2017-07-09,107674015,Carina,The place is perfectly located in the center of Athens. The hosts are very helpful. We felt at home. They helped in everything we needed. The apartment is very clean and tidy. It's a cheerful place. We totally recommend and we will go back!

Un petit air ""d'auberge espagnole"" très agréable... <br/>La maison est en plein centre, nous avons pu faire toute la ville à pied sans jamais prendre le métro. Quartier assez animé pour rentrer en sécurité le soir et la nuit mais chambre ne donnant pas sur la rue, donc plutôt paisible pour son emplacement.<br/>Des colocataires qui vous accueillent avec le sourire et décontraction. Toujours prêt à rendre service. On se sent vraiment à l'aise!<br/>Seul bémol: malgré des chambres nickels, une salle de bain sale dû à tous les passages des nombreux ""invités"", mais cela varie probablement en fonction des personnes qui partagent avec nous le lieu pendant le séjour...<br/>Malgré tout, un lieu dans lequel on reviendrait sans hésitation!"

Yannis fue muy amable con nosotros. Tengo que decir algo negativo y es que no funcionaba el aire acondicionado, así que estuvimos con ventilador. En los días que estuvimos hacia 38 grados y supongo que por la forma de la casa de madera y ubicación cuando llegábamos a la noche era imposible dormir. El aire super caliente y incluso de la cama emanaba calor y no parabas de sudar, así que no pudimos dormir nada. La segunda noche buscamos otro hotel porque era imposible dormir. Volvería a ir sin duda en otra época de menos calor o siempre preguntando si tienen aire acondicionado y les funciona porque el lugar, la casa y el anfitrión fueron del todo agradables."

De todas maneras, cuenta con un ventilador de piso. El baño compartido siempre estuvo muy limpio. El recibimiento fue muy bueno, aunque un poco difícil la comunicación antes y durante la estadía. La ubicación es perfecta!! Excelente relación calidad - precio. Muchas gracias por todo!!"
13972503,187562953,2017-08-27,40872285,Julia,"We had great experience at this place. Very nice host, clean apartment, great location, quiet room.

Theres a lot of restaurants, places to do shopping plus you can walk to the main places (parthenon, acropolis, etc). Lilly also gave us a list with very local places to breakfast, lunch and places to go.<br/>The only thing i will point is that the air conditioner that you see on the photos is not in the room anymore, there is a fan, which in august sometimes is not enough.<br/><br/>Thanks for everything!"
13972503,190330897,2017-09-04,1857183,Giuseppe,Ci siamo trovati benissimo. Abbiamo avuto un'ottima accoglienza e la casa ha tutto ciò che serve. Vicina al Centro e ai mezzi pubblici. Grazie Alis and Lilly.  Si consiglia.

Et surtout pour visiter il est parfaitement placé ! Et malgrés son emplacement central et dans un quartier sympa et sécurisant le bruit n'était pas là ! Merci pour le parfait  accueil, on se sent comme à la maison. Je recommande sans hésiter vue le rapport qualité prix "

13972503,196369474,2017-09-23,89478985,Jacqui,This accomodation is within walking distance to all the major attractions & restaurants. The public bus x95 is easily accessible to & from the airport & hosts are extremely friendly & welcoming. Our bedroom & shared bathroom was clean -  excellent value for money.
13972503,197589503,2017-09-26,127947761,Bo,"Good location, nice host. Appreciate for warm hospitality! We really enjoy the moment."
13972503,199510317,2017-10-02,21006784,Christiane,"The flat is really close to all main touristic attractions. Apart of that, we were quite disappointed... It was very loud, not because of the cafés or people on the street, but because of the other rooms in the Airbnb and most of all because of a reactor in the courtyard. The room was very dark and bad air because of the reactor. The bed was really uncomfortable and squirted with every small movement we did. In the whole flat it didn't smell good. During our stay the cat peed once on the sofa in the kitchen and once on the mat in the bathroom, which was really ugly."
13972503,200624635,2017-10-06,8227086,Elisabetta,"posizione strategica, zona con molti locali bar ristoranti ( non turistici ) la titolare molto simpatica e premurosa, stanze e atmosfera bohemien arredato con grande gusto, soffitti altissimi lo consiglio alla grande!"
13972503,202437014,2017-10-11,145211317,Leo,"I spent two nights here and the Red Room is exactly as advertised; in a great space (an old house) and a wonderful location, in the heart of everything and just a 10+ minute walk to the Acropolis.  The room is simple, almost Spartan, but the bed/mattress is very comfortable.  Everything is sparkling clean and Alisa is a joyful, friendly and hospitable host (regrettably I didn't meet Mimi & Yannis).  The room has high ceilings (around 20 ft) and the window opens into a central area (no air-conditioning so possibly a bit hot in mid-summer but perfect in October with plenty of fresh breeze).  The room is also remarkably quiet for the area since it doesn't open onto the street.  Good restaurants and cafeneions are just outside the front door.  I recommend this highly and will definitely stay here again when I come through Athens again in about a month."
13972503,202637542,2017-10-12,123923035,Ray,It’s the location..
13972503,202871923,2017-10-13,86403543,Kirk,"We talked with Alisa who was very friendly. The place has a lot of character. Unfortunately we only stayed 1 night, arrived late and left early for our flight. But we found her place to be very central yet in an area that seemed to surrounded by lively locals rather than the typical tourist areas. Wish we could have stayed longer."
13972503,203103968,2017-10-14,149582337,Gifty,"This place was an absolutely amazing location, just 7-20 minutes from the cities historical cites and even closer to several restaurants and shops. Check in was smooth and check out was flexible since we had such an early flight. Overall great experience."

It's easy to get from the airport, it's as central as it could get and it's surrounded by everything we could possibly need. We went by walk everywhere but the airport. As it is in the center sometimes there's noise but it says that on the description, and last, but no less important, Alisa is great! Thank you!"

The place itself is super central and of walkable distances to everything - acropolis, ancient agora, syntagma etc. The rooftop terrace is also great, if you’re into yoga or working out :)<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this place and will come back next time :)"

I love architecture, and the house itself is really interesting. They put an information booklet in the room with lots of helpful hints for all kinds of things to do and eat, and included earplugs by the bed in case of street noise (but we never had to use them). Yiannis was so nice and enjoyable to talk to—I’m sorry I didn’t get to meet the rest. Thank you, Yiannis, Alis, Mimi, and Betty for a wonderful stay!"

13972503,286811876,2018-07-07,21245691,Amanda,We had an amazing time staying here. The location is very central meaning that we did not need to take the metro to see the sites.

13972503,290746656,2018-07-15,45732377,Denise,"Alisa, Yannis, and Mimi’s place was great because it’s located close to a majority of the attraction sites (ie Acropolis) and eateries. I mainly interacted with Yannis and he was very welcoming and accommodating. He was always available in case you needed help or just simply wanted to ask for some local tips on getting around the city.

Unfortunately it was very hot at night, but we knew before that there is no AC.  We met Alisa at her cafe where we had great breakfast for a very good price. Alisa is a welcoming, friendly and happy person. We recommend the place and would come again! "

The building is in the very heart of Athens and at a walk distance from the major attractions (like the Acropolis and the Agora) and from nice bars and restaurants. We met Alis and Yannis, who were both very kind and helpful giving us both advices and a nice insight of the city. The room was clean and it had a fan (very importanti in August). The house has a magical vintage vibe but the facilities (like the bathroom) are new and functional. Thank you and see you soon "

Hospitality was above and beyond, providing additional blankets when mentioning that the room was cold and providing an extensive booklet of local tips.<br/>The house itself is another one of Athens' ancient mysteries. It just appears to get bigger and bigger; the more time you spend there the more doors you seem to find.<br/>The location is also great. Right in the heart of the Athens, nestled between two metro stations, which you may not even need to use as it is just so easy to walk everywhere.<br/>I recommend everything about this place!"

13972503,368514013,2019-01-07,158941847,Giovanni,"Posizione lodevole, a dir poco perfetta per spostarsi in città: essendo in centro in mezzo minuto si raggiunge la via centrale che taglia in 2 la città e in pochi minuti si raggiungono le piazze Syntagma e Monastiraki. Si può quindi uscire senza problemi a qualunque ora del giorno e della notte. La stanza era molto spaziosa e confortevole, soffitto molto alto: nonostante ciò era molto ben riscaldata (noi siamo freddolosi). Dalla finestra non si ha il panorama, ma a noi non interessa. Qualità /prezzo TOP!!! Straconsigliamo, almeno per il periodo invernale."

En été, le manque de climatisation (même s'il y avait 2 ventilateurs qui fonctionnaient en permanence) peut s'opposer à un bon sommeil.

Many bars and restaurants around, perfect to begin or finishing a trip very close to home.<br/>10 minutes walking to the Acropole. We went there very soon in the morning (by 7am), it was a great opportunity to discover also the quietness of the city. <br/>Alissa made us feel at home, answering very fast and offering the whole building (kitchen, fridge, 3 bathrooms...). <br/>The bedroom included 2 wind-makers, a so good idea even at night !!"

13972503,511180135,2019-08-17,26876025,Theresa,Good location in Athens. We are from the states (NYC) so the only negative to this Airbnb was the lack of air conditioning. In the heat of August it was quite unbearable. It is a great place to find affordable housing and make friends otherwise.
13972503,513119625,2019-08-19,63096860,Margherita,"The location of the apartment was perfect, very quiet, clean and the host very welcoming. We really loved the roof terrace, best spot to rest and feel at home in Athens. The house was very charming and well kept. The only thing I would change is to tell the guests hat in the read room there is not air conditioning and not so much natural light."

The host is very kind and helpful, she let us leave late (at 7pm) with no extra charge. Just taking into account if you visit Athens in summer that the place without AC and it's very hot at the rooms, except this very reccomend and value for money."

The room has no AC and window screens, so do not open the window if you do not want to get bitten by mosquitoes. Fans were provided, but won't help too much to lower the room temperature."

13972503,607565501,2020-02-18,1482410,Florence,"Alisa was very reactive to my last minute request and helpful to plan my next move during a transport strike in Athens, I am very grateful. Located in city center less than 10 min walk from Syntagma Sq. I just stayed one night but could see everything is functional clean and well maintained. The room is big and cosy. It is on the back side so no street noise but rather loud ventilation device noise from the courtyard, though. It is an old building so expect acoustic insulation between rooms to be bad - I had a hard time to sleep since a couple was having a thick conversation until very late in the opposite room. I guess the situation does not happen every day and I would be happy to come back in my next visit to Athens!"

While it is stinking hot outside, the room due to its high ceiling and lovely stone walls, was quite pleasant with only one fan on during the night.. Big comfortable bed for a tired body, from walking around all day :-)<br/>All amenities seemed to be available and there didn't appear as though anything wasn't there that one might need..<br/>Alisa was a lovely host. Had interesting and thoughtful conversation with her.<br/><br/>Would definitely try to book a room here again if I was to visit Athens again.. <br/><br/>P.S.<br/>Literally 10's of metres around the corner from this place is Vegan Beat..<br/>It has a Gyros with no grains nor animal products in it yet tastes absolutely delicious and virtually the same as any Gyros I've eaten when I was a meat-eater :-)<br/>It's a place to take a non-vegan where you know they will be impressed.."

We had no issues with noise at night whatsoever, only possible complaint was that the days we stayed were so warm it was hard to keep the room cool.<br/><br/>Check-in and check-out both went great and the host's coffee shop is so close to the place it's a nice and convenient way to start a touring morning.<br/><br/>Would definitely choose to book again if I went back to Athens"

13977476,96681190,2016-08-23,89474463,James,"This was my first experience with AirBnb and Kimon and his father were the perfect Host. The listing description was accurate and the neighborhood was as expected for the location. Kimon escorted us from the Metro upon our late arrival to the apartment due to our delay in traveling. He would check with us during our stay to see if there was anything we needed. Due to a family emergency, Kimon and his father were very empathetic with our situation and our pre-mature departure from the apartment. We truly appreciated all their assistance and understanding. We would recommend and stay again at their AirBnb apartment.  "
13977476,99392333,2016-09-04,22720058,Nicklaus,"Kimon was an excellent host in every way you could imagine. First off, his response time was quick, meaning he would reply within a twenty minute time frame. Kimon and his father both met us upon arrival to the Kolonaki area where he gave us a detailed, and fairly easy location to meet up which was across the street from the actual street. They were both very kind and volunteered to show us around the area at all the main attractions within walking distance from the apartment. Kimon was very nice and left us with a detailed map of the city of Athens, along with a calling card just incase we had to contact someone in an emergency (we have american telephones). Overall, my experience was amazing in Kimon's apartment, and I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to visit the city of Athens! It was a beautiful apartment with everything you need to experience a comfortable stay in Athens. Also, the apartment has 2 big rooms, and could fit a way bigger family than just 2 people. I will definitely return to this apartment every year that I return to Athens, Greece!"

<br/>Ils nous ont indiqué l'itinéraire pour rejoindre l'appartement depuis l'aéroport, puis Georges est venu nous attendre à la station pour nous accompagner chez lui. 
<br/>L'appartement était propre, et conforme à la description. Il avait fait en sorte de nous faire sentir les bienvenus, et nous avait préparé une petite collation. Il nous a  donné des conseils concernant les lieux touristiques, et nous a laissé son numéro de téléphone afin de pourvoir le contacter si besoin.
<br/>Très serviables et disponible, une bonne adresse! "

Sur le chemin vers l'appartement, nous avons communiqué en anglais sur un ton très amical pendant les 5-10min de trajet. 
<br/>Arrivé à l'appartement, le père et la mère de Kimon nous ont accueillit en prenant bien le temps de nous détailler tous les aspects de l'appartement. L'appartement était fidèle aux photos : grand, propre, rangé ainsi que parsemé d'intentions délicates qui ne figuraient pas dans le descriptif (notamment les bouteilles d'eau fraiches).  
<br/>Avant de nous laisser, le père de Kimon nous donna son numéro de téléphone ainsi que celui de Kimon au cas où nous en aurions besoin.
<br/>En dépit du fait que nous devions nous en aller vers les 3h00 du matin, le père de Kimon était très arrangeant pour l'état des lieux et nous a permis de quitter l'appartement en temps afin de ne pas manquer notre vol."

Kimon and his parents were lovely to communicate with and ready for every possible need. The apartment was extremely clean and fully equipped especially the kitchen. It's also next to the most beautiful areas of Athens to go on foot. Good times, I would definitely recommend this place to any visitor!"

Arrivé à l'appartement, le père et la mère de Kimon nous ont accueillit en nous détaillant tous les aspects de l'appartement, et en nous offrant fruits, chocolat et bouteilles d'eau fraiches."

Ce sont des gens d'une gentillesse inouïe et rare. Ils nous expliqué où se situaient les commerces proches et les monuments à visiter et ont été des amours avec nos filles. Tout était identique à la description. L'appartement est extrêmement bien situé pour visiter et se promener dans la ville . Si nous retournons à Athènes, nous retournerons dans cet appartement."

13977476,116149853,2016-11-28,98522579,Ana,"I loved everything about Kimon's apartment. It was walking distance to all major tourist locations. I had already bought a 3 day all inclusive transportation pass and I only used it once because everything was so close even restaurants and supermarkets. Kimon's dad picked us up from the train station and he was the sweetest man, walked us to the apartment, showed us everything we needed to know! Even bought us some water, he also showed me some restaurants and markets around the apartment. Kimon's mother was so sweet as well, overall just a wonderful family. The apartment itself is very spacious and well equipped. We seriously felt like at home. If you're looking for a luxurious apartment this might not be for you, as this is more of a rustic typical Greek home. I will definitely recommend this to anyone looking to feel like a local. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Greece, thanks Kimon!!!!!"
13977476,129515214,2017-01-31,11606715,Matej,"We were met by Kimon's parents, who are very nice people.

13977476,134056498,2017-02-26,14368525,Ashwani,Kimons place is very close to all the attaractions so they are within walking distance. The neighbourhood has some really nice & affordable restuarants & shops plus supermarket for necessities. Kimons father was our host & he was extremely helpful & provided us all the information we needed. He & his wife invited us for lunch at their place near the beach one day. They were really friendly & great people. I would easily reccomend this place to anyone visiting Athens. We look forward to another visit

The apartment is lovely and very well located. All the beds were comfortable and we were warm with all the blankets that we're provided. The kitchen has everything you need , but not a kettle. The sofa bed is very comfy and there is enough space for 4 people. The shower is a little difficult.<br/>All in all we had a very good stay and would come back soon!"

Отец Кимона встретил нас в метро, несмотря на то, что наши смс- сообщения не были доставлены Кимону (а вернулись нам назавтра). Кимон был всегда на связи и дал подробные советы как добраться из аэропорта, включая расписание. Действительно основные достопримечательности в шаговой доступности и вполне можно обойти пешком. Спасибо Кимон  и Джордж!"
13977476,163744688,2017-06-25,102196629,Juan Carlos,Kimon and his family were so nice with us. The apartment worths the money and is quite near to the city center. I would encourage my friends to book it! 
13977476,168242476,2017-07-09,67914187,Petya,Kimon was very polite and hospitable. He even met us at Rafina port and gave us a lift to the apartment in Athens. The place has perfect location at the city center walking distance to all the attractions and places to visit.  
13977476,172529745,2017-07-21,78824770,Jeff,"One of the reasons I booked this place is from all the other reviews.  They were all accurate. Kemon and his father were very helpful and we spent one week in the apartment and truly felt more like a local then just another tourist in a hotel.  If you are coming from the states and are accustomed to living in a house, this place will feel a bit small but don't let that detour you.  Location is perfect and price was great for the week.  Get your morning espresso and a great bagel at Kekos two blocks left out the front door across from Dominos pizza....  local prices and so friendly."

Die Kommunikation mit Kimon lief hervorragend, auch während des Aufenthalts. Zusätzliche Tipps rund um die Stadt, was man nicht in den Reiseführern findet, waren gegeben."
13977476,263084601,2018-05-11,121196045,Nina,"Very nice place. Cozy flat with all amenieties needed. Grate location in residential area, but in walking distance from all main attractions. National Garden is nearby, and it's a pleasure to walk through it going to the center. There is a 24h cafe ""Elias"" nearby ( in 3 min walking distance) where you can have coffee, inexpensive cakes, ice-cream, pastries, sandwiches - very convinient, ideal for breakfasts. The area itself is nice, with a number of local, less touristic cafes. For example, the great place for gyros, skewers, salads is a small place called ""Piggy"", in 7-8 min walking distance.<br/>Kimon is a perfect host, very helpful and supportive. Stayed here with my 2 daughters, 15 and 9 years old. We all really enjoyed our stay."

The apartment was very clean and tidy and has all the needed stuff, some we can't even find in 5-star hotels. Can't imagine anything better for the same $$$. In the heart of the Kolonaki area (near large embassies and superb pubs and restos streets) and one metro station from the acropolis!"
13977595,104041162,2016-09-25,19069872,Emily,Beautiful home and incredibly accommodating hosts.  Alex is well connected with other local entrepreneurs and provided us with local toiletries and services.  First floor location and walking distance to many athens attractions.

13977595,110258727,2016-10-25,67372548,Carlos,"My wife and I had a great experience at Alex & Maria's studio! It is really a cosy place. We recommend it to any couple visiting Athens, even for the first time, which was our case.
<br/>
<br/>Alex and Maria were very supportive since we booked, contacting us before we arrived, giving us instructions to get the keys and about the studio, leaving water, coffee and wine - thank you! - ready for us, toiletries, fresh towels, books, magazines, etc. They didn't hesitate to call my US cell number when I was given the wrong code for the key box by mistake and they gave me the correct code right away. 
<br/>
<br/>They responded all messages promptly, always helpful and kind. 
<br/>We had a great time in Athens, the studio was part of it, Alex and Maria support even more!
<br/>
<br/>Thank you, guys!"

13977595,125143243,2017-01-04,14710101,Leni,"Alex was a wonderful host, great communication and super helpful to show us around the flat and recommend places to visit in the surroundings.
<br/>He welcomed us with our choice of wine, and left a nice gift for new years which was very thoughtful.
<br/>The flat is cosy and clean and has everything you could need, including toiletries, snacks and drinks. Equipped with AC which is great both in winter and in summer.
<br/>It was a fantastic stay, in a great neighbourhood and we would definitely come here again!"

Some wonderful shops , apartment really comfy , would have loved a balcony to sit out in but there is a fab coffee place and square right outside the door so all good ...new bed amazingly comfortable and nice decor ... felt very safe ...

13977595,138524434,2017-03-20,57101793,Daphne,"Alex is an excellent host, very cary and helpful. Every time I needed something he was there to help!  I loved the apartment it was so cute and very calm, excellently equipped and the perfect place to relax in the heart of my beloved Kolonaki. Easy access, near to all the cafes, restaurants, bars and shops! And so good price:-) I definitely recommend the place!"

13977595,148806579,2017-05-01,7542844,Daniel,Our stay with Alex & Maria was 10/10. The service Alex provided was above and beyond. The airline lost my luggage and Alex came to our apartment and brought his own clothes that night so that I would be comfortable. He also provided phenomenal recommendations that made our trip to Athens! I recommend this apartment 100%
13977595,153180209,2017-05-20,82577285,Shimaa,"Highly recommend Alex and Maria's place! It's in an excellent location - Kolonaki is the high-end neighborhood of Athens - and is very safe. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to Syntagma Square, 20 minute walk to Monastiraki, and about 30 minute walk to the Acropolis ticket booth, all enjoyable walks. It's also close to so many restaurants and shops. The interior of the studio is very nicely decorated, with all of the amenities you'll need. Alex was incredibly responsive with all communication, regularly checking in to make sure we had everything we needed. My friend arrived earlier than the check-in time, and they very easily accommodated an earlier check-in as there was no one staying the night before. Also, there was a ferry strike that ended up unexpectedly prolonging our stay in Athens, and Alex called me to make sure that we were doing okay, and easily arranged for us to stay at their place for a couple more nights. I absolutely recommend staying here; if I'm ever in Athens again this is where I'll be staying!"
13977595,155834644,2017-05-29,36766910,Katarzyna Izabela,"Great place to stay in Athens and great hosts. The apartment is close to most of atractions, well-equipped and clean.

Really great Greek hospitality. Definitely walking distance to what I came to visit: documenta 14 and the acropolis plus other ancient sites. Good food in the neighborhood, shopping near by, sites just a little further! I recommend it. "
13977595,159409928,2017-06-11,15794333,Melissa,"Maria and Alex are excellent hosts. We had clear communication about how to let ourselves in. They had great tips for places to eat/drink in the neighbourhood. They were attentive but never intrusive. If we needed anything it would be hanging on our door within minutes. They even set up the TV to go straight to the BBC when we turned it on as i'd mentioned we wanted to watch the election results. The apartment is lovely and location is fantastic - a quiet apartment just minutes from a very lively eating/drinking area, and walking distance to major museums, public transport hubs, and the Acropolis. Highly recommend and we'd be happy to go back any day  "
13977595,160287352,2017-06-13,57573217,Vivi,"Love that apartment sooooo  much! Nice host and nice decoration, so warm and lovely welcome drinks and snack. Plus BBC world channel very considerate <3!<br/><br/>Hope to come to Athens soon!"

13977595,176463341,2017-07-31,13035468,Charo,"This is the perfect place to stay in Athens. The apartment is very comfortable. Clean and everything you need. We arrived late at ninght and we found water; juice; coffee, wine:) and some snacks. And the owners were all the time very helpful and communicative. The last day they even left us some snacks in the door for our flight back. So kind! And the area is very nice and quite, you feel very safe. You can walk easily to the main touristic points. Very nice bars and coffees, and a supermarket at the end of the street.I recommend the apartament to anyone visting the city and even the surroundings because its proximity to the syntagma square train and metro."

Not only was it perfectly located (walking distance from the Acropolis and Lycabettus!) it was one of the nicest AirBNBs we've stayed in. And the hosts took care of so many thoughtful details... but I'll let those be a surprise for you when you stay. Communication was great as well!

13977595,216710316,2017-12-05,32281360,Elena,"I will start by saying, that this was by far the best Airbnb experience I have ever had, and I do travel frequently with high expectations for my accommodation. The communication with Alex was outstanding, last minute arrangement couldn't be any easier! (I was caught by surprise how accommodating a host can be) The flat... spotless clean, really stylish and at the best and safest location of Athens. The check in experience was smooth, and I felt really welcomed able to relax at a nice ambiance studio and a comfortable bed. There are many details to catch the eye in this property, but the most important one, everything is really thought through, so you will really feel as easy as in your own home. I recommend this experience to anyone visiting Athens for bussiness, leasure and a mix of both|! I will definetely be visiting again. Thanks again Alex, and keep up the good work!"
13977595,223416076,2018-01-01,53125871,Ioannis,"This place has a great location and is very conveniently situated in downtown Athens. While central, it is also quiet and a great place to relax.

13977595,266433526,2018-05-20,13164356,Jessica,This apartment is in a good neighborhood in Athens and the hosts are very communicative. We had some issues with check-in and it was very late at night but they immediately did all that they could to help. The apartment is pretty big for Athens but smaller than some might expect. It has very high ceilings which was great. The hosts left some nice touches of toiletries and slippers for us which was very kind.

13977595,454351977,2019-05-18,26276528,Joy,"I loved this place! It's on a quiet street close to the Lykavittos mountain (only 15-20 minutes to the top for people who like a good walk) and a few minutes up the street from a lovely organic market, pharmacy, ATM, nice shopping, and a lot of sidewalk cafes. I walked all over central Athens from here. The space is small but comfy and had everything I needed. To me, it was the perfect place for my first time in Athens and would be just as nice for a return trip. Airport transfer was easy -- the hosts work with a driver who can be booked online and who got me all the way inside to the apartment. This made arrival after a long flight a breeze. For 1-2 people, this place can't be beat!"

In my case to work online and to enjoy the space as much as out side than it's different. <br/>There is a mini kitchen but not equipped. Coffee machine but no capsules. <br/>Small balcony, no view. No breeze and no fresh air coming through in the room. <br/>Plus: close to center, close to everything, in a very good area.<br/>Besides my personal issues with this room, I do not consider this high rated at all and I have a lot of air bnb experiences."

Alex and Maria gave us good answers to all our questions and the best thing was the private driving company they cooperate with. Make sure to book them! We could even leave our bag with them while we went to Hydra for two nights. Afterwards, they would pick us up again and bring us (and the bag) to the airport."

The apartment is exactly as it is in the pictures and includes everything that the host promises. The view from the balcony is really amazing and access to public transport is easy as there is a bus stop just on your doorstep. Furthermore, there is a 24 hour grocery shop opposite the building. I would definitely recommend Ira to friends that go to Greece and whenever I visit Athens I'm definitely going to stay at Ira's again. "

13982635,125912167,2017-01-08,71501993,Karol," Efi is a wonderful very helpful host who took great care of us, waited until 1 am. so that we could collect the keyes after arriving late at night to the airport and helped us one night when we accidentally locked the keys inside the apartment. Mostly recommanded!!!"
13982635,133379414,2017-02-22,67469893,Meredith,"The apartment is beautifully furnished, well-equipped, and comfortable - we stayed for 2 weeks but could easily live here full time! Ira was welcoming and responsive. The balcony is absolutely gorgeous with a stunning view, lovely for morning coffee and even eating meals if the weather allows (we were there in February but wished it was summer so we could take more advantage of it!). We usually cook for ourselves and the kitchen had everything we needed to feel like we were in our own home. The location worked well for us - close to parks for jogging, easy access by foot or transport to the center but with a more residential, 'real-life' feel. We highly recommend this apartment. "
13982635,136490049,2017-03-11,54428783,Martyn,Another lovely stay in Ira's beautiful home
13982635,141823602,2017-04-05,61706141,Anne-Catherine,"We stayed for one week and we were absolutely happy about our choice for Iras apartment. It's in the center of Athens and has a beautiful view from the rooftop- terrace. The flat is very cozy and classy furnished. We got everything we needed and felt very home dring the stay. Ira is very nice and helpful, there were no problems. Thank you very much!"
13982635,143474125,2017-04-12,115328061,Laure,L'appartement d'Héra est extrêmement confortable et luxueux; chaque détail a été pensé avec soin. La vue sur le Lycabette est également très appréciable.

13982635,152101681,2017-05-15,22625494,Sunna,"Ira was very lovely and responded quickly. She made check in and check out very easy for us. The apartment was very clean, very beautiful and cosy - also well equipped. The view from the big balconies is amazing and to be able to spend some time there when not downtown is a big plus. A store just opened right across the street - and that was also a big plus. Overall a great experience and we definitely recommend!"

Very quick to respond to any questions also. "
13982635,161548253,2017-06-18,4936615,Tanya,"We loved Ira's place -- it made our Athens experience unforgettable. Ira was extremely flexible with the check in and her apartment had everything, in addition to the gorgeous view of the beautiful Athens. Ira's place is located in a quiet residential part of the city -- we walked everywhere and enjoyed getting to know Athens on foot. Obsessively clean, comfortable, with a huge terrace!"
13982635,164098420,2017-06-26,59074124,Rachel,"Ira's place is extremely clean, spacious, and fully equipped with products, food, towels, clean sheets, etc... there is a beautiful wrap around balcony that provides great views of the city.  Close to good eats in Exarchia."
13982635,165453418,2017-07-01,5121894,Penny,"This apartment is spectacular!! We highly recommend it to anyone staying in Athens! It's beautiful, comfortable and spacious with double aspect balcony facing south and west so great views. Despite being above the busy avenue Leof. Alexandra's you can hardly hear the traffic. The area is quiet and peaceful but within walking distance of the hip student area of Escarchia, full of great restaurants and interesting shops. The bedroom is spacious with a really comfortable bed , the bathroom is dazzlingly luxurious, perfectly equipped kitchen and very comfortable lounge. We arrived in a heatwave with temps in 40's but this flat provided a real cool sanctuary.  Fantastic! And Ira is a wonderfully warm and kind host, waiting to welcome us when we arrived late and making sure we had all we needed. Definitely stay here if you are coming to Athens, you won't regret it!!"
13982635,183022475,2017-08-16,32243868,Pm,"Ira's apartment is a great find! It's not far from Exarchia and is just beautifully decorated with an amazing terrace that must be seen to believe. Ira herself is sweet and sympathetic - an excellent hostess. All in all, a wonderful stay."
13982635,189576587,2017-09-02,14866455,Constance,"Ira is a wonderful host. My flight to Athens was delayed and my luggage was lost. By the time I arrived at the flat, I was tired and miserable. But, Ira had wine and food in the refrigerator and told me to help myself. She had fresh towels, toiletries, and even a toothbrush I could use. Her flat is amazing. Sitting on the verandah in the morning and again in the evening was exquisite."
13982635,193596493,2017-09-14,64392922,Nataliia,"The place is amazing with an incredible view. Definitely worth staying there, enjoying coffee in the morning or wine in the evening on one of the most beautiful balconies I've ever seen. We were allowed to check in early in the morning, which was super nice. The walk to the center will take some time, but on the way there, you can find many other good sights to explore. Will definitely stay here again when I come the next time."
13982635,198307727,2017-09-29,147834120,John,Beautiful apartment.   Great outdoor deck space.  Very comfortably appointed interior.  35 minute walk to downtown sites and a short walk to National Archaeological museum.  Hpa was a great host and the experience was amazing.
13982635,202425652,2017-10-11,5509829,Barb,"All the glowing reports about Ira and her exceptional apartment are absolutely true! It’s hard to add anything further! We had flight delays and arrived late as others have done and Ira was most accommodating waiting up for us and even ordering a taxi to meet us and keeping the taxi company informed of the delays.<br/><br/>We were welcomed as honoured guests but left as firm friends. Ira is obliging over and above a super host. I asked whether she could recommend a hairdresser. She not only did so but accompanied us there. Brilliant experience so much so that we tossed our plans to venture further in Greece preferring to stay here. We will definitely return to Athens and will stay nowhere else. Remarkable experience, remarkable host, recommended unreservedly. So grateful that Ira shared her home with us and gave us her friendship. You can’t do better."
13982635,204629130,2017-10-19,55649546,David,'Hpa's place was in a good location walkable to all the sights.  The home was spacious and the patio was one of the best spaces we've encountered in our Airbnb history. We always tried to get back by 4pm to hang out with a glass of Vino and enjoy the last rays of sun.
13982635,211152706,2017-11-12,47580036,Ioannis,Hra's place is as shown on the pictures. Very nice top floor apartment with everything you need and not noisy. The kitchen was very well equipped with a lot of things that Hra had left for us. The apartment was also extremely clean with a  mild smoking  odor that might be an issue for a non smoker. The bathroom was awesome! Thanks a lot for the hospitality!

Безупречно чисто, удобная кровать, есть всё необходимое и даже больше! А уж какой вид на Афины открывается с огромной круговой террасы! Жаль, что у меня была всего ночь и полдня, чтобы насладиться всей этой красотой! Стильная хозяйка квартиры Ира встретила нас прохладной бутылкой белого вина, а в холодильнике было всё необходимое для завтрака. Ира, спасибо! Вы - потрясающая женщина!"

13982635,267125425,2018-05-21,8701129,Nathalie,"Nous sommes restés une semaine et notre séjour a été vraiment très agréable. Hera nous a très aimablement accueillis en nous fournissant des informations pratiques. Nous l’avons rencontrée 2 autres fois et elle s’est montrée la fois disponible, discrète et chaleureuse. <br/>L’appartement est beau et chaleureux dans sa décoration. Il forme un angle entre une petite rue calme et l’avenue Alexandra. La chambre et le salon sont vastes et lumineux et l’air y circule bien. La bonne surprise est que la terrasse fleurie est si vaste qu’elle fait tout le tour de l’appartement ; elle est si bien aménagée (3 tables, des chaises, des fauteuils et des bancs confortables) que nous y avons pris tous nos repas en contemplant le mont Lycabette tout proche. <br/>Chez Hera, tout est confortable, à commencer par le lit et les canapés. L’appartement est très bien équipé puisque c’est le lieu de vie de note hôte, et tout l’équipement est de bonne qualité. L’appartement est même très plein et Ira nous a laissé toutes ses affaires personnelles à disposition, ainsi que des provisions, et c’était bien agréable. <br/>Le quartier est très bien desservi par 4 lignes de bus qui nous emmènent notamment au métro Ambelikipi sans jamais attendre plus de 10 mn, même tard le soir. On peut aussi aller à pied au musée archéologique et à Kolonaki en faisant une jolie promenade. Pour faire les courses, c’est très pratique : il y a une supérette juste en face de l’immeuble, une bonne boulangerie à 5 mn à pied sur l’avenue, un supermarché à 10mn et un marché en plein air de fruits et légumes locaux à 5 mn le mercredi. <br/>Nous avons choisi cet appartement pour être un peu à l’écart des quartiers touristiques et c’est un bon choix. <br/>Nous remercions Hera pour sa gentillesse et sa générosité."
14010214,164442831,2017-06-27,115374341,Guillaume,"A notre arrivée, Yiannis était très accueillant, nous avait mis des bouteilles d’eau au frais (non négligeable au vu de la chaleur) et nous avait acheté des cookies. L’appartement est bien situé dans la ville, et bien desservi avec l’arrêt de bus BRAÏLA au bout de la rue, et des correspondances assez souvent. <br/>L’appartement en soit est bien, et possède 2 terrasses. Nous avons disposé du nécessaire, et même si nous n’avions ni casseroles ni ustensiles au début, Yiannis est venu nous en apporter le soir-même. <br/>Les chambres étaient assez grandes, et il y avait de la place dans les armoires. Cependant, dire que l’appartement dispose de 6 couchages semble être abusif. Il y a 3 vrais lits : 2 lits simples dans une chambre, et un lit double (néanmoins assez petit pour 2) dans une autre chambre. Les 2 derniers couchages sont à trouver dans le salon : 1 sur le canapé (qui n’est pas un clic-clac, juste un canapé) et 1 autre sur un lit de camp avec une mousse pour matelas. Comme solution, nous avons rapproché les 2 canapés et mis le lit de camp entre eux, de façon à avoir plus de place. On s’est débrouillé pour une semaine, mais ce ne fut pas d’un confort incroyable.<br/>L’appartement ne dispose pas de climatisation, mais de ventilateurs dans chaque pièce. Cela rafraîchit très légèrement la pièce, mais n’est de loin pas aussi efficace qu’une réelle climatisation (Website hidden by Airbnb) La table du salon est petite pour 6 et peu large pour y mettre les assiettes et les plats (Website hidden by Airbnb) Nous avons profité d’une connexion wifi via un appareil portable. Idéal pour l’emmener dans la ville et se connecter à internet SI TOUT FONCTIONNE BIEN.<br/><br/>Dans l’ensemble c’est un bel appartement, bien situé, mais il faut faire attention aux couchages et à la ventilation. À conseiller pour un groupe d'amis, pratique tout de même."
14010214,174782524,2017-07-27,27965444,Daniel,Yiannis was great and we had a good time. He was very helpful! 
14010216,98296454,2016-08-30,35824826,Antonia,"Perfect stay in Athens! We had such a great time at this beautiful place. Fotis and Elpida did everything to make sure we felt right at home and were great hosts. The apartment is so unique and in a trendy area with lots of bars, restaurants and cafes nearby. Lovely views from the rooftop terrace. Would highly recommend for anyone visiting Athens!! "
14010216,105033268,2016-09-30,45078863,Justin,"In my opinion one of the best Airbnb's in town! It could not have been better. Elpida&Fotis where amazing hosts and welcomed us with lot's of local tips, with a kitchen and fridge full of fruits and homemade jam and many other things and generally equipped with everything you could possible hope for. The location is amazing too, everything is walking distance from here. And great restaurants and cafes and a 24/7! Bakery are all around the apartment. The rooftop is another of the many great things about this place. To be able to just go up with a cafe or glass of wine and sit in the sun is priceless. There is very little traffic noise which is also a great plus given it's central location. Highly recommended! Thank you Elpida&Fotis for being such great hosts."
14010216,105870262,2016-10-03,19785675,Sabrina,The Location of this beautiful place is perfect. Close by foot to all of Athens attractions from sightseeing to cool restaurants and bars. The hosts are very friendly and very welcoming and gave us great tips to enjoy our stay. The apartment is exactly as it shows in the pictures. Very clean and fully equipped. Very artistic place to stay in. Great view and cozy at the same time. The terrasse is something to not miss in the afternoon! We enjoyed our stay in the apartment and would for sure recommend it and come back to visit again!

Fotis made us extremely welcome and gave some great tips about places to go around Athens. The flat felt like a real home from home and made us feel like one of the locals! "

<br/>We would definitely come back!"
14010216,108748292,2016-10-17,24175923,Antoine,"Nous avons passé 4 nuits dans l'appartement (du jeudi soir au lundi matin). Il est très agréable, bien équipé et super bien décoré. Le petit plus est clairement la terrasse sur le toit du bâtiment, idéale pour prendre un verre le soir.
<br/>L'emplacement est en plein centre de la ville et presque toutes les visites peuvent se faire à pied (max. 25 min pour aller au musée de l'acropole, qui est l'un des musées les plus éloignés / 5 min pour l'agora antique).
<br/>Elpida et Fotis sont très disponibles et ils nous ont donné d'excellents conseils pour visiter la ville.
<br/>L'appartement est dans un quartier très animé entourés de bars et de tavernes. Ceci participe au charme de l'emplacement, mais cela signifie également que l'on entend chanter les clients de la taverne en face jusque tard dans la nuit (surtout le weekend).

14010216,109703782,2016-10-23,11788400,Katrin,"What a wonderful house! We were three friends living in the house for 6 days in October and we can definitely recommend it. Our stay started with a warm welcome from Fotis, who gave us a lot of insider tips for the city and answered each question we had. The fridge was filled and the house was equipped with everything we needed. So we really felt like at home. They also thought about helpful details, like a hairdryer with diffuser, nail polish remover, umbrellas etc. We slept with two people in a double bed and one person on a Sofa with a mattress on it. Both were very comfy. There was also an expandable extra bed, that we didn't use. We all were in love with the extremely tasteful interior design. The location is a perfect beginning point for walks through the city ans also is close the Metrostation.  On weekends it gets a bit noisy by night, but that couldn't impair the overall great experience. Thank you!"
14010216,110592909,2016-10-27,17463467,Emma,"This apartment was amazing and a fantastic base from which to explore Athens. It was our first trip to Athens and, even though we arrived very late, Fotis met us and took us to a local bar to explain all about Athens and where we should visit! We felt very at home and comfortable and anyone coming to explore Athens should stay here!"
14010216,110901432,2016-10-29,12858652,Emma,"Great stay! The flat has an awesome view on a church and is decorated with taste. Great central location in Monastiraki, close to bars and restaurants (can be noisy for sensible ears) and sites. The flat has everything you could ask for! Fotis was very dedicated in explaining all we should see during our stay and answering all my questions. Will come back! Thanks!"

Charming slim build house with 3 floors and great view, close to the market, restaurants and metro-station. Clean and very well equipped, even with the suntan creme in the bath. We spent there one week and felt like at home. Highly recommended!"
14010216,114156596,2016-11-16,49617430,Nadège,"Appartement très sympa, bien décoré, dans un quartier vivant et proche de tout, bon accueil de Fotis qui nous a laissé un réfrigérateur plein et donné la meilleure adresse dans laquelle on ait mangé à Athènes. Par contre, l'appartement est très très bruyant à cause des bars et tavernes très proches qui diffusent de la musique jusqu'à très tard, au moins 3 ou 4 heures du matin. Les boules quies sont insuffisantes compte tenu du simple vitrage. En résumé, un appart très sympa, sur 3 étages, dans un quartier central, mais si vous voulez dormir et vous reposer un minimum, je ne vous le conseillerais pas. "

14010216,116919237,2016-12-04,12117784,Charlotte,"Elpida and Fotis apartment in the center of Athens was just perfect for our stay. We were five people (family) and the arrangement of the flat over several floors allowed for everyone to have enough private space. There is also a second small bathroom accessible from the hallway. The kitchen had everything we needed and was perfectly equipped, also the fridge was filled with delicious breakfast stuff when we arrived. All the basics are available and everything is super clean. The roof terrace and balcony are a big plus too. Especially the beautiful and inspiring style of the apartment impressed us! <br/>Also, the hosts were available all the time we were there and took care of every inquiry we had as soon as they could. It was a really good experience overall!<br/>One sentence to the location. It is really in the middle of everything, that should be clear when you book. For us, that was perfect, with restaurants and bars just a few steps away, and all that we visited were really good! However, on the weekend it can indeed get loud. Of course this is not the host's fault, they even offered consolidation of the neighbors in case it got too crazy. For us it was okay, we enjoyed the hustle and bustle and all the opportunities the district has on offer, so I give a five star rating. Thanks Elpida and Fotis!"
14010216,121579376,2016-12-18,3501687,Koen,Nicely decorated and spacious place. We stayed with 3 people in the house and had a comfy time. There's a well equipped kitchen and large kitchen table to have some breakfast which was already there for us in the fridge. Location is excellent to visit Athens main sights and explore its nightlife. You can hear this too but for us it was easy to sleep through.

The rooftop was awesome for an evening cocktail.  The kitchen was well equipped with utencils, and a few goodies in the refridgerator.  Fotis was always available.  Some of the best restarants in Athens were only a block away.  I look forward to returning to this best kept secret in Athens.  This is my Athens was also a great free Athens tour."

Only drawback of being in such a lively area is that it is quite noisy at night. If you don't mind this, look forward to a hip apartment distributed over 2 floors. Fotis' tips where to go were great as well. Can definitely recommend to stay there again."

We were 5 girlfriends visiting Athens for the Documenta Art exhibition and starting and ending the day on the amazing terrace with strawberries from Monastiraki square and fresh koulouria from the neighbourhood was so so amazing! We loved the area that was more local and price worthy and personal than Plaka area! We didn't miss anything during our stay and Fotis and Elpida were so helpful and such sweet people!

There are many restaurants surrounding the area and it is walking distance to the main activities. The apartment itself is huge and has everything you need to make yourself at home (kitchen stuff is always appreciated!). I had a very nice stay with my parents, sleeping in two different floors, having breakfast in the balcony upstairs, etc. Fotis was also very kind with us. Recommended! "
14010216,160256731,2017-06-13,30955205,Arden,"What an amazing space! Fotis was the perfect host. I told him we are vegetarian, so he made a list of restaurants and even mapped them for us. The recommendations were wonderful by the way. The apartment was just so darn cool. The decor was stylish, a little boho, but not cluttered. The private roof deck was incredible. This is in a very central area, very lively and only a very short walk from the metro (two lines, including the airport line). We will stay here again in a heartbeat. "
14010216,160930385,2017-06-16,24100079,Maddy,"We loved staying at Elpida&Fotis's place!<br/>The apartment was a great size for the three of us and very well decorated, we felt right at home which was nice while travelling.<br/>Walking distance to great food, markets and all the sights! <br/><br/>We hope to stay here again!<br/>"
14010216,162270671,2017-06-20,89512785,Marc,"This was my first experience with airbnb and if you're considering staying in Athens, rent this place at all costs. Fotis spent a half hour with us explaining the house as well as showing us different parts of town to visit. I would go again! "

14010216,163588994,2017-06-25,11852746,Kira,"Athen's was a pleasant surprise all around - including this fantastic apartment! The location can't be beat. While a little louder on the weekend (including an early a.m. wakeup due to the church bells across the way), it's nothing to be deterred by. All in all, a lovely place, with equally lovely and helpful hosts. "
14010216,164685380,2017-06-28,1439018,Frédéric And Niloufar,"This is a great place, with or without kids. The only issue, which is irrelevant to the place itself, as we had it everywhere we stayed in Greece in June/ July is Mustiques. Highly recommend this place, the terrace, the neighborhood, the decoration, the comfort of an AC and the great host. "
14010216,165197153,2017-06-30,19091472,Alba,"La casa de Elpida y Fotis es realmente genial! Es aún mejor que en las fotos y está muy bien situada, cerca del centro y con un montón de sitios para salir a comer y cenar. Además Fotis fue muy atento con nosotros que llegamos un poco tarde por un problema en el aeropuerto. Muchas gracias por todo !"

14010216,166977974,2017-07-05,9248454,Vibeke,"Veldig sjarmerendel, orginal og romslig leilighet. God planløsning, mye lys og fin utsikt til kirken. Topp belliggenhet! Lett å komme til alt, og koselig og livlig nabolag med små nisjebutikker. Vi ble tatt godt imot av Fotis, som var veldig hyggelig og behjelpelig. Vi har ingen betenkligheter med å gi leiligheten vår beste anbefaling."
14010216,168316323,2017-07-09,3572378,Kat,"What an amazing space. A multi-story apartment complete with a rooftop and outdoor space on the other floor. Everything about this place is near perfect, probably my favorite airbnb I've ever stayed in. "
14010216,169593733,2017-07-13,4178965,Raphaelle,"L'appartement d'Elpida&Fotis est magnifique et très grand. Il est en outre idéalement situé dans un quartier à la fois très vivant, avec son identité propre et proche de tous les centres d'intérêt de la ville. <br/>La communication à été fluide et agréable. Et nous avons été très bien accueillis malgré notre arrivée à Athènes à une heure tardive. <br/>Bref, un gros coup de cœur. "
14010216,171671066,2017-07-18,31591208,Domenico,"The flat fits very well with the description, it is one of a kind. The location is definitely central and very lively, though in our opinion also family friendly, being somewhat apart from the noisier streets around (neglecting Sunday bells from the church in front of the apartment ). The near and far neighborhood are very nice to visit, so we did not need much the metro (though monastiraki stop is close by). Supermarkets are relatively far, but the kitchen was already equipped with all basic staff and also unexpected items (nice wine bottle, olives, olive oil, cereals for breakfast, plenty of spices) and a little grocery and a bakery are very close. Elisa & Fotis were friendly and helpful before and during our stay. We waited a bit for accessing the apartment, but we were ahead of time with respect to the standard check in times. We also appreciated the possibility of a late check out from the apartment. All in all, very recommended!"
14010216,174423095,2017-07-26,66806931,Rebecca,"Anyone traveling to Athens should stay here! This is right in the heart of the action; shops, restaurants, and a short walk to the major sites. It's tucked away on a side street, so it's not congested, but you're still very close to everything! There are also some great restaurants right outside the door. I highly recommend Lithos for dinner. The apartment was clean and well situated. Elpida and Fotis are great hosts. They answered all our questions promptly and we're so nice. If we're ever back in Athens, we would definitely stay here again. I can't recommend it enough. "

Perfect situated near the Monastiraki Square. Elpida also was great. She gave us a lot of information about everything we needed and whenever we had a question she was ready to answer immediately and to our biggest satisfaction!"
14010216,180345332,2017-08-10,21871431,Caroline,"Definitely the most lovely AirBnb that I've encountered so far! The loft was just as described and in the photos, colorful, artsy and cozy that puts you directly in a good mood; and the rooftop! The location is more than central, not only did we walked literally EVERYWHERE during our 6 days of stay, it was just a matter of 5 mins to go food-hunting and drinking. Elpida and Fotis were extremely helpful and available, the checkin was easy and they gave us great tips for restaurants. <br/>All in all, straight up 5 star & recommandation ++++!"

14010216,191086780,2017-09-06,129337584,George,"Highly recommended for anyone staying in athens who doesn't want to be surrounded by tourists. We had high expectations based on the reviews, and it was even better than expected. This is a full townhouse plus rooftop terrace, so there is plenty of space and the location couldn't be better..close to everything but not at all noisy. <br/>The house is an industrial-style loft with a very nice view of an old church, and is very tastefully decorated (although the bathroom door is clear glass and could use some sort of privacy screen). The area has a very artistic and 'local' feel and not very touristy, yet is walking distance to everything (and less than 5 minutes to the Monastiraki square and metro stop).<br/> Fotis was a great host and had plenty of recommendations of places to eat and hang out which are off the beaten path, which is exactly what we wanted. The area has a very artsy feel and is covered with graffiti and street art, and feels completely safe even as we wandered a bit. Plenty of cool antique shops and other interesting stores and small restaurants right at your doorstep.<br/>Highly recommended for anyone who likes to get a sense of the culture when traveling. Thank you Fotis for the great experience!"
14010216,192377684,2017-09-10,6184211,Jeanne-Marie,We can't say enough good things about this apartment! Loved every minute. The location is SUPERB and the home was ideal. One of the best things for us was the pre-arrested val communication. Put our minds to rest and we were grateful for all the local recos. GREAT place and superb hosts!!! Til the next tine. :)

I think it is a good deal and would go for it. If you are sensitive sleeper you might have some problems as the restaurants straight near the building works until 3 pm and you can truly hear everything (no sound absorbance at all)."
14010216,199826747,2017-10-03,64666804,Christian,Lage und Appartement sind klasse. Der Empfang durch Fotis war ebenfalls prima und sehr informativ. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt absolut genossen und können es nur empfehlen.
14010216,201307040,2017-10-08,23044062,Bea,"Elpida & Fotis have been very kind and thoughtful of our needs. The house is beautiful and has a stunning rooftop terrace to enjoy the sunshine. The area in which the house is, is the perfect place for young people that want to go out in local Greek bars/restaurants with lots of local people. The noise at night during the weekend is loud but we will come back for sure!"

It has a private rooftop that is great for chilling out in the end of the day. There are 3 floors to the house ( with lot's of corners to explore if you have kids). Bathroom has a glass door (contributes to family bonding :) ).  All in all, great experience."

We just returned from the most wonderful stay at Elpida & Fotis' apartment and we can't stop talking about how much we loved every moment. You have the entire building to yourself, and the house is spacious, stylish and has all the comforts you need for your stay. The bed and couch are comfortable, the kitchen stocked with amenities and the rooftop terrace is a quiet retreat from the city. The house is centrally located to many hip cafes and shops, including vintage clothing stores and a store walk to the flea market. Less than a 5 minute walk to the metro and 20 minute walk to the Acropolis. They also provided us with lots of local insider tips for places to eat and drink and we loved them all. Check in and check out was very easy and they are so warm and welcoming. We hope to return next time we are in Athens."
14010216,205952263,2017-10-23,20934314,Rosa,Thanks to Elpida and Fotis . We spent really nice days in their place... like to be at home. Nothing better that stay in a city like a tourist and feeling at the same time “at home” as you would be in your place.
14010216,209324751,2017-11-05,54680785,Malissa,"Was a perfect place in Athènes, next to restaurants, bar and place. The rooftop it's amazing to enjoy a drink in front of the sunset.

14010216,213623392,2017-11-22,92891392,Chelsea,"Excellent location near restaurants, the metro and sights. The apartment was a little bit dated but was clean, had great decor and a very comfortable bed. <br/><br/>We didn’t hang out in the living room much as it was winter and there wasn’t heating there, but it looked like a nice area for the warmer periods. It got a bit too noisy for us on weekend nights (till late).<br/><br/>Didn’t get a chance to meet Elpida and Fotis but they were very nice hosts, helpful and responsive over email. They gave great recommendations for food/drink as well. Thank you Elpida and Fotis!"
14010216,219306673,2017-12-17,24494202,Francesco,"Sono stato nella casa di Fotis con la mia compagna e nostro figlio di 4 anni. La casa è luminosa, spaziosa e con dettagli curati. Ci sono angoli in cui sostare per leggere, ascoltare musica, bere una birra cretese molto amara o giocare a scacchi. Bellissima la terrazza. Il piccolo ha apprezzato lo stare su tre piani diversi e il potersi muovere liberamente da uno all’altro. La vita notturna e quella religiosa (c’è una chiesa ortodossa con le campane proprio di fronte) sono elementi da considerare perché durante il fine settimana si fanno sentire. Per noi comunque non sono stati un problema. Eccellenti ospiti. Consigliamo vivamente."
14010216,227790336,2018-01-16,3254338,Emilia,"We really enjoyed the stay in this appartment! Super fresh and clean, nice industrial and urban atmosphere and a lovely terrasse! Fotis is very friendly and helpful and gave us many local tips. This place is perfect for young people who want nice bars, cafés and restaurants within walking distance. If you’re sensitive to noise from the street you should bring earplugs or stay in a calmer area. Would stay here again!"
14010216,234307349,2018-02-12,19442436,Leonardo,"L'appartamento di Elpida è spazioso e situato in una posizione molto comoda per visitare la città. Lo stile dell'appartamento (e anche del quartiere) è giovane e alla moda. Unica raccomandazione: il posto diventa molto rumoroso di notte durante i weekend. I bar vicini sono affollati fino a tarde ore e si sente musica (anche forte) fino alle 4 del mattino il sabato notte. Sabato e domenica mattina le campane della Chiesa di fronte alla casa suonano presto e si sentono i canti della messa per svariate ore dalle 8 in poi. Durante la settimana però il posto è tranquillissimo e silenzioso in quanto lontano dal traffico. Consigliatissimo per ospiti giovani, eccetto per chi vuole farsi una buona dormita il venerdì e sabato notte ;)"
14010216,235870296,2018-02-18,108867924,Ellen,"We had a great stay at Elpida's place! The apartment is amazing, beautifully decorated and has loads of space. The roof terrace is great! The apartment is in a great location and is really clean. Elpida is really good at contact and responds straight away. The only thing that is worth noting is that the only bathroom in the apartment has an entirely see-through door in which you can view the person who is on the toilet from the bedroom! Not an issue for us but you should ensure that you know your group well enough to see them on the toilet!"
14010216,238568928,2018-02-26,106741904,Anna,"Great and stylish place! Comfortable location, and amazing view from the window and roof! Consider bringing earplugs if you’re noise sensitive, but we were perfectly Ok."
14010216,241668431,2018-03-10,157484882,Nedda,"Elpida was a wonderful guest host. The house is clean, lovely setting and filled with all the basics that one needs, we were very comfortable and did not need anything else, towels and toiletries were provided( shampoos, soap, first aid, nice hair dryer). Terrace nice to retreat to at night. Kitchen has all that you will need to prepare meals, comfortable beds. Area is central, and if you close the windows at night you will not hear a thing. The view of the church next door and its dome is fantastic, absolutely lovely. Restaurants galore just steps away, main Monastiraki square steps away with quick access to metro. View of acropolis at night gorgeous. Only be careful with pick pockets at and near crowded square, dont look like a tourist and hold your bags close and you will be ok. Elpida thank you for being a wonderful host, your place is so nice and we would most definitely come back. Maybe put a shield over the lovely clean glass bathroom door so that whoever uses the bathroom can have full privacy:) Thank you again, you are wonderful."
14010216,242984283,2018-03-14,134926114,Avner,"Elpida's house is a super stylish place in the heart of Athens old City. It is very close to  everything you might want to see or do, and during our 4 days of stay we didn't need to use public transportation at all. The apartment is big, very thoughtfuly designed and clean.    It also have a beautiful rooftop. One should keep in mind that at nights during weekends the street underneath is a little noisy as you can hear Greek music from nearby Tavern but the a big advantage is that there is almost no cars on that street. At the end of our stay we kind  of wanted to move in.... Elpida is super nice, hospitable, and answered every question we had. She shared great tips on places  to visit and she an amazing host."
14010216,246267040,2018-03-25,1178447,Anton,"We loved the place, it’s cool to have the whole house in the city center for yourself)) It is so welcoming that I wish we had friends in Athens to invite them to our place."

14010216,250504632,2018-04-05,8835587,Kirstin,"We absolutely loved Elpida’s apartment. The location could not have been more perfect both in terms of neighborhood and proximity to a great metro station (straight to airport and to Piraeus with no changes). The apartment was lovely and spacious. With a toddler, we really appreciated the separate spaces to hang out while she slept or napped. The roof deck was amazing, as were the balconies on each floor. If we were back in Athens, we would stay here again without question."
14010216,251124234,2018-04-07,192579,Anusha,Great host and a very cool apartment. Easy to work with and we enjoyed our stay a lot. Would love to go back to Athens and stay here
14010216,252600534,2018-04-11,30064020,Sadaf,This apartment is wonderfully located. It is an amazing space with everything you could think of. You are only a short walk away to all the hot sites in Athens. Elpida was very helpful when we arrived and showed us around. I would recommend this place to families and groups. The wifi is strong.
14010216,253684943,2018-04-15,5809728,Murielle,Un loft à la déco sympa et au roof top très agréable. Situation centrale très pratique. Très bon accueil et adresses sympas.  La soirée et nuit du samedi soir est effectivement bruyante mais ça reste bon enfant et des boules quies suffisent à dormir. C'est le quartier qui veut ça.
14010216,256660476,2018-04-23,30267579,Piotr,"The host, location, and space were both exceptional. She was very friendly and extremely helpful. The home was very hip and cozy. Everything was walking distance away. Very close to the train lines to the airport and to the port. <br/><br/>However, the noise level was far greater than we expected based on the  other reviews. One of the restaurants on the street had an amplified singer who went from 9PM or so til around 3:30 AM each weekend evening. It was unavoidably loud. The church across the street also got pretty noisy with loud chanting and bells on the weekends starting around 7 or 8 AM. We got up early so it didn't bother us much but it may be a problem for those planning on sleeping in.<br/><br/>That said, this is a perfect space for those planning on being out late into the evening and who want to be close to all the trendy bars and restaurants. We would definitely come back for a mid-week stay because there was so much to love about the place."

The apartment is so well situated in the middle of the city....we took the metro in & out of the airport which was very easy as there were no changes. & then we didn’t need to use public transport at all for our few days as everywhere was within walking distance! We had read that the street was a little noisy at night but that didn’t bother us or our children at all. The space is very stylish and welcoming. A great stay, thank you."

The bathroom door is clear and there is no privacy to use the toilet, which is in the main bedroom. The church bells ring very loudly, multiple tones in the early morning on Saturdays which was a surprise. However generally, the rooftop is lovely and peaceful."
14010216,269896868,2018-05-28,185627421,Rebekka,"Das Apartment hat uns wirklich gut gefallen, es ist sehr geräumig und schön eingerichtet. Die Lage ist super zentral und man kann alles gut zu Fuß erreichen, auch die Acropolis. Das einzige Problem war, dass wir Sonntagmorgen von lauten Kirchenglocken und Gottesdienst geweckt wurden, weil direkt vor dem Haus eine Kirche steht. Durch die sehr zentrale Lage ist es auch nachts am Wochende lauter, dafür hat man sehr viele Bars mit Live Musik direkt in der Nähe. Würde wieder hingehen."

Nestled in such a beautiful, unique corner of Athens, it provides a perfectly artsy, local experience in what might otherwise feel like a touristy part of Greece. The home is easy to get to via the airport, being so close to the train stations and a main hub for cabs. Upon arrival, we were blown away by the style of the place, loving especially the chalkboard wall by the large wooden table upstairs. We fit 5 comfortably, although the open floor concept took some creativity on day 1. The beds were comfortable! Also, the apartment offers many fun lounging areas, including the roof. The church across the street made for spectacular views and was perhaps too effective of an alarm clock when its bells rang/priest sang for a full hour Sunday morning. Most importantly, Elpida herself is a phenomenal host. She communicated openly with us, was outstandingly hospitable, and made our stay very easy. We highly recommend staying here!"
14010216,285557719,2018-07-04,16675055,Anna,"Elpida's apartment is amazing; there are three levels including a roof. Big windows, excellent location, a lot of space and plenty of room for 4-5 people. As other guests mentioned, it was laud on Saturday when we checked in, singing and dancing in restaurants nearby till 1 am, at Sunday morning church bells went on. But that is a city sound, and we enjoyed it. <br/>There is no microwave in the apartment and old scratchy frying pan (we were staying with kids and had to cook). An excellent bakery with fresh greek bread and pastry just around the corner."
14010216,288904656,2018-07-11,173924536,Emmanuel,Superbe lieu à Athène. On a adorė l appartement et le quartier. Séjour vraiment très réussi. On recommande fortement

14010216,290750602,2018-07-15,61220564,Elin,"This apartment is amazing, and Elpida is a great host! Me and my friends stayed there in the middle of summer, and Elpida was very helpful telling us how to get to the apartment, and answering any questions we had very quickly. We loved the urban and artistic decorating and style, the large windows facing a small, neighbouring church, and (maybe most of all) the large rooftop terrace, where we could enjoy a glass of wine while listening to the sounds of the city below. As it is also located in my favourite area of Athens, this apartment was a perfect match for me. It is a great area close to Plaka, Acropolis, the shopping streets and the Syntagma Square, while at the same time it's  a bit away from all of the most touristy places. I would definitely recommend this place."
14010216,292449356,2018-07-18,100588062,Damien,Perfect place to kick back and relax. Also in the perfect spot with food on the doorstep and all required facilities close by. Highly recommend this place for those who are looking to have everything within walking distance.
14010216,294373934,2018-07-22,33431664,Rosa,"Me and my family enjoyed our five days in Athens. We especially liked staying in Elpida apartment because of the big bathroom and the kitchen. The apartment is located in Monastiraki; a neighborhood with all Athenian must-sees in walking distance, and with a great variety of different restaurants, cafes and bars. The check in was easy-peasy, and all in all I would recommend Elpidas place to a friend. :-)"
14010216,297087265,2018-07-27,153593818,Hannah,"We loved Elpida’s apartment. It is even better than it looks in the photos. It is spread over three levels with the bedroom, bathroom and a lovely reading nook on the first floor; kitchen, dining and living area on the second floor which can accommodate more people to sleep and a roof top terrace with great views. <br/><br/>It is funky, eclectic and very tastefully furnished with everything you will need whilst there.  We were travelling with two kids and they loved all the space. <br/><br/>The apartment is in a great location with restaurants, cafes and bars close by. It is a minute or so from Montrseraki square which is pretty much the centre of the city. We did not use public transport as we could walk everywhere we went. <br/><br/>We would definitely recommend this apartment for a stay in Athens. <br/>"

A lot of space thanks to the two floors, not to mention a magic rooftop. Hips of bars and restaurants around. Strategic location to visit the Acropolis. Very precise and professional welcome by the owner Elpida. Would definitely recommend. "

Кондиционеры есть на каждом этаже,  но один работает слабо. Тихий проулок в оживленном районе для туристов.  Дверь в туалет  прозрачная , и в зоне видимости, что создавало неудобства для семьи из пяти человек.  Советы по ресторанам очень были полезны.  Нам понравилось"

Minor tweaks possibly for some, such as glass bathroom door which we didn't mind but some guests may want privacy. - church bells and singing in the morning g from the church opposite.. it was atmospheric but may wake late risers."
14010216,317978353,2018-09-03,5729079,Shane,very nice space but the stairs were a challenge with 2 small children. didn't stop us from having a wonderful stay and enjoying the quirky interesting area. <br/><br/>would highly recommend this Airbnb as a base to explore Athens and enjoy the local neighborhood. can honestly say that staying at this place MADE our Athens trip.

14010216,350359995,2018-11-19,95967951,Charles-André,"Epilda est très accueillante et met tous les ingrédients pour que le séjour de ses hôtes se fassent facilement. Sa maison est très accueillante et très bien située, proche de nombreux bars et restaurants, les sites touristiques sont accessibles à pied et le métro est à 5 min. Pour les gros dormeurs, l’endroit est assez bruyant avec des restaurants autours et les cloches de l’Eglise qui vous surprennent le dimanche matin de bonne heure. <br/>Parfait pour l’été et les fortes chaleurs, un peu moins lorsque la pluie et le mauvais temps font leur apparitions."
14010216,352300181,2018-11-25,11030549,Marthe,"We had a great stay with the 4 of us in this very cool and comfortable house! The 2 layers and the roof terras are very spacious and well equipped! Good beds (also the sofa Bed), great views from the roof terras and an absolute perfect location in the heart of the city. The bathroom has a door made of glass but luckily there is an extra separate toilet! We will definitely stay here again when back in Athens!"
14010216,353954283,2018-11-30,87937607,Augustin,"Le duplex + grande terrasse + 2 balcons d'Elpida est très spacieux et lumineux, décoré avec goût dans le 1er et 2ème étage d'un ancien petit immeuble industriel avec escalier dont la structure de la façade qui fait son charme peut laisser passer quelques bruits de l'extérieur comme elle l'indique dans son descriptif, mais possède le grand avantage de donner sur le chevet d'une charmante église avec 2 beaux arbres, chose rare dans un quartier aussi central, sur une petite rue sans voitures, avec de nombreux bars, restaurants et boutiques à la mode. Tous les sites et musées sont accessibles à pied, je n'ai pas eu besoin de prendre le métro en 4 jours. La maison était d'une propreté impeccable, et permet de bénéficier d'espaces séparés. Belle hauteur sous plafond. TV avec chaînes grecques et musicales. Elpida est une hôte extrêmement réactive et attentionnée, et la boite à clés sécurisée permet une arrivée et un départ tout à fait facilité. Nous avons passé un excellent séjour et je recommande vivement sa maison."
14010216,357690432,2018-12-11,104506311,Frank,Such a wonderful appartment at a great location! Elpida was very friendly and helpful. We had a problem with the heating and it was resolved very quickly!
14010216,359587832,2018-12-17,149403240,Yukio,"The place is in a really amazing location right in the center of Athens. Yet, it is not too noisy in the evening. The space is really stylish and clean and it was a pleasure enjoying breakfast on the nice rooftop. The only small thing you should consider when booking the space in winter is that it really doesnt get too warm due to the high ceilings. But this could also be a large advantage in the hot summers. Overall, we had a really amazing time here and I would definitively recommend it!"
14010216,363149428,2018-12-28,69607066,Paddy,"The location is fantastic, in a a pretty square and a wonderful district.<br/><br/>The space is really large and offers a lovely terrace.

14010216,364777259,2018-12-31,151326128,Elena,Possibly the coolest house in Athens!! Loved the layout of the house and it's interior plus the roof terrace perfect for breakfast in the winter sun. The house had all the necessary amenities and was easy to warm up considering houses in Greece can be cold during winter. The location is really central but can be a but noisy at night time but a pair of earplugs late night exploring of Athens night life resolves that. <br/>Communication with Elpida was perfect and entry to the property hassle free.
14010216,366700251,2019-01-03,183904587,Camilla,Elpida was very helpful with us and gave us a lot of nice information in a very precise way. The apartment is central and close to anything you might need!!! I definitely recommend it!
14010216,368091991,2019-01-06,35939578,Maximilian,Elpidas accommodation is simply amazing! It is located in a young and hip neighbourhood and is offering everything you'd wish. One of the many highlights is the roof top apart from other things where you can clearly see that somebody must have given many thoughts about the interior decoration. Definitely one of the best price/performance ratio listings I've been so far. Thanks again Elpida!

I have been here 5 days with 2 friends and we didn't want to leave! Big plus: the rooftop terrace where you can chill and look at the sunset and the blackboard where to leave all your messages in the kitchen!  Check-in and check-out really  smooth. Moreover the tavern right under the apartment is really food! We could not have wished for something better. STAY HERE!!"

Accessible to everything with great restaurants all around and not over run by tourists as nearby areas.  As well the space is really unique and stylish. Do note there are stairs so you need to carry bags up a flight.  We stayed as a family of 5 and loved the location and the space.

It has everything you need and there are cafes and restaurants wherever you turn your head in the neighbourhood. Elpida gave us very good instructions on how to find the apartment, so that was no problem. Everything was clean, and we really enjoyed our stay here."

14010216,494404983,2019-07-24,6505820,Anna,"Great location! Nice quiet space despite being in a busy neighbourhood. We had a car and had no problem finding a parking spot for two full days. We didn’t need the car so we locked it and left it in a manned lot. We were 2 adults and 3 kids under the age of 10 and everything was set up perfectly. Elpida’s suggestions for where to eat were appreciated! We ate at mavros gatos close by and it was amazing. The kids loved it. Also there is a fourno (bakery) a 1 min walk from the apartment which is really great with little kids.  One request I would make is for Elpida to add some more recommendations for restaurants close to Acropolis specifically because there’s just so many, it would be nice to know which one is good so as not to worry about where to eat when you’re tired and hot and have 3 little kids that don’t want to walk around!  <br/><br/>Communication was great. I highly recommend this location.<br/><br/>Σας ευχαριστούμε!"

We will definitely come back there if we have to return to Athenes ! Thanks for everything ! We already miss your place !"

14010216,536662112,2019-09-27,19651240,Marieke,Great place! Beautifully decorated in the touristic but hipe and  authentic neibourhood of Plaka. Despite of what we read in the comments we had absoluetly no problem with the noise of the cafés and restaurant down the street at night. We recommend!
14010216,541362296,2019-10-05,110113023,Yujung,"This place is wonderful to enjoy Athens, you can get to all the famous spots by walk so easily. <br/>The rooftop is epic! You could enjoy the sunrise with lighted up Acropolis and refreshen tiredness of long day. <br/>A bit noisy at night time but pretty okay. One thing you need to keep in mind is that there is pretty high steps of stairs to go up to room from main door, so you need to carry your luggage."
14010216,543153968,2019-10-07,20269526,Becca,This was a great stay and we had a great time! Right in the center walking distance to everything good! We would stay again

14010216,545862445,2019-10-13,61653886,Marine,"Amazing house with a rooftopin the center of Athens. The location is ideal (we did not have to take any transportation for the whole week-end except to go to the airport), and the house is decorated with a lot of taste.<br/>The neighbourhood is very lively, with many good bars and restaurants around, but it can get a bit noisy at night.<br/>To put it short, Elpida's house is definitely a good choice, I would recommend it !"
14010216,547517657,2019-10-15,11788107,Katherine,"Book this place if available! Great value with multiple common spaces and cute roof terrace. Would be most comfortable for 2 people in bedroom and 2 people on sleepercouch. We had 2 in bed and 1 on couch (not with bed pulled out, on top was very comfortable). Top location in cool neighborhood close to transit and historic sites. I’d come back!"
14010216,551363592,2019-10-20,24870197,Ulrike,It was a pleasure for us to stay at this place. Elpida contacted us right away and provided all needed information. The house was as expected beautiful and we had a wonderful stay in her place.

14010216,563210725,2019-11-12,225059750,Wolf,"Die Unterkunft ist sehr geräumig (2 Stockwerke + Dachterrasse), hell, modern und originell eingerichtet und gut z.B. für 2 Paare. Die Lage in Psirri ist hervorragend, in einer relativ ruhigen Ecke des inzwischen stark in Mode gekommen Viertels. Ein großes Plus ist auch die Sitzgelegenheit auf dem Dach. Allerdings: obwohl die Esopou-Straße kaum befahren ist, muss man mitunter spätabends mit beachtlichen Geräusch-Emissionen u.a. der umliegenden Tavernen rechnen und wird möglicherweise den Kühlschrank im 2. Stock nachts abstellen wollen, sofern man in diesem Raum nächtigt. Wenn man sich mit Oropax oder dem in jeder Apotheke erhältlichen örtlichen Pendant ""OtoFlat"" eindeckt, geht es einigermaßen."

I stayed there with two friends and we really enjoyed the house and were very happy with the location. It’s super easy to get to from the airport and you are within walking distance from everywhere in the city. If you are sensitive to noise then yes maybe ears plugs are a good thing to bring. Elpida is super helpful and makes sure her guests are happy. The beds are very comfy and everything you need is in the house. Super happy with choosing to stay in Elpida’s lovely house. Thank you!"

14010216,595982396,2020-01-21,97789916,Alek,"I absolutely adored this apartment with its personalised character that fitted so well into the area where its located. so much so that I felt completely as if I was staying at home. All my greek friends who dropped by to visit (I was there for an exhibition) wanted to live there. I love how its been decorated and the personal and comfortable touches. the upstairs sofa bed is the best i've slept in in an airbnb and the whole kitchen lounge space was great. the big wooden table allowed us to gather and have a great meal together. in fact for the first time I spent as much time at the apartment as out wandering my favourite areas of Athens - all super close by. one of the best things was the 2 monkey pines and church outside the window which gave a different view to the usual boxes balconies and tv dishes and aerials, and offered a insulation from nearby Ermou traffic sounds. Even the service on Sunday was pleasant. This is definitely a place I will look for again if I need to go to Athens, thanks Elpida for providing a wonderful experience, and for the help with extending the booking.<br/>ps - if the weather wasn't so cold I would have got a lot more from sitting on the wonderful rooftop terrace. so hopefully i'll have an excuse in spring to go back."

It's very close to the city center. <br/><br/>The accommodation is really good for up to 4-5 friends, but for 2 it's more than enough.<br/><br/>The only downside is the heating which I believe is not an issue during the summertime, but for chilly people, it's a downer (lots & lots of blankets available, though)."

Her patience, kindness and understanding of the situation was so appreciated, as was her consistently quick responses and great communication. The location was perfect for a stay in Athens, super central we hardly ever needed to use public tranportation or taxi, we could walk everywhere from the home. Yet it was off in a quiet street that felt private and calm. Thank you so much!!"

Make sure you have a data plan as there in NO WIFI. It was truly a little home with such character and a cozy feeling.

Η περιοχή είναι κοντά σε όλα τα βασικά μέσα μεταφοράς, ενώ η πολυκατοικία εδρεύει σε πολυσύχναστο και ασφαλές κεντρικό δρόμο. Οι ιδιοκτήτες ήταν πολύ φιλικοί και πάντα στη διαθεσή μας για το ο,τιδήποτε. Προτείνεται ανεπιφύλακτα σε πιθανούς επισκέπτες στην Αθήνα.<br/><br/>An ideal option for vacations in Athens. The apartment is located in a central street and the visitors won't be experiencing any disturbances as far as their security is concerned.

Nos hôtes étaient très à l'écoute et ont répondu à toutes nos questions! Ils ont été très arrangeants sur nos horaires d'arrivée (qui ont changé à la dernière minute) et surtout nos horaires de départ (très tardifs). L'emplacement nous semblait éloigné au départ, mais finalement en métro nous étions proches de tout ! Le quartier est assez dynamique et il y a même un supermarché au bas de l'immeuble.  Le seul petit bémol c'est que nous ne captions pas très bien dans l'immeuble et qu'il n'y avait pas de wifi, mais il me semble que c'est provisoire. Je recommande."

We especially enjoyed the little balcony with all the little plants. The furniture is kinda vintage but good quality, so if your tired of IKEA this is your place! There is a supermarket on the groundfloor which was veryin convient. The metro stop is just a 5 min walk away. Also there are lots of kioskes around where you can stock up on beer and candy 24/7. Since we both prefer a firm matress, we thought that the bed was too soft. But that is personal preference. I would recommend the place!"

Всё продумано для комфортного проживания гостей.  Учтена каждая мелочь. Квартира просторная двухкомнатная  и очень уютная. Интерьер дома ярко отражает колорит Греции. Обстановка  очень романтичная. Дворик  и подъезд уютные, абсолютно чистые. Очень приветливые соседи. С Костасом сложились  теплые дружеские отношения,  очень добрый человек. С ним  легко  можно договориться,  решая любые возникающие проблемы. Очень лояльный, доброжелательный  человек . Спасибо ему за решение наших проблем!  В квартире есть все электрические приборы, все они  в идеальном состоянии. Удобная широкая кровать, идеально чистое постельное белье, чистая ванная комната, красивая гостиная и шикарный балкон, где  мы ужинали в прохладе вечера. Квартира расположена в очень хорошем  районе.  Он находится немного в стороне шумного  от центра. Спокойный, тихий, безопасный. И в то же время он находится недалеко от центра города. До метро идти минут 15. Станция метро  Като Патиссия. И до центра  ехать минут 20-25. В соседнем  с домом здании находится большой  хороший супермаркет. На улице много разных магазинов. Один раз в неделю недалеко от дома работает большой продуктовый  рынок. Разнообразные свежие фрукты, овощи, большой выбор оливок  разных сортов, домашнее вино. Очень дешевый рынок. Много разнообразных и свежих морепродуктов.  Можно полакомиться свежими  продуктами прямо из моря по очень недорогой цене. Вечером, когда наступает прохлада, приятно прогуляться по этому тихому,  спокойному и уютному району. Красивый парк, фонтан и много ресторанов, таверн и дешёвых сувлацидико. Они готовят очень вкусный гирос, сувлаки. Продукты свежайшие . Недалеко от дома даже кинотеатр есть. <br/>     Отдых и дом, в котором мы жили, нам очень понравились. Недостатков в квартире нет. Если нам посчастливится, следующий отпуск проведем только в доме Костаса"

14018934,536571799,2019-09-27,140499641,Jennifer,"Looks just like the pictures. We arrived at midnight and check-in was a breeze. We never met in person but the host was very fast to respond to any questions we had. It was a little further from the metro station than we were expecting (15 min walk - longer if you are carrying your luggage), but you could always cab I suppose."

Even if it is located on a large avenue, the place was quiet. Dimitri and Eirini were really nice hosts. They provided a huge map of the city with good advice for our visits, homemade olive oil and bitter orange marmelade. Air conditioning was a +. Place situated 7-min walk from Ambelokipi metro station, which is great to get to the city center and pretty much any place we went to."

14034839,114521414,2016-11-19,59365563,Helen,Lovely clean and comfortable apartment. Under 10 minutes walk from Ambelokipi metro which is three stops from the centre of Athens. Huge bed which was really comfortable and the hosts came and changed the bed linen halfway though our stay which was nice. Kitchen had all we needed to prepare food and a large fridge freezer. Lots of storage space for hanging clothes. It is on the main road so noisy at the front with the balcony doors open but you can't hear a thing from the bedroom. <br/>There are loads of restaurants and bakeries and a big supermarket opposite. An ideal apartment to base yourself to explore Athens. Close to the Serum IVF clinic for anyone looking for a place to stay that feels like home. <br/>Dimitri was really helpful and provided lots of useful info and advice and was flexible when I had to extend my stay. Would stay here again :-)

They kept in contact with us the whole way through, from booking to check out. <br/>Dimitri even arranged to have a taxi wait for us at the airport and bring us to this home. He also had maps and gave us the lay out of the city, the metro/bus stops, and recommanded places to see and eat! <br/>They also bought some drinks and snacks for us.<br/>Very clean, organized, friendly, definately recommend."

14034839,136502827,2017-03-11,26661103,Mark,The flat was a perfect base from which to explore Athens. <br/><br/>Eirini and Dimitri were great hosts. They responded quickly to our questions and organised a taxi for us to the airport.<br/><br/>The apartment is conveniently located and there is a metro station nearby (under ten minute walk).<br/><br/>Great value for the space and we would highly recommend.
14034839,139046553,2017-03-23,66770238,Melanie,"Sehr saubere und geräumige Unterkunft. Sehr gute Infrastruktur direkt vor der Tür. Wenn man gut zu Fuß ist, auch kein Problem von dort aus zu Fuß in die City zu kommen. Leider ist die Hauptstraße sehr laut aber das Schlafzimmer ist nach hinten raus und absolut leise. Eirini und Dimitri sind sehr freundlich und stets hilfsbereit! Es war ein toller Aufenthalt."
14034839,142183256,2017-04-07,122981162,Marion,"It was our first time in Greece and we went to the apartment by metro (what was about 5 minutes walking distance). Dimitris waited for us and explained us everything. He was very friendly and helpful. The apartment is nice and clean and well located. If you walk to the centre it takes about 30 minutes but the taxis are very cheap. We paid between €4 - €6 to get to the city centre. Just pay attention with taxis you take in the centre itself, some drivers try to give you a 'special' price on forehand that is three times as high. Always ask the driver to turn on the taximeter, then it will be fine. <br/>There is a bakery next to the apartment, a big supermarket across the street and there are several restaurants nearby where we tried delicious Greek food.<br/>I really loved my stay in Athens and would recommend this apartment to everyone!

14034839,153430722,2017-05-21,121849667,Daniel,"The appartment is clean, spacious and at a great location with restaurants and shopping a short walk away. It is also near public transportation. Taking a taxi to just about any attractions in the city was less than 10 Euros. The most impressive part of the appartment are the hosts. Dimitri and Eirini are incredible. More guest oriented than hotels. They responded to text and emails within a minute or two. They also provided great guidance before and through my stay.  Even though the appartment is on a main boulevard, the bedroom was quiet.  Can't go wrong with this appartment, I highly recommend. "

Their flat is convenient to public transport and even for walking to Athen's sights if you are keen to keep fit.  It is also suitable for self catering with a kitchen and supermarket across the road.  We loved our stay there."
14034839,164656702,2017-06-28,16564162,Becky,"Eirini's place is clean, spacious, and in a great location for exploring Athens. We chose it because a lot of reviews for more central apartments said that noise was an issue. Eirini's apartment was in a quiet and safe neighborhood but an easy metro ride to anywhere in the city. We did find it difficult to get to/from the metro with luggage, but we found that to be true for most areas of Athens. We would definitely stay again for Athens sightseeing! "

Coffee shop and bakery downstairs, supermarket across the road and close to the metro. We didn't meet Eirini, but met her husband Dmitri who was really helpful, gave us lots of recommendations on where to go, what to see and some restaurant suggestions. Would definitely recommend their place if staying in Athens again"

14034839,190359156,2017-09-04,31407481,Courtney,"I think the location was good, if you're looking to be in the thick of the town you should look elsewhere. I personally like being on the outskirts of the chaos. This flat was very close to public transit options although my friend and I walked to the Acropolis. The bakery next store makes great coffees and delicious pastries. The value versus the cost was definitely fair and I would recommend to others. You don't visit Athens to stay in your room so it was perfect for our needs."
14034839,193064025,2017-09-12,44903437,Mmabatho,"If you want a ""local"" experience of Athens, then this is the place to be. It's close to a Metro (subway) which is 3 stops away from the main Athens Square. Eirini and Dimitris are super cool, really lovely and hospitable people.  The apartment is clean, contemporary and in a very central place. The fact that there's a coffee bar downstairs is perfect."

The apartment is central, public transport really close, it's the kind of place where you feel like a local even though you are on holiday. The coffee shop downstairs has the best pastries and coffee. There's a supermarket across the road and a metro station not too far from where the apartment is."

The flat was immaculate and the perfect size for us. The bedroom is away from the road which makes it much quieter. They've clearly put a lot of thought into decorating the flat and it has a lovely atmosphere. It's quite a way out of the centre but we needed to be near a clinic so it was very handy for us and it's close to the metro which makes everything very accessible."
14034839,245205609,2018-03-21,7790181,Lance,"The apartment is beautiful, spacious, comfortable, and well equipped. The bed is big and comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed to cook, the bathroom is gorgeous with a great shower. We felt very at home. It's quiet too in the bedroom, which is not always the case next to major roads. We really liked staying here."
14034839,252553136,2018-04-11,2696262,Manuel,"Very close to a big supermarket, walkable to nice restraints (tavernas) and there’s a huge farmer’s market on Saturdays in this area (incredibly affordable and popular). <br/>Host is very friendly and sweet, if you ask something, you’ll always be able to get the right answers. <br/>The room and fabrics are clean, even though the building is along a busy street, bedroom is quiet. <br/>The stove in the kitchen is electric and it’s a tad finicky, but it’s ok for simple cooking.<br/>Everything is there that one needs, maybe bring slippers if you don’t like to wear shoes inside and keep clean."
14034839,258376470,2018-04-29,164921673,Anita,"Thank you Dimitri and Eirini. Your home was clean, comfortable and convenient. Will definitely stay again when next in Athens :)"
14034839,271001151,2018-05-31,62582437,Andrea,"By far the best Airbnb experience we've ever had, everything was exactly as described in the advertisement if not even better.  We stayed for 1 month and from start to finish Dimitri (Irini's husband) was friendly, helpful and hospitable. He went out of his way to help us with Airbnb support on the phone to have our 2nd month refunded because we had to cut our trip short and saved us a good chunk of money.<br/><br/>The apartment itself was great too, we spent a lot of time on the front balcony watching the busy city but fortunately the bedroom is away from the street so you can't hear anything at night. Great air conditioner too!"
14034839,277950603,2018-06-17,194614329,Dimitris,Παρά πολύ καλή επιλογή. Είναι αξιοσημείωτη η διάθεση τους να βοηθήσουν και να εξυπηρετήσουν κατά την άφιξη/αποχώρηση.

The shower was awesome and the bed was nice which was important for me being pregnant during our trip.  Demitri met us late at night to check us in and was there when we left to make sure everything went well.  We had a great time in Athens!

Dimitris welcomed us in and was very polite & friendly. Although the temperatures were low the apartment was warm and the AC helped keep the bedroom warm when the central heating was off. I would recommend this place and stay there again."
14034839,406333903,2019-01-29,51314182,Maria,"The apartment was simply perfect. Nicely furnished and the shower is simply super. The location is very central. The metro is only 5 minutes walk away and you are very fast in the center. Directly down in the house is a nice bakery and opposite a supermarket. Dimitri is just great as a host. He gave us an incredible amount of good tips for sightseeing or a restaurants. I can only recommend the apartment. Even when i had to shorten the vacation, Dimitri was very understanding and helpful. If in Athens, then here."

The owners and are kind, friendly and helpful and responsive to all queries. I came for one month, stayed six. And the bakery downstairs is good - the staff became like friends! It's an easy walk to Kolonaki, Syntagma and Pagkrati too, with easy public transport options available. Also a cheap taxi ride to these areas if your legs give up! Thank you Eirini and Dimitri."

14053253,88195512,2016-07-23,59729648,Vasiliki,"My stay at Vasileios' apartment was just amazing!!!
<br/>I was his first airbnb stay and that was an honour! I didn't have the chance to meet Vasileios because he was away on a business trip and I was greeted by his co-host Panos who was waiting for me at the loft who explained everything in full detail and made me feel immediately like home! 
<br/>A bottle of chilled greek wine was waiting for me at the fridge along with orange juice. That was such a nice welcome! Panos also gave me a map with every spot worth visiting in Athens. 
<br/>The building itself is gorgeous. It's a classy, fully renovated building with an amazing sculpture covering all of it's face! The apartment is on second and top floor of the building and the whole terrace was private for my own use. The terrace is huge and it has everything I wished, from comfortable sunbeds to an outdoor shower that I really loved since it was so warm in Athens during my stay! 
<br/>There is also a stairway outside that leads to a private balcony with a breathtaking view to the Acropolis!!! 
<br/>The apartment itself is brand new and it looks perfect, combining pop culture with great vintage pieces of art. There is even a vinyl record player that I used in the morning to wake up to music! 
<br/>The brand new industrial kitchen is very well equipped along with the bathroom that has a walk-in shower. 
<br/>The apartment has 2 air-condition units so the temperature was perfect throughout my stay. 
<br/>The location was amazing and accurate. It took me 10 minutes walking to get to all the places I wanted to visit, like the Acropolis, the acropolis museum, plaka and the temple of zeus. Just around the corner of the apartment there are a bakery, a cafe and a supermarket. 
<br/>I really hope to return to this wonderful apartment soon and enjoy a glass of wine again with the acropolis on my view! "
14053253,94953940,2016-08-17,3473758,Alexandria,"Loved my stay here - it was a little slice of heaven. Vasileios and his wife greeted us on time and were so kind. Getting settled in was easy! Wine, orange juice, and coffee ready for us when we arrived. The three balconies were perfect for relaxing in the evening time and the views are classic. I was blown away how close this place is to so many places, too! You're only a few blocks from where you want to be - and there is a very close metro stop that can get you down to the water. I think the only reason this place was available (I booked the next day) is because its new to airbnb! I would snag it fast if I was you! I'll stay here again next time I'm in Athens."
14053253,96688419,2016-08-23,39617984,Nathanaelle,"This place is fantastic : well located, clean and got an amazing rooftop! Everything was here to fell you like at home. 
<br/>Vasileios is so nice, he took a lot of his time to give us good addresses, maps to know where to go .. Very good experience at his place for discovering Athens. Highly recommended!!"
14053253,97095890,2016-08-25,6956371,Saraï,Housing is very comfortable and Vasileios was extremely friendly. Air conditioning is very powerful and terraces are pleasant. The view of the Acropolis is fantastic. We watched the sunset on the Parthenon and enjoy a quiet drink . The street is a bit noisy but it's the heart of Athens ... It's like a penthouse furnished with charm. 
14053253,97601983,2016-08-28,1477869,Daniel,"Vasileios was an outstanding host who went above and beyond to make our short stay convenient and enjoyable. He agreed to store our luggage before and after our stay, gave us extra towels for our friends to also shower, arranged taxis for us and our friends, and was easy to reach on his mobile whenever we had a question. The place itself is very comfortable and clean, with a hot shower and fantastic terrace that we had too little time to enjoy (we only stayed 1 night). Highly recommend this place if you want a convenient spot to explore Acropolis and Plaka."
14053253,98691681,2016-09-01,23890687,Eliska,"Our stay exceeded all our expectations, this is absolutely fabolous place!We really loved all the decorations and its really a job well done in terms of interior design, we really felt like at home.The terrace (and view from the upper balcony) is stunning and the apartment has everything you need. Our two year old daughter loved the doll house and spent considerable time playing with it:-D We really loved souvlaki place around the corner that they recommended and there are two more amazing restaurants nearby as well!I hope we will return in the near future.We could not believe that wine,orange juice and water was waiting for us in the fridge, such a lovely gesture that was so appreciated after our tiring journey!"
14053253,98818732,2016-09-02,2306791,Andrea,"A really special flat, exquisitely decorated with a great terrace.
<br/>Vasileios was extremely helpful and flexible with the checking in and out.
<br/>My children loved it.
<br/>Definitely will book again next time I am in Athens."
14053253,99492587,2016-09-05,6827106,Sophia,"My husband and I had a wonderful time at this beautiful nook in athens. The pictures are very accurate- the apartment is tidy, spacious, and bright. The apartment is also decorated with super hip artwork and a fully stocked kitchen. <br/>There is a great supermarket 3 minutes away, and a great souvlaki spot attached to the building! <br/>The description does not adequately express how incredible the rooftop terrace is! Both terraces are completely private and the top one gives you an unmatchable view of the acropolis. It feels like the view is just for you! <br/>I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to be close to the city centre of plaka (5-10 min walk) while still enjoying some privacy. This home felt safe and comfortable. They even arranged for us to be picked up at the airport with someone holding a sign with our names! <br/>Great great spot!!"
14053253,99991053,2016-09-06,6741622,Karine,We have been leaving into Airbnb locations for two months now and this apartment was our favorite. We received plenty of indications and tips from our host. It was clean and the beds were confortable. The terrasse is wonderful. The boys had plenty of fun with the doll house. There's a nice supermarket nearby. I would definitely recommend this apartment to my friend and would come by. It's a 19 euro taxi ride to Piraeus Port.
14053253,100188557,2016-09-07,22760080,Adriana,"Coup de cœur pour cet appartement, bien décoré, très propre et très pratique avec un hôte accueillant et disponible. 
<br/>Pas de doute si vous êtes de passage à Athènes c'est ici qu'il faut aller! "
14053253,101354919,2016-09-12,19415168,Daria,"We stayed in this apartment in September, 2016. It's in fact in the heart of Athens, from where you can easily reach everything you need. We had an amazing time here relaxing on the sunny terrace which has OMG a shower! And there is also another terrace facing the Acropolis, which is very beautiful at night. The apartment itself is very clean and you find there all you need. The host was extremely welcoming - upon arrival we got a bottle of white greek wine, drinking water and juice, also he served us 2 sets of towels for 4 nights. He also showed the apartment and gave necessary info regarding our first steps in Athens. And the last but not least - there is a vinyl records player in the bedroom and we had good time listening to it. So we definitely recommend it! Once in Athens again - we'll stay here!<br/>Мы останавливались в этом апартаменте в сентябре 2016 года. он и в самом деле расположен прямо в центре Афин - отсюда вы легко можете добраться до всего, что вас интересует. мы провели здесь отличные 4 дня, расслабляясь на солнечной террасе с шезлонгами и даже!! душем. Также есть еще одна терраса, с которой открывается вид на Акрополь - невероятно красиво ночью. сам апартамент очень чистый, есть абсолютно все необходимое. Хозяин был очень гостеприимен - по приезду нас ожидала бутылка греческого вина, сока и воды, а также 2 комплекта полотенец на 4 дня! Кроме того, нам предоставили еще пляжные полотенца. Хозяин также показал нам апартамент и дал необходимую информацию касательно наших первых шагов в Афинах. И последнее - в спальне стоит проигрыватель виниловых пластинок, которым мы наслаждались по вечерам. В общем, рекомендуем 100%!! Если будем еще в Афинах, обязательно остановимся здесь!"
14053253,104371419,2016-09-26,17189312,Aurore,"L appartement est géographiquement bien situe pour découvrir le coeur d Athènes. Cependant le quartier est extrêmement bruyant et nous n avons pu profiter de la magnifique terrasse. Au sein du logement, tout était conforme aux photos. La déco est soignée. Nous avons été accueilli chaleureusement par notre hôte qui nous offert un bonne bouteille de vin blanc et des infos très utiles à la découverte de sa ville. Seul bémol...l isolation phonique entre les apparts et le bruit incessant des voitures et moto. Merci à notre hôte pour ce beau séjour. "
14053253,105812846,2016-10-03,56832893,Pierre-Alban,"We had a great stay ! The place is very modern, I enjoyed the nice terrace to have a drink with a view several nights, and the whole apartment is very comfortable for a couple, close to the sights walking, very quick also with cheap taxis and ubers !"
14053253,106409366,2016-10-06,27714281,Panagioti,"The apartment was as described and the host was great. Very easy to contact and the apartment was clean and well appointed. Internet was great and hottie of wine and water in fridge much appreciated. Supermarket and a great little souvlaki shop Judy round the corner. A very easy walk into Plaka, Acropolis and Syntegma "
14053253,107565325,2016-10-11,30079845,Piyush,Vasileios/Panos was a great host<br/>The communication was easy. He also helped us with our luggage on the days we were touring outside athens<br/>All in all a very comfortable stay
14053253,111104424,2016-10-30,4613914,Hilary,Vasileios' flat is lovely. There are 3 fantastic big balconies and you really can see the acropolis from the roof top one. The kitchen is basic but good for breakfasts etc. It's a great little flat with parquet floor in the living room/ bedroom. 
14053253,113856509,2016-11-14,96708715,Bernard,Appartement impeccable et assez central (proche de la station de métro Acropoli). La terrasse est incontestablement le plus mais malheureusement donnant dans une rue assez bruyante. La petite terrasse du dessus avec vue sur le Parthénon nous a ravi pour les petits déjeuners et pour l'apéro le soir.
14060588,224730409,2018-01-04,128509430,Ronak,"I have no Idea how I would wake up tomorrow without that view .... can’t find a view elsewhere , amazing balcony makes it complete ... pictures can’t show half of what you will see , I stayed at Alex’s amazing flat for a month , beside him being amazingggg host , the flat was so comfortable in tiny dimensions ...  it would be The place for max 2people who would like to enjoy amazing Athens and also be able to enjoy the complete view of the city 24/7 ... would love to go back ... thank you Alex , you are amazing"
14060588,245386737,2018-03-22,171794954,Katerina,Loved it from the moment I opened the door. Everything was in place and super clean. The climax of this beautiful apartment was the breathtaking view of lykavitous and the temple of Parthenon over acropolis. Our host Alex was so kind and helped our every need. Thank you for everything!!! I definitely recommend it to all.
14060588,247057531,2018-03-27,150226555,Ileana,"I really enjoyed my stay at Alex‘s place!<br/><br/>The flat is fully-equipped, nicely decorated and has an amazing view of the Athenian skyline from the terrace. It is well-connected to the public transport network as it is located next to a bus stop and the nearest metro station is a 10min-walk away. The neighborhood is quiet and safe and there are shops and supermarkets nearby.<br/>Alex himself is super friendly, reliable and helpful. A great host!<br/><br/>I would definitely come back to that place and I recommend it to everyone who wants to spend some time in central Athens."
14060588,253380877,2018-04-14,127479653,Jack,Alex's place was brilliant! the view is incredible! would recommend to anyone visiting athens!
14060588,253695968,2018-04-15,145951999,Miltos,"Everything was perfect! Alex is a great host. The house was super clean, has minimal design near to everything but the most amazing of all was the view from the balcony. I will visit him again for sure!"
14060588,260833118,2018-05-05,22404325,Sonia,"It really is a room with a view and you will love that rooftop terrace and view of the city! From the Acropolis to the sea (on clear days) and amazing sunsets, that rooftop is the best reason to stay here! <br/><br/>The room itself is modern and well designed, the kitchen is small but has everything you might need in terms of pots and cutlery etc, but you will need to bring everything else (as in salt, pepper, oil, tea etc.). <br/><br/>The studio is on the top floor, without any neighbours, so you will only have the typical street noise and occasional food smell from neighbours further down. It really feels like you are all alone up there, which is a very nice feature in a city where the walls to the neighbours are usually pretty thin.<br/><br/>It also means that it can get pretty warm up there and takes time to cool down during the night, even when you leave the terrace doors wide open. There is an AC of course, I used it only once and did not find it very effective, it mostly brought in fried food smell, but I only tried it that one time very briefly as I really don't like ACs, so I am sure you could make it work, especially if you visit during the summer. <br/><br/>The Wifi is pretty good for Athens, you can sit on the terrace and stream a movie without any problems.  <br/><br/>The neighbourhood is very nice, residential, feels very safe and like a small village. The people are super friendly and will remember you and happily chat with you when you buy your groceries etc. <br/><br/>It is a bit of a walk from the metro (12 minutes or so) but there are buses closer by going to the city centre. Don't fully rely on Goog**map*, they are not up to date and some of the buses indicated there don't exist anymore. It is also a nice walk from the apartment to the city, taking you through some interesting neighbourhoods with plenty of street art and nice cafés etc. <br/><br/>If you come from the metro station, the best way to walk with luggage is to take Leof. Alexandra all the way to Gyzi street, you will avoid some pretty steep hills and stairs :) <br/><br/>Alex is a wonderful host and check-in and -out was very easy and flexible.<br/><br/>All in all: If you are looking for a place with an amazing view to rest and relax, want to stay in a non-touristy area of town that is still pretty easy to get to, I highly recommend this place!"
14060588,261348512,2018-05-06,45011332,Boldizsár,Alex’s apartment is cozy and has a good design. The view from the balcony is also amazing!
14060588,263115452,2018-05-11,80227765,Gergely,"I do not exaggerate when I say that Alex was one of the best host I ever had in my life - amazingly friendly, kind and helpful, ready to help with everything you will need during your stay. His flat is cozy, with a truly amazing view on the city."
14060588,264038204,2018-05-13,97054264,Baylee,I’ve never had to actually book a day in advance and I did with Alex and everything was wonderful and easy! The location is amazing along with beautiful view from the balcony! Will definitely stay again when I come back!
14060588,265707321,2018-05-18,90061978,Steffen,"Alex is a very friendly host who always provides his help. His appartment is quite tiny but the view is incredible especially at night, and the room was very clean."
14060588,266518745,2018-05-20,44993254,Joanna,This place is absolutely fantastic. The terrace is beautiful and is a lovely place to eat breakfast or relax before heading out for the day. We definitely recommend staying here!
14060588,299934139,2018-08-01,31486256,Lydia,The appartment is all that a solo traveler needs - a nice quiet and calm space to come back to after being out in the craziness of Athens. The view is spectacular and is by far the best part of the place. The area is quite nice also though a bit hilly - place is close to busses and metro is not too far either. Alex was very quick to respond to questions and would message to check up on me which was nice. I would stay here if you want to experience a more authentic Athens away from the tourists and in with the locals but still close to the very Centre :) 
14060588,303768249,2018-08-08,44856586,Carole,"A very nice point of view of the city, very peacefull. Alex gave us good advices to visit Athens."
14060588,304801381,2018-08-10,6001670,Elisa,The apartment is perfect for people travelling alone and that want to be out from the crowded touristic places. It is small but has everything you need and of course the view from the roof is amazing! The most important thing is the fast communication with the host! Thanks Alex!
14060588,310983874,2018-08-20,131737018,Elena,"The view from the terrace is really amazing and the apartment is small but really cosy. Alex is a great host, very kind and attentive"

The Check in and Check out was very uncomplicated and I was even  able to Check out later when my plans changed last Minute."
14060588,314681637,2018-08-27,7380882,Antonio,"Our flight was delayed and we arrived late (00:30 a.m.). Despite that, Alex arranged with a friend for the check in and gave us all the necessary information by phone. We could leave our luggage the whole day of the check out. The flat is tiny, but we already knew that. Alex was honest and suggested us to stay in a bigger apartment that he owned (and you can book also in AirB&B). However we wanted to enjoy the stunning view from the terrace and we choose the tiny flat. We where not disappointed: you can see the city at your feet as you are at the 8th floor on a hill. I reccomend Alex for is kindness, honesty an helpfullness."
14060588,316448202,2018-08-31,119890473,Julien,"L'appartement d'Alex est tout simplement magnifique ! <br/>L'appartement est situé au 7eme et dernier étage (avec ascenseur) ce qui nous donne une vue exceptionnelle sur la ville d'Athenes. <br/>L'accueil a été chaleureux et Alex a prit le temps de répondre à chacune de nos questions, je recommande !"

14060588,322874865,2018-09-14,95712967,Sophia,"Wir durften 3 Nächte in Alex seinem Apartmen in Athen verbringen. Die Kommunikation im Vorfeld war sehr einfach und Alex ampfing uns direkt vor der Wohnungstür. Die Wohnung liegt im 8. Stock des Hauses. Ein Fahrstuhl ist vorhanden, dieser fährt zwar nur zum 7. Stock, aber von da aus sind es nur noch wenige Stufen die Treppen hoch. <br/>Die Wohnung ist sehr schön eingerichtet und perfekt wenn man alleine oder zu zweit reist. Vor allem der Balkon mit einem unglaublichen Blick über Athen ist ein echtes Highlight, an das wir uns sicherlich noch lange erinnern werden. Ein Supermarkt befindet sich direkt in der Nähe, sowie ein paar Bushaltestellen & die Metro. <br/>Wir hatten anfangs ein wenig Schwierigkeiten mit dem Schlüssel der Haupteingangstür. Haben aber nach einiger Zeit herausgefunden, dass der Trick ist den Schlüssel nicht ganz ins Schloss zu stecken, dann geht die Tür leicht auf.<br/>Eine sehr empfehlenswerte Unterkunft! Wir waren begeistert."
14060588,323759611,2018-09-16,67054902,Nikki,"Alex was very helpful in arranging our check in, even though we had a late flight. The space was perfect for two people that loved to be out and about exploring, spending minimal time in the apartment (most time on the balcony - because AMAZING views). Great spot with 10 minutes to a near subway line."

Easy to reach from the airport metro line, and about a 45 minute walk to the sights in the Acropolis area. Alex was very fast to respond to any questions, and was great at check-in. There were lots of towels and when the bed was folded out it was really quite large and comfortable. Lovely view from the patio."

I used the metro or taxis, which are not expensive. <br/>The place is small but cosy and clean, and has the essentials (including coffee!).<br/>Alex was very helpful, giving me advice for transportation and things to do in Athens. <br/>I would be happy to stay there again."

The house itself, is exactly as shown in the pictures, a lovely dollhouse - like house, small, Cosy and pretty. Alex is a perfect host, making your stay as easy as possible, always keeping the communication easy and friendly. If you want to stay at a beautiful little house with an amazing view in the center of Athens, this particular house is the perfect choice!"

OMG, you must feel it! Its not possible to describe it. For me as a single person the flat was big enough. Maybe for two person it wouldnt be so comfortable. But anyway, most of the time I didnt spend in the flat. I spent my time by sitting on the terasse or visting the city. Btw, the city central is so close. I always took the walk and not the metro."

14060588,438198821,2019-04-16,247248584,Alisha,"Very comfortable and cozy apartment, close to metro and bus stop with everything necessary around.<br/>Balcony view - definitely the same as from the window of royal suite somewhere in a luxurious hotel:) Alex is happy to welcome every guest personally and provide all the necessary information. Very friendly guy...5* service, isn't it?<br/>It was a great experience - staying in a cute place almost in the heart of Athens and have a feeling of being at home:)"
14060588,440643666,2019-04-21,235658074,Søren,It is a very nice and cosy place and the view is fantastic. Moreover it is not that far away from a metro. Alex is very helpful. Can all in all recommend the place very highly.

14060588,447729077,2019-05-04,461038,Myriam,"I had a great time on the balcony enjoying the amazing view, it is truly spectacular. Alex's place is small but clean, and a nice spot from which to explore the city, although a little far from the Center. <br/>Alex kindly kept my luggage at his café after check-out, which was a kind and appreciated gesture."
14060588,450067520,2019-05-08,72239073,Lily Pei Ling,"Alex was an amazing host and the place is exactly the same as in the pictures if not better. Alex responded to messages promptly and even allowed me to stay later after check out since I carry a lot of luggage. The apartment was clean and the view was a plus. The neighborhood is quiet and I believe to be safe. However, the walk to the metro was a bit long since I am a female traveler going home at night. The distance to the metro was the only thing that would maybe concern some people. Other than that, everything about the apartment was AMAZING and I felt really lucky to have chosen Alex’s place for my Athens trip!"
14060588,452849308,2019-05-14,33316764,Harriet,"This place is perfect for one of two travellers, the view from the terrace is amazing with good location walking distance from downtown Athens, metro stations, restaurants and supermarkets. Would highly recommend!"
14060588,454424147,2019-05-18,234770806,Jeffrey,Alex’s place has this scenic view of the city. Great spot for vloggers who wants to create a motion timelapse of either the sunset or the sunrise. He is always quick to respond to my questions. Easy to communicate.

14060588,502057236,2019-08-04,29778877,Julien,Alex's place is a lovely tiny apartment with such a nice view. It's perfect for couple of days... Visiting and enjoying the view after a long day at night from the balcony<br/>It's 20mins away from the closest train station by walk. Just FYI if you get to Athens from either the airport or Piraeus and you carry lugagges you'll have to take a cab from Victoria Station to the apartment for like 5 euros :)<br/>Alex had always been helpful before and while my stay by answering questions etc... I really appreciated it!<br/>I highly recommend this apartment and would not hesitate to come back there
14060588,505477045,2019-08-09,91735174,Tennessee,"Great location for solo traveler or couples. Only one queen size bed so friends traveling together might want to look elsewhere unless comfortable sharing a bed. <br/><br/>Flat is pretty small but cozy, but the outside covered patio with the incredible view of the city makes up for the size! Was able to sip and enjoy coffee every morning with a nice sweeping view of Athens and. <br/><br/>Bathroom is nice and clean and efficient. <br/><br/>Location is a bit far from bustling parts of Athens, but neighborhood is quiet and felt safe to walk around in at night or by myself as a male. Walk to metro takes about 10-15 min and there isn’t too much in the way of fine dining nearby. But there are a couple cheap simple restaurants within 10 min walking that were nice for quick bites to eat. <br/><br/>Host is very friendly and checks in often to make sure things are okay. Helped answer all my questions timely and kindly. <br/><br/>Not the biggest kitchen to cook / prepare food so wouldn’t recommend trying to prepare anything extravagant for meals at this place. Better keeping it simple for food. <br/><br/>Peaceful and quiet and would definitely stay again if I had the choice"

Alex told he had no time to fix it. If you want to cook i guess it's better to eat outside.<br/>I was searching about the place seriously. I found all the numbers but not 89. Because it's hidden. So please before going check with (Hidden by Airbnb) map..  Because i waist my time asking people there.thank you enjoy your stay"

Whenever I had a question Alex was super quick to respond- I appreciated that so much.  The one downside is that the shower has some trouble draining and there were coffee pods provided but they were not the correct size.  Minor occurrences considering of all the perks in staying here.  Would stay here again without question next time we are in Athens!"
14060588,527970802,2019-09-12,276008630,Matthew,I imagine it would be pretty difficult to find an apartment in Athens at this value with a better view. It is truly incredible and ideal for a solo traveler or couple. Alex is a great host.
14060588,531256112,2019-09-17,271118957,Georgia,"Loved the space, much bigger than the pictures do it justice. <br/>Very tidy and all necessary items were accounted for; powder for the washer, dishwashing stuff etc. <br/><br/>I was staying there on my own and loved being within walking distance to public transport to get into the city."

14060588,536659560,2019-09-27,43637506,Vanessa,The view outside the terrace was breathtaking. It was amazing to see all of Athens from where you are staying. You can see the Acropolis and the sea as well. It was enough space for two. Queen bed was easy to assemble. There is a coffee shop close by that had teas available as well.

14060588,539906505,2019-10-02,40320860,Horst,It is a very tiny and well decorated unit. It has everything someone will need and it can accommodate 2 people comfortably. It has a nice terrace with a spectacular view. The area is very convenient and has everything nearby. You can park on the street for free should you find an available place. The host is kind and readily available to assist.

14060588,544395878,2019-10-10,227640538,David,"Alex provided us with a great stay in Athens. His apartment was perfect for two, as per his efficient use of space. The balcony has an amazing view of Athens, along with a clear view of the Acropolis. It was especially great during the evening, with the setting sun and the glow of the city. Alex kept in touch with us during our stay, making sure everything was good along with answering any questions we had. Thank you Alex! Would highly recommend for travellers looking for a cool spot to stay in Athens."

14060588,572178785,2019-12-02,258098557,Amy,"Great location, great view, and a space that is cozy but not cramped. It's a great location to wind down for a few days, not to mention it is just a block away from Gizi, a strip of bars and cafes. A few expected amenities such as coffee were nowhere to be found, which felt odd because there was a coffee machine available with no coffee to use it with! I also tried to reheat some food, but unfortunately the stove/oven was not working. Other than these minor inconveniences, my stay was without problem."

<br/>Considero buona l'esperienza complessiva."

Le logement est fidèle à la description et suffisant si l'on veut juste visiter Athènes. Il faut prendre les transports en commun ou le taxi  (je conseille uber) pour se rendre sur les principaux sites qui sont à à peine 5 mn en voiture (au mois d'Aout en tous les cas). Cette première expérience est pour moi très concluante et je ne peux que recommander ce logement imbattable au niveau rapport qualité prix. Après 12 jours de camping, le lit confortable fût le bienvenue. Merci encore à Anna et Petros pour leur gentillesse et leur accueil sans pareil, j'aurai plaisir à les revoir, en France ou en Grèce!

Anna contacted me right after booking with a long and detailed message, providing a detailed description about how to get around. She and her husband Petros, welcomed us at the apartment, gave instruction to everything, helped us plan our next day and we even got little gifts. The flat is nice and cozy, it is exactly as you see it on the pictures. It was all ours, we could use everything even a washing machine if we wanted to. The location is very appealing, it is close to the metro and many buses to the center - it is really easy to get around. There is a two story supermarket just on one corner and a fast-food place with delicious pitas on the other - both 1 minute from the house. It is highly recommended for every couple who visit Athens.

Anna was also kind to leave fresh pastry and cheese for breakfast And she was very kind to allow us to check in early.  
<br/>Anna and Petros were very kind to invite us to have a traditional Greek dinner with them. I felt like part of family in a city I just arrived to. "

Communication with Anna was fast and easy throughout, the place is exactly as announced in a convenient part of town, and very comfortable for two. Anna waited for us to arrive with a bottle of wine, beautiful gifts, Greek sweets and our new favorite cake: portokalopita. When we mentioned how much we had enjoyed it, she even brought some more! That shows exactly the kind of host Anna is. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to everyone and will be back whenever in Athens. Thank you, Anna."

14060811,111968308,2016-11-03,95745022,Patrick,"Die Unterkunft war super und Anna hat uns wahnsinnig herzlich empfangen (Kuchen und Lasagne inklusive). Die Wohnung ist mit allem ausgestattet, was man für sein tägliches Leben benötigt und selbst der Kühlschrank enthält ein paar Kleinigkeiten. Die Anbindung ins Zentrum ist ebenfalls super. Lediglich der Blick vom Balkon, auf die gegenüberliegende Häuserfront ist ein kleiner Minuspunkt. Da wir aber eh den ganzen Tag unterwegs waren und meist erst abends zurückkamen, war das ziemlich egal. 
<br/>Fazit: Schönes kleines Appartement in einer ruhigen Nachbarschaft mit einer unglaublich netten Gastgeberin. Danke Anna, wir kommen gerne wieder:)

She told us of the best parts of town to visit and how to use the public transportation. Her apartment is very close to public transportation and is only a 15-20 minute ride to the area with all the monuments.

<br/>Grâce à eux notre séjour s'est trouvé être ""merveilleux""... quelle gentillesse, quel accueil... nous ne le dirons pas assez.
<br/>Le tout près de la place Syntagma et de la rue Ermou... c'est à dire en plein centre à 20 minutes à pied."
14060811,125502246,2017-01-06,98616208,Diviyah,"We had a good time at Anna's place. She greeted us with some Greek delicacies, a bottle of wine and some Greek souvenirs. The flat was cozy and accurate as per description. Easy access to the center even by foot. The only issue we had was with the hot water in the shower. We were unable to use more than one appliance at one time (washing machine, heater, water heater in the shower) as it caused power outage multiple times. Petros was very kind to come over to have a look at the problem but we continued facing this problem the next day. We just adjusted to it by switching off the room heater when we needed to shower. Otherwise, this is a great place to stay. Anna and her husband were amazing as well!   "
14060811,126244067,2017-01-10,43499510,Mohamed,"Thank you very much Petros and Anna for this great experience we had in Athina. At our arrival Petros came for us and guide us to the apartment. The apartment is 15 min far from syntagma square in transport public more or less. The apartment is warm and Anna and Petros showed us all the things we needed to have a good stay in the apartment and also advised us about buses, things to do in Athens... Thanks for the presents you let us in the apartment and also for the typical food you left us in the kitchen. I RECOMMEND 200% THIS APARTMENT!

Anna even gave us some of her homemade Greek yoghurt cake with citrus syrup and a bottle of wine, we were so overwhelmed by her kindness! When we arrived very late at night and got a little bit lost, her husband even went out on the street to look for us and to make sure that we arrived safely. They stayed up very late just for our arrival. They also gave us very very detailed guides to Athens and how to get to the bus stop, where to find food. They even helped us find out how to get to the airport when we were leaving early in the morning! For every need, Anna is there for you. Terrific experience, 101% will recommend! "

She is really hospitable and made some baklava and borek for us, with a nice red wine, which we loved. :) The house's location is really nice. If you are fine with walking you will easily walk around the city from house. There's a market that you can buy anything very close to house. The only thing that may bother some people is that the room has only one window and since it is at the first floor it doesn't get too many natural light, it wasn't a problem for us though. :) <br/>I highly recommend this house, if we go to Athens again, I will definetely check Anna's place first ^^ "

Anna's husband was very welcoming, gave us all the information needed and even had a some Greek treats to great us! The flat is cozy and very well equipped, we didn't feel like anything was missing.

They welcomed us with a bottle of wine, two pieces of cake and two little gifts for us. They also explained in detail how to get around the city, how to reach the common places of interest and also suggested vegetarian restaurants for us to eat. This is an amazing place to stay at during your visit in Athens, and it's close to the city centre too. Recommended! 5+ stars!!!"

They gave us a lot of advice and help for our stay bad prepared the apartment just lovely. I would recommend the apartment to friends and family. <br/>The location is good. Directly at the metro and bus station and if you good by food you can walk to the city (we never used public transportation) <br/><br/>Anna und ihr Mann sind wunderbare Gastgeber. Das apartment war sauber und hatte alles was man braucht. Zu Fuß erreicht man das Zentrum von Athen in 30 Minuten oder man nimmt den bus. <br/>Anna hat uns viele Tipps gegeben bezüglich Restaurants etc. und wir waren begeistert. Wir würden es an Freude und Familie weiter empfehlen 
14060811,132468128,2017-02-18,46604540,Elisa,"Wir waren als Pärchen 4 Nächte in Annas Unterkunft und hatten einen tollen Urlaub in Athen! Anna ist die beste Airbnb Vermieterin die wir jemals hatten- sie gab uns Informationen über die Anreise, erwartete uns mit Geschenken, selbstgemachtem Kuchen, einem halbvollen Kühlschrank, war immer ereichbar, sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und informierte uns während des Aufenthalts immer über aktuelle Ausfälle von Bussen oder Ubahn Linien.  Die Wohnung war perfekt für unsere Zwecke- sie ist sehr zentral gelegen (wir haben alles zu Fuß besichtigt, aber es gab auch einen Bus direkt in die Stadt), gemütlich, hat eine voll ausgestatte Küche wo wir jeden Tag gefrühstückt haben, ein Bad mit Badewanne und Handtüchern und ein Schlafzimmer mit bequemen Bett und kleinem Balkon. Falls wir nochmals nach Athen fahren, würden wir auf jeden Fall wieder hier bleiben! <br/>Für alle Athen Besucher können wir einen Tagestrip zum Tempel des Poseidon im Kap Sounion empfehlen- es gibt einen öffentlichen Bus dorthin und die Reise lohnt sich! :)"

Hneď od začiatku som bola veľmi prekvapená, keď už pri rezervácii mi Anna poskytla všetky detaily v naozaj dlhom maily.<br/>Nanešťastie, náš let mal 5 a pol hodinové meškanie. Dorazili sme o 23.30 úplne hladné a vyčerpané bez akejkoľvek predstavy, kde zoženieme jedlo o takej hodine! Annin manžel, Petros nás čakal v byte do noci, kým sme neprišli. Všetko nám vysvetlil, ukázal byt, odpovedal na otázky, zorientoval v základných veciach ako doprava, pamiatky, otváracie hodiny, (Website hidden by Airbnb) naše prekvapenie, Anna pre nás pripravila skvelý koláč, čakala nás fľaša vína a jedlo v chladničke na raňajky.<br/>Celkovo sme sa cítili výborne, byt pôsobil veľmi domáckym dojmom - útulný a príjemný, že sme vrelo vítané. Okrem toho, je skvelo vybavený (kuchynský riad, práčka, hygienické potreby, uteráky navyše, lekarnička...) a posteľ je veľmi pohodlná (tiež vankúše a perina navyše). K okoliu bytu sa vyjadrovať nebudem, prešli sme celé centrum a všade to vyzerá rovnako (maľby na stenách a tak), celkovo sme sa však cítili bezpečne takže neriešim.<br/>Annu, ako hostiteľa, jednoznačne odporúčam, myslím že pri porovnaní cena vs. Kvalita sme boli vo viac ako 5* hoteli.<br/><br/>Me and my friend spent in flat 3 nights. Staying on Anna's place was amazing! I have been surprised straight away on beginning when she provided me all details in REALLY long mail. Unfortunately, our plane had delay 5 and half hour, we came 11.30 pm but her husband Petros has been waiting for us! We have been completely exhausted with no food and didn't expect where we buy something to eat. After coming Petros showed us everything, explained basic things about city, answered for all our question and Anna prepared amazing tasty cake. We couldn't believe it! Also bottle of wine and some food for breakfast have been in fridge! <br/>We felt like at home - cosy and warm, really welcomed . Except that, apartment was really perfect equipped and bed was comfortable. <br/>I am not going to say about neighbourhood cause we were walking around all Athens and it was same everywhere (spray paintings on walls etc.)but we felt safety there.<br/>I highly recommend Anna as a host, I wish to everywhere find so great people like her :)"
14060811,134441518,2017-02-27,26409983,Jeremy Kyle,"Anna and Petros offered an ideal apartment for 1-2 people. Clean, comfortable, and well equipped to handle all your needs.

Justo después de confirmar la reserva Anna me envió toda la información detallada sobre el alojamiento, transporte e incluso links con información turística e incluso el día de nuestra salida nos orientó sobre cómo llegar al aeropuerto y las horas especificas en que salía el metro. <br/>A nuestra llegada, nos recibió su esposo Petros. El fue increíblemente amable, incluso tomando en consideración que eran pasadas las 11 pm. Nos mostró el apartamento, nos brindó información adicional de transporte, turismo y aclaró todas nuestras dudas. Además, al entrar a la cocina, Anna nos había preparado un delicioso pastel tradicional con una botella de vino y unos hermosos recuerdos de Grecia. <br/>En referencia a la ubicación, se pueden encontrar cerca paradas de autobús y la estación del metro Ambelokipi se encuentra a 15 minutos caminando. También está muy cerca la avenida Leof Alexandras, donde se pueden encontrar varios restaurantes, panaderías y cafeterías. <br/>Gracias Anna y Petros por la grandiosa experiencia. Si regresamos a Atenas sin duda nos hospedaríamos en su apartamento.  "

From before my arrival until my departure, they provided me with all the info I could possibly need about the city of Athens. The apartment was conveniently located in a quiet area, very close to all means of transport and making you able to walk to the city center. I would never forget that warm welcome with an orange cake made by Anna. Highly recommended, thanks again for everything."

(There was a problem with the internet dropping, but it was not Anna's fault.  It was a problem with the internet provider.)  Even though we had this problem, Anna had a ""plan B.""  We recommend this apartment highly!  She also made a Greek orange cake desert for us that was waiting on arrival.  It was delicious!"

La atención de Anna es para valorar por sobre todas las cosas: nos esperó con un vino, porciones de torta, un regalo para cada uno, jugos, fideos, mermeladas,  todos los elementos de higiene nuevos! Si volviera a Atenas, no dudaría en volver a este alojamiento: 100% recomendable!"

The apartment was excellent, in a superb location (only about a 20 minute brisk walk from the Acropolis) and Anna's communication was above and beyond. She not only helped us find our way around Athens but researched and figured out what bus we would need to take to get to our next destination as well. Two thumbs way, way up! "

Ils sont très gentils et prennent le temps pour tout nous expliquer et même nous donner des endroits où aller ou encore les horaires et arrêts de tram/bus etc.. Des hôtes très attentionnés et très agréables. Nous recommandons les yeux fermés. De plus le logement et bien placé, il est facile d'accès depuis l'aéroport (et Anna vous explique tout pour le métro) aussi, nous avons tout fait à pied pour visiter le centre etc. C'est très propre et tout est là (serviettes de bains, dentifrice, shampoing, thé, café ...) <br/>Bon séjour!"

Wygada tak jak na zdjeciach - czyste i zadbane. W mieszkaniu znajduja sie wszytkie potrzebne urzadzenia, a takze inne niezbedne rzeczy (reczniki, kosmetyki, podstawowe produkty spozywcze). Mieszkanie posiada maly balkonik, ktory umila porani i wieczory. Ponadto, Anna i Petros to niesamowici ludzie - serdeczni, pomocni i niesamowicie zyczliwi oraz bardzo elastyczni. Przywitali nas greckimi smakolykami oraz dobrym winem. Wskazali najciekawsze miejsca do odwiedzenia (lacznie z oznaczeniem na mapie) w Atenach i okolicy, polecili dobre restauracje oraz inne atrakcje.

This included on places to go and eat as well as showing us where everything was on the map.<br/>Conveniently she is also a fluent French speaker which helped as my wife is Belgian. She also greeted us with gifts, a bottle of wine and a delicious cake which we enjoyed. On our third day in Athens she also dropped off some very tasty Greek-style pies.<br/>The apartment provided us with all our needs, and was fairly close to the National Archaeological Museum too. From the apartment we were also close to public transport to take us to the heart of the city.<br/>Overall wonderful host, great value for money and thoroughly recommended."

Die Kommunikation für Check-in-/out war sehr unkompliziert und flexibel, was perfekt war für unseren Aufenthalt und die noch nicht ganz ausgeplante Weiterreise nach Rhodos mit der Fähre. <br/>Auch die Lage des netten voll ausgestatteten Apartments (ideal und völlig ausreichend für 2) ist angenehm dank guter Anbindung ins centrum (Busse/Metro). Es befinden sich einige hübsche kleine Bars und Restaurants direkt um die Ecke, wo man auch Einheimische antrifft. Dank air condition war es fast schon eine Oase zurück in die Wohnung zu kommen, da es gerade 40*C in Athen waren. Alles in allem ist zu sagen: ideale Wohnung für 1-2 Personen in angenehmer Lage, ausgestattet mit allem was man braucht und als i-Tüpfelchen mit einer wunderbaren Gastgeberin. Jederzeit wieder!

14060811,174188367,2017-07-25,74568098,Frederik,"Anna and Pedro were wonderful hosts. The apartment was very nice and clean, and you can get easily from there to Athens city center with the bus. We arrived late in night, but nevertheless Anna and Pedro welcomed us so friendly and even the fridge was full of essentials for our breakfast.<br/>I can recommend this apartment and when I come back to Athens, I will book this apartment again!"
14060811,176872684,2017-08-01,107387186,Shelley,She was a fantastic host. She gave us ideas on where to go and how to get there. She brought us some authentic Greek food as well as a souvenir. I highly recommend this place to all.
14060811,179624360,2017-08-08,51507403,Cara,"My boyfriend and I stayed for a week at Anna's apartment in Athens and had the best time. The suite itself is located in a great part of town and within walking distance to cool local bars, cafes restaurants and shops as well as attractions such as the Acropolis. It is a lovely apartment stocked with nearly anything you might need -- lots of clean towels, a small kitchen (Anna even left some yogurt and coffee and other goodies), and A/C (a blessing in the crazy August heat!). Although it was very private, the best part about it was the hospitality. We arrived at the apartment after midnight because of a late flight, and Anna and her husband were there to greet us with pastries and wine and lots of tips and suggestions for getting around the city despite the late hour! They helped us to navigate our way to one of the islands (Aegina) and to the beach and let us store our bags at their home during our last day after check out. All in all one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had and definitely recommended!"

Mēs ieradāmies agri no rīta, un Anna ar vīru uzaicināja mūs ciemos uz ledus kafiju ar sviestmaizēm, kā arī atļāva palikt viņu otrā dzīvoklī, kamēr mūsu dzīvoklis atbrīvojās. Dzīvoklis ir tuvu pieturām visur ir viegli nokļūt. Pašā dzīvoklī pieejams viss nepieciešamais ēst gatavošanai, dušai utt. Esam sajūsmā, Anna un viņas vīrs bija lieliski :)<br/><br/>Thank you so much for everything, your friendly and welcoming attitude makes you a true superhosts :) <br/>Ramona&Anders"

Hatta daha da ileri gidip, ilk gün akşam vardığımız için dolaba yiyecek/içecek bile koymuşlar:) Bu güzel çifti tanıştığımız için çok mutluyuz. Evin yeri ise şehir merkezine yakın ve ulaşım oldukça rahat. Atina'yı ziyaret eden herkese tavsiye ederiz.<br/><br/>We are so happy to meet Anna&Petros couple. They supplied us more than the basic necessities that we needed, including a full fridge because of our late check-in :) This nice couple is very responsive and hospitable about everything you may need in Athens. Their flat is easily reachable by public transport and you feel yourself like in your house. Would recommend to everyone who wants to visit Athens :)"

Anna e seu marido são pessoas muito boas e providenciam tudo que o hóspede precisa, até mesmo comida e presentes (o que eles não precisam ter fornecido, muito obrigado). Um ótimo preço pelo que eles forneceram para gente. Recomendo e ficaria lá novamente com certeza.<br/><br/>The apartment is very good and confortable. The intenet is great.

Min kæreste og jeg checkede ind sent om aftenen, men Anna og hendes mand, Petros, ventede tålmodigt på os og bød os velkommen med en grundig gennemgang af lejligheden samt gaver, vin og kage. Vi kunne ikke have følt os mere velkomne. Lejligheden havde alt man skulle bruge og var ren og rydelig. Beliggenheden var perfekt, tæt på Exarchia og Mount Lycabettus, og med et supermarked lige nede af gaden. Hermed de varmeste anbefalinger."

L'appartamento è ben fornito, c'è tutto l'occorrente per la colazione e per il pranzo (come pasta, uova..), sono disponibili prodotti da bagno, salviette, lenzuola, insomma tutto il necessario. Anna ci ha lasciato anche un regalo e un dolce appena arrivate. Soggiorno ottimo, molto consigliato!!!"
14060811,198318451,2017-09-29,117707981,Madison,Anna and Petros are the best hosts you could ask for. They're so flexible for your arrival and departure times. They even left us Greek treats upon arrival. The apartment has everything you could ever need for your time in Athens!

Das Apartment hat eine super Grundausstattung, Öl, Salz, Gewürze, Tee, Kaffee und sogar Shampoo und Seife standen zur Benutzung zur Verfügung. Außerdem war Anna und ihrem Mann sehr daran gelegen, uns mit allen nützlichen und wichtigen Informationen auszustatten. Beim Auschecken konnten wir sogar unser Gepäck in der Wohnung lassen und so noch einmal Athen genießen, bevor es zum Flughafen ging. Vielen Dank Anna für so viel Gastfreundschaft!"
14060811,201270088,2017-10-08,108805440,Jackie,Great apartment. Anna has thought of everything you may require and is a lovely host. Some street noise but nothing major. Stayed 4 nights. Highly recommended. We felt at home here.

She gave Very good hints about the city, gave ALL the support with the appartment and surprises us with lote of comodities that made our stay much more easy and confortable. Amazing. When I come back to Athina for sure Ana's Will be there place."
14060811,204266575,2017-10-17,38459843,Giovanna,"Anna e Petros sono stati gentili e precisi con noi fin da subito! Ancora prima della partenza ci hanno inviato tutte le informazioni necessarie per il nostro soggiorno, in particolare per come raggiungere l'appartamento. I loro consigli sono stati molto preziosi. Una volta arrivati in appartamento ci hanno accolti con dolci tipici, una bottiglia di vino e due fantastici souvenir! L'appartamento è molto accogliente e ben organizzato. Peccato per la distanza dalla fermata metro più vicina (1 km), anche se c'è la possibilità di raggiungerla con mezzi pubblici abbastanza efficienti. Nel complesso consigliamo a tutti di soggiornare qui per rendere ancora più magico il vostro viaggio ad Atene!"
14060811,204831653,2017-10-20,101105179,Christine,"Anna is a wonderful host. The apartment was clean, and Anna had some local treats and gifts waiting for us on our arrival. Her communication was super clear and it was very easy to find her place. The fridge was stocked with breakfast food when we arrived, and there were toiletries in the bathroom for us to use.  She swung by the next day to leave some fresh pides for us while we were out sightseeing. She had a plethora of guides and brochures and recommendations to help us make the most out of our two nights in the city. She was the greatest host we’ve had. It was very easy to find her place and get to it from the airport via metro. If you want to feel at home in the city, stay with Anna. Loved our stay so much (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
14060811,206359117,2017-10-25,80216839,Diana,"Uno de los mejores anfitriones que tenido. Anna y Petros han sido muy hospitalarios, recomendandonos restaurantes y sitios turísticos que hay que ver. También a nosotras nos dieron la bienvenida con un vino griego y la famosa pita de Anna. No sin antes, otro día, tambien nos dejaron en la puerta más pitas que ella había hecho. Muy ricas! Aunque la ubicación no es central con el bus llegas en 10-15 min y andando 25-30min al centro y 15min andando del metro. Lo recomendamos 100% si lo que quieres es no estar en pleno centro turístico y conocer más la vida griega. No recomiendo estar en el piso con bebés o niños ya que por las noches y sobre todo por el  día tiende a ser  ruidoso ya que es un primer piso-bajo. Gracias Anna y Petros!"
14060811,206780757,2017-10-27,143800440,David,"This apartment is on the busline to downtown, but it's also walkable if needed and the buses are full. The apartment is very well stocked, and has lots of local information printed off and available for food, and attractions. Good internet connection available, and lots of power for charging devices. Anna is very nice and super helpful."
14060811,207912788,2017-10-30,43899395,Adrienne,"While not in the centre of town, this apartment is still in a decent location and is easily accessible to town by bus and metro, or it's about a half hour to forty five minute walk. The apartment was clean and well appointed, and Anna was an absolutely fantastic host. Great wifi, comfortable bed and all the amenities you need, I would definitely stay here again if I ever find myself in Athens."
14060811,208833695,2017-11-03,43668457,Melina,"L'appartement est parfait pour un petit séjour en Grèce ! Toutes les visites peuvent se faire à pied pour ceux qui aiment se balader (40 minutes de l'acropole), et pour les autres entre bus et métro c'est bien desservi. Anna est très conviviale, elle apporte beaucoup à ses hôtes, nous avons été ravis !! De plus tout est fourni ! Serviette, drap, savon, papier toilette ... il y a même le dentifrice, c'est très complet. Anna conseille des restaurants pour aller manger, ou des endroits à visiter. Très bonne adresse !"
14060811,209431796,2017-11-05,65481475,Tyler,"The place was great, convenient and comfortable.  By far the most generous hosts we've had, left us local treats, souvenirs and even a bottle of wine!  On top of that, they also gave us the option of not checking out till 4pm!  Really awesome folks, I highly recommend their place :)"
14060811,210229002,2017-11-08,99369339,Demare,What a great way to start our honeymoon in Greece! Excellent restaurant suggestions and excellent directions to public transit options. The house was clean and the bed was comfortable. Anna greeted us with wine and sweets — it was amazing!

Anna et Pierre sont des hôtes rares et leur logement comporte tout ce dont on peut avoir besoin. <br/>Nous recommandons chaudement, merci Anna & Pierre, vous avez rendu notre séjour encore plus inoubliable."
14060811,212323222,2017-11-17,121398052,Zun,"Die Unterkunft war sehr sauber und mit allem ausgestattet, was man für den Alltag benötigt. Die Anbindung durch Busse und U-Bahn ermöglicht es innerhalb von 35 min an der Akropolis zu sein und auch die Fahrt zum Flughafen mit der M3 ist kaum einfacher zu bewerkstelligen. <br/>Das wahre Highlight ist weniger die Unterkunft an sich als vielmehr die perfekte Gastgeberin. Anna war uns die zuverlässigste Wettervorhersage, Krisenmelder (sie informierte uns am Tag zuvor, warum plötzlich die Metros nicht mehr fuhren oder dass wir bestimmte Gegenden Athens aufgrund der 1973 Gedenkdemonstrationen meiden sollten), Restaurantempfehler und gute Fee in einer Person. Die Wohnung mag nicht absolut im Zentrum Athens liegen, aber wir können absolut sicheren Gewissens Anna und ihre Unterkunft an jeden weiter empfehlen, dessen Budget etwas kleiner ausgefallen ist. Annas Tipps und Infos hingegen sind unbezahlbar und ein wahrer Segen für Erstbesucher Athens!"
14060811,213228665,2017-11-20,32058771,Catherine,"Anna and Petros are exceptional hosts.  They went above and beyond our expectations.  We arrived on a day when there was a peaceful demonstration taking place, therefore affecting public transport.  Petros met us at the metro and walked us to the apartment (about a 20min walk) which really helped us as we had never been to Athens before.  We had Greek pastries, a bottle of wine, gifts and lots of extras that we didn't expect.  The apartment is very homely and has lots of personal touches.  Great value for money and lovely hosts.  Definitely recommend..."
14060811,213988291,2017-11-24,73981689,Joan,"Our stay was more than perfect! Anna's directions were spot on on how to get to the apartment & she even let us know about some travel delays ahead of time. Her responsiveness to our messages & the detail she gave to help us was so appreciated. Anna met us there to welcome us & walk us through everything we could need to know. The apartment was great- we fell in love with the neighborhood & felt very at ease. The apartment itself met or exceeded all of our needs & we were very comfortable. Having a small kitchen was very helpful & there is a grocery store 1/2 block away. We found the bed comfy, there was thermometer control & we were very well accommodated. We spent most of our time walking nearby. Lycabettus Hill is a moderate walk away & is well worth your time to see the city! We would absolutely stay here again!"

De todas maneras a 20 metros hay un supermercado muy completo. En la zona del piso, hay restaurantes, panaderias, un parque cerca donde fuimos a correr etc. Esta ubicado a 40 minutos caminando al centro de Atenas, es un paseo, pero hay  un bus, creo que el 230 que pasa muy cerca y te lleva al centro, metro a unos 15 minutos caminando.<br/>Cuando viajo y reservo por airbnb, lo primero que leo son las evaluaciones, y este piso tiene muchas y muy buenas.<br/>Lo recomiendo ya que la relacion calidad precio es muy buena."

Η φιλοξενία της Άννας ήταν φανταστική και μας βοήθησε σε ο,τι χρειαστήκαμε! Είχαμε εξαιρετική διαμονή και σίγουρα θα επιστρέψουμε στο μέλλον!!! Προτείνεται ανεπιφύλακτα! Ευχαριστούμε και πάλι Άννα!"

She left amazing Christmas sweets she made herself which were wonderful. The place was very neat and organised, and it felt like a home away from home honestly. Very convenient supermarket just around the corner, and a while's walk away from the city center really took the cake for me. I absolutely loved it."

El alojamiento cumple con más de lo que uno podría esperar y es un lugar muy cómodo para dos personas y es fácil de llegar. Fuimos recibidos con galletas y vino y nos regalaron un par de obsequios. Siempre estuvieron atentos a lo que necesitabamos y a darnos respuesta inmediata cuando teníamos alguna duda. Nos siguieron los mejores lugares para visitar y comer. Este es un lugar que sin duda recomendaría.

Anna and Petros kept us up to date with all the information we could ever want to know about Athens, local restaurants as well as transport to and from the airport and when there was unfortunately a strike while we were there they made sure we knew exactly what was going on. The city centre is easily reached by public transport or Uber if you don’t like to walk however we enjoy walking and it can be done in half an hour. Overall we had a great time and would 100% recommend for anyone to stay here :)"
14060811,227799423,2018-01-16,17666958,Martí,Anna y Petro son muy atentos.

It was nicely located close enough to public transit, restaurants, and shopping but far enough away from the “tourist” down sides we saw as we passed through. <br/><br/>Anna was an amazing hostess with attention to detail. She made us feel like family from her first email. She was extremely prompt with every email and her directions were very detailed. We will definitely use this location again with our next trip to Athens."
14060811,229397426,2018-01-23,87230639,Leticia,Anna y Petros son unos anfitriones excelentes. En el apartamento hay todo lo necesario. La cama y las almohadas son muy cómodas. Si bien no está en la zona céntrica se puede llegar fácilmente usando el metro a todos los sitios de interés en pocos minutos. El apartamento está muy prolijo e impecable la limpieza. Los anfitriones son un amor! A pesar de que mi inglés es muy limitado hicieron todo lo posible por ayudarme y entendernos. Si vuelvo a Atenas no dudaré en alojarme nuevamente allí . Gracias Anna y Petros !

14060811,232763346,2018-02-06,130396754,Bryony,This was a great place to stay for my three night trip to Athens. Anna and her husband were there to welcome us and provided lots of very useful local knowledge and instructions for everything around the apartment. Anna went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant. The apartment has all the toiletries you could need and is stocked with basic food too. Easy distance to public transport to all the main sites. Brilliant host!
14060811,234314914,2018-02-12,17163152,Christine,"Anna war eine grossartige Gastgeberin. Sie hat im Vorfeld immer schnell geantwortet und die Kommunikation war kein Problem. Vor Ort hat sie mir Infos zu den Regionen gegeben und mich mit leckeren Spezialitäten aus Athen begrüsst. Die Wohnung ist perfekt für eine Städtereise in Athen für Alleinreisende oder zu Zweit. Sie ist total gemütlich eingerichtet und es ist alles da, was man brauchen könnte. Ich kann die Übernachtung bei Anna uneingeschränkt empfehlen würde jederzeit wieder Gast bei Anna sein wollen :)"

Nos informaron mucho acerca de la ciudad y cualqier duda que pudiérmos tener. El piso estaba limpio y totalmente equipado. Además esta muy bien situado. 100% recomendable! <br/><br/>Our stay and  experience  with Anna and Petros have been great! Both of them are really warm, helpul and attentive to detail. They informed us about the city and any doubt we had. The flat was clean and  completely equipped as well as conveniently allocated,  100% recommendable!"
14060811,236393798,2018-02-19,22558052,Prasana,"It’s an amazing place to stay and I enjoyed all my 2 days/3 nights in Athens. Petros, Anna’s husband, was at the apartment to welcome me very early morning as I landed midnight from London. This arrangement was pre-agreed and Petros handled it in the best way. He was not only up till the early morning but also provided great insights about Athens and details instructions for everything around the apartment and to/from airport. <br/><br/>In addition, Petros and Anna provided me surprise welcome pack of free wine bottle and the best Greek sweet. They are the best hosts in my experience so far with AirBnB. As mentioned in all previous reviews, they went above and beyond to make my stay pleasant. The apartment has all the toiletries and kitchen items one need and is stocked with basic food too. Highly recommend. Brilliant host!"

14060811,237476188,2018-02-23,66606063,Noelle,"We really enjoyed our short stay in Anna’s apartment. She left wine and oranges and delicious yogurt for us to enjoy. We took the walk she recommended on our first evening in Athens and got a gorgeous overlook of the whole city, plus we got to watch the Acropolis light up after sunset. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. <br/><br/>Just note, you probably want to turn on the hot water about half an hour before you shower. I started it ten minutes before and ran out. But after I knew, it wasn’t a problem. This apartment is really well stocked."
14060811,238591533,2018-02-26,164330507,Beatrice,"L'appartamento è piccolo ma confortevolissimo. La posizione è comoda, il centro è raggiungibile in 30 minuti a piedi, che per alcuni potrebbero essere molti, ma durante la camminata si possono vedere altri quartieri e stradine molto belli. Anna è una persona fantastica, super accogliente e disponibile. La casa è attrezzatissima e c'è davvero tutto quello di cui uno può aver bisogno. <br/>Io personalmente mi sono trovata molto bene, la casa era pulitissima e l'unica sua pecca è che essendo a un piano basso è poco luminosa, ma questi sono dettagli abbastanza inutili per chi viaggia e alloggia per qualche giorno. Per non parlare del prezzo, super onesto! <br/>Quindi, in conclusione, vi consiglio vivamente di affidarvi ad Anna, non ve ne pentirete!!"
14060811,239515957,2018-03-02,94214550,Reinaldo,"Excelente! Não sei se poderia ter sido melhor. Anna honra plenamente a tradição da hospitalidade grega: minha esposa e eu nos sentimos como deuses...rsrs<br/>Se voltarmos à Atenas, certamente tentaremos ficar novamente hospedados na casa de Anna."
14060811,240579314,2018-03-05,42589227,Nicole,"We had a great time at Anna's place. Anna and her husband greeted us with a bottle of wine & baklava and spent time with us to go over the map of Athens and how to get around. Anna has everything you need to feel like you are home (from coffee filters, to a hairdryer and iron).  Thanks so much for everything!"
14060811,241021015,2018-03-07,161464571,晓曦,"这个公寓非常好,房东也很热情,她告诉了我们很多有用的信息,她推荐的餐厅都非常好"
14060811,244102540,2018-03-18,146770522,Pedro,"Al menos en español, la palabra ""anfitrión"" proviene del griego y, de hecho, Anna y Petros hacen honor con creces a dicho origen. El apartamento totalmente a la altura de las expectativas, con todo lo necesario y más, bien comunicado con los puntos más interesantes de la ciudad en autobús o metro, y accesible caminando allá donde no llega el transporte público (p.ej, colina Lycabetus). La implicación de Anna y Petros para facilitar mi llegada y hacerme más cómoda e interesante la estancia ha sido total y la bienvenida muy, pero muy especial. En definitiva, mi valoración es únicamente  de 5 estrellas por que la aplicación no me permite dar más. De hecho, si vuelvo a Atenas, ésta será mi primer opción."
14060811,244953668,2018-03-20,175298995,Emely,"Das Apartment ist sehr gut gelegen und alle Sehenswürdigkeiten sind gut mit dem Bus und zu Fuß erreichbar.

14060811,249950870,2018-04-03,1427952,Tomas,"Perfekte Unterkunft für einen Kurztrip nach Athen. Man erreicht die Wohnung vom Flughafen aus in weniger als einer Stunde. Zu Fuß kommt man in 45 Minuten zur Akropolis und zu allen anderen Sehenswürdigkeiten, aber es gibt gleich um die Ecke auch eine Bushaltestelle, die alles noch kürzer macht. Angenehm ruhiges Wohnviertel am Fuße des Lycabettus Berg. Gut funktionierende Dusche und Bad, perfekt ausgestattete Küche, volle Kühlschrank mit Wein, Feta und Oliven von den Gastgebern."

She welcomed us with a bottle of wine, souvenirs and some greek sweets. Very quick responding. The apartment is very nice and clean, with everything that you need available. The area feels very safe with a local feeling. Nearby bus stop which take you to the main attractions in around 25 mins. If I come back to Athens, I would not look anywhere else. Anna is the real Superhost!"

She goes far beyond anything we have experienced to make sure your stay in Athens is easy and enjoyable. She met us at the apartment and went through every detail with us about the place as well as the surrounding area until we were completely comfortable and confident. She has supplied everything you could ever need and thoughtfully added special touches like freshly baked Greek pastries and a beautiful bottle of red wine. She even turned up one day and brought us a traditional home cooked Greek dinner. Amazing! We would definitely stay in Anna’s apartment again and highly recommended it."
14060811,259468495,2018-05-01,51124815,Patricia,on se sent comme à la maison avec des attentions particulières comme le frigo rempli pour pouvoir manger dès notre arrivée.<br/>Toutes les informations pour se rendre de l'aéroport à l'appartement sont parfaites.

Both Anna and her husband were super helpful with local tips, such as how to get to the airport, to and from the port, what to see, eat and do. We loved the little gifts, food and bottle of wine she left for us! Such a thoughtful touch! As well, our ferry was very late and Anna and her husband were very accommodating to that and waited for us :) Definitely recommend staying here!"

She surprised me with some baklava and a small gift upon my arrival. The space was comfortable and convenient. I highly recommend this place!"
14060811,267086694,2018-05-21,118384775,Tamás,"Anna valóban egy superhost. Az utazás előtt minden kérdésünkre szinte azonnal válaszolt. Pontos leírása alapján nagyon egyszerűen megtaláltuk a lakását. Szintén az utazás előtt ellátott minket tanácsokkal, hogy miket érdemes Athénban megnézni. Mire elindultunk neki köszönhetően már pontos információnk volt a tömegközlekedésről, a jegyek áráról (mind tömegközlekedés, mind Akropolisz és egyéb látnivalók). <br/><br/>A gépünk minimálisan késett, így picit később értünk oda a megbeszélt időpontnál,  ez azonban nem okozott Anna számára problémát, aki a lakásban várt minket. A lakás könnyen megközelíthető a reptérről metróval és busszal, így viszonylag hamar odaértünk (csatlakozástól függően akár 45 perc alatt). A lakás viszonylag a belvárosban van, kb. fél óra alatt be lehet sétálni a Monastirakihoz. <br/><br/>Anna vendégszeretete az első pillanattó kezdődően megmutatkozott. Érkezésünkre ajándékba kaptunk tőle apró szuveníreket, egy üveg bort és egy-egy görög édességet a helyi cukrászdából.  Az utolsó esténken pedig ő maga sütött nekünk isteni finom görög spenótos pitéket, amit felakasztott a kilincsre számunkra.<br/><br/>A lakás tökéletesen megfelelt az elvárásainknak. Mindent kaptunk, amire szükségünk volt, illetve azt is biztosított Anna, amit mi történetesen hoztunk (törölközők, bontatlan fogkefék, tusfürdő, sampon, folyékony szappan, ágynemű, kávé, tea, görög joghurtok, stb.). A lakás teljesen tiszta és felszerelt (a konyhában hűtő, mikró, sütő, tűzhely, a fürdőben mosógép, zuhanyzó, stb.). A meleg vizet szabályozó biztosítékot fürdés előtt fél órával fel kell kapcsolni, így bőven volt meleg víz két embernek. <br/><br/>Anna mindent elmondott, amit nekünk az utazásunk során tudni érdemes. Kaptunk térképet, amin bejelölte amit érdemes megnézni, és hogy hogyan könnyű őket megközelíteni. Külön ki voltak gyűjtve a legfontosabb nevezetességek címei, nyitvatartása, illetve az általa javasolt, a lakás közelében található éttermek is. Utóbbit (Rosalia) ki is próbáltuk és tökéletes választásnak bizonyult.<br/><br/>Mivel a repülőgépünk csak hétfő este indult vissza, és Annának csak kedden érkezett a következő vendége, biztosított minket, hogy akkor hagyjuk el a szállást, amikor nekünk kedvező.<br/><br/>Összességében csak pozitívat tudok mondani Annáról."
14060811,269841125,2018-05-28,91708625,Gabriela,"Anna es una perfecta anfitriona. La casa es tal y como se muestra en las fotografías, el servicio fue excelente. A nuestra llegada Anna nos estaba esperando en la casa para explicarnos todos los detalles de esta, nos había comprado unos dulces típicos griegos e incluso nos dió un mapa con indicaciones de lugares que no podíamos perdernos, entre los cuales destacó Aegina y Delfi, que nos encantaron. Durante nuestra estancia Anna estuvo en todo momento pendiente de nosotras, respondía con mucha prisa a nuestros mensajes vía Airbnb. Nos vamos muy contentas, recomendable al 100% si quieres pasar unos días y conocer Grecia y alrededores."
14060811,271372882,2018-06-01,127599432,Spring,"Anna’s place was beyond what we expected and was by far the nicest place we stayed in the 6 weeks of travel we just finished. She was so sweet and went above and beyond to make us feel at home. The apartment was the first place that we could get comfortable temperature wise because the AC was easy to use and cooled the room so quickly.  There were tips for around town and a chart she made with all the prices and opening times for all the Attractions. She had wonderful restaurant recommendations and left us the most thoughtful snacks, she was the perfect host, I would love to go stay at her place again."
14060811,272751897,2018-06-04,57192924,Angelinah,"This apartment is amazing. Value for money + more . Communication with Anna was very good, her directions to and from airport/around Athens was very easy to understand. We travelled confidently all along the metro/bus line and were provided with many suggestions and useful tips. I would highly recommend this cute little home. It is as per photos and and very clean with all the necessities included. Anna greeted us with little gifts and traditional Greek pastry. So glad to have met her and been a guest in her home. Thank you Anna would love to visit again. <br/>"

14060811,274417920,2018-06-09,25857438,Megan,My husband and I use airbnb a lot. We were only staying in Athens two nights so we booked this place based on location. It is amazing and I wish we had stayed longer. Anna left us wine and gifts. We had a rough flight and travel day coming into this stay and upon meeting Anna our day was completely transformed in a positive way. She really made our trip to Athens special and even without her kindness the trip would have been amazing because of the location and amenities of the place.
14060811,275880035,2018-06-12,22279161,Jérémie,Anna et Pierre sont des superhosts et vous vous en rendrez compte dès les premiers échanges.

14060811,292048219,2018-07-17,46294080,Matthew,"Anna and Petros get my highest review! Before we even arrived, they gave us perfect instructions on how to reach the apartment, and they even answer some of our travel questions. Petros greeted us after we got off the bus near the apartment. Anna and Petros spent part of their evening with us to offer us advice about our stay. They showed us maps of the city, timetables for the metro, and even gave us some clues about when to travel to certain places. Truly, Anna and Petros helped shape our trip in Greece. They exceed expectations and make you feel like family! Wonderful people!"
14060811,292942669,2018-07-19,30940448,Nica,We had a very nice stay at this accommodation; Anna and Petros are lovely and go above and beyond with thoughtful touches and any information or help you may need (including helping us find an atm + delicious place to eat and booking us a taxi to Pireas.)

14060811,310839258,2018-08-20,120872319,Elizabeth,"This apartment is great! Anna and her family are kind and understanding. We were an hour late for our check in due to getting lost and they were so understanding! The apartment is not near the city center. On a map of Athens it is way up to the right. However it is an easy 5-10 minute walk or bus ride frm the metro so we didn't find this to be an issue. We didn't feel comfortable walking to and from the metro to the apartment after it was dark so the area limited the amount of night life we could have however I'm sure it is no different than walking at night in any other big city. That is just not something we do but for someone who does, the area would not be a problem. The apartment itself was clean and homey! Anna left us some thoughtful touches like a bottle of wine she likes, toothbrushes, and yogurts. She gives you towels, bedding, laundry detergent and other amenities like that that really make your stay easier. Before we came she sent us a big list of recommendations of things we should do or see as well as helpful local tips. Overall, Anna is a wonderful hostess and the apartment was very nice! "

14060811,323742266,2018-09-16,161951993,Camillo,It is a very comfortable apartment. There is AC if it is too hot and heat if it is too cold for you. There is a comfortable spacious bed. There is plenty drawer and cabinet space for you to put your clothes and your knickknacks. There are about 3 or 4 chairs that are sturdy and durable. There is a small balcony where you can sit and enjoy your coffee or tea or whatever your choice drink is and at various times of the day you can hear the street symphony of Greece. If you’re not in the mood for that musical composition you can silence it by going into the apartment shutting the doors to a meditative serene silence. There  are curtains and shutters so you can control the degree of darkness you prefer. There is a room upon entering that has a low table where you can put your apt keys and wallet and other miscellaneous papers.  Your hosts also providedba printed out list of museums and nearby restaurants and  will help you person to person in giving you direction to where you might like to go. The bathroom is clean. They provide plenty towels of various shapes sizes and colors. I enjoyed the decor of the apartment. It’s well-planned: well-thoughtout. They stock the fridge. There is a window in they kitchen. A decent table. If a problem shoild arise. You can contact your hosts through Air bnb.  Thank you kindly to myna

Dejamos la llave dentro, y no sólo llegaron pronto, sino nos llevaron al metro para que no se nos hiciera tarde. Sinceramente, el mejor lugar para hospedarse en Atenas"

El departamento es muy cómodo, limpio, bien equipado y muy bien ubicado, pues se encuentra cercano al metro, a la parada de autobuses, aunque también es posible llegar al centro caminando en 15 minutos. Por último, me gustaría mencionar que Anna nos regaló un souvenir al llegar a su departamento, fue mucho más de lo que esperábamos, lo recomendamos totalmente !!"
14060811,334761954,2018-10-10,20828134,Rosie,Anna and her son Stavros were perfect hosts. First of all timely and accurate communication. Perfect directions from airport to apartment. The son called me while we we're on metro to make sure we were on our way. He met us at apartment and showed us around. Anna left 2 small gifts forus. Done wine and did the next morning breakfast.the need was very comfortable. We were out sms about each day there and so that worked out well. The best souflaki place was on the corner. We are there two nights of the 4 we were in Athens. Good meal and 2 beers under $ 10 EURO for the both of us. We went on a one day cruise and the cruise line picked us up at Hotel Zoliia which was 5 minutes from apartment so I was wondering how that works with side trips that promise hotel pickup when you are in an apartment so that worked outwell for us..the last full day we walked the 30 minutes to downtown to see everything<br/> It was a easy fun interesting walk we felt safe on metro which we took home. Lastly. I forget my mouth retainer on bedside. No time to return to get it. Anna went out of her way to wrap it well and send to me via airmail at no extra cost to me. What lovely service from a great 5 day stay in Athens. Definitely worth it. Thanks

Our flight was delayed but Anna’s directions made it easy to find and she was there to welcome us with homemade tiropita, delicious cakes, retsina and even gifts! The apartment was comfortable and spotless with everything we might need - even a sewing kit.  We loved the area with a great coffee shop around one corner and a big supermarket at the next, close to public transport.<br/>Petros, Anna’s husband took the time to visit with more local information and suggestions for day trips and food.<br/>This is how Airbnb should be!  We would love to return."
14060811,338270441,2018-10-19,35176794,Gillian,A big thank you to Anna and Petros who were fantastic in every aspect of my stay. They made sure my stay was very comfortable even to the extent of Anna baking me beautiful pies. my first time in Athens was a very good experience due to their help.  I would highly recommend staying in this lovely little central apartment.
14060811,339886269,2018-10-22,32940190,Erin,Anna and her husband are very sweet! They provided wonderful directions and were very nice - even let us keep our luggage in their house during our last day while we waited for a late flight. Thank you!
14060811,340800197,2018-10-25,1691671,Andrea,"I can't say enough nice things about Anna and her apartment.  She is indeed the epitome of a SUPER HOST and literally thought of everything you might need for a perfect stay in Athens.  Her place was clean, comfortable, centrally located, fully stocked with all necessities, and everything we needed/wanted and more for our stay in Greece.  She was extremely thoughtful providing us with souvenirs, homemade food, and even a refrigerator of groceries.  Her and her son took the time to advise us on the best places to visit while we were there, and made it known they would be available to help with anything we needed 24 hours a day.  I've traveled to many countries and stayed in many Airbnbs and Anna is by far the best host I've ever had the privilege to book with.  Thank you, Anna!"
14060811,342637180,2018-10-29,188276880,Pia,"Die kleine Wohnung ist für einen Städtetrip durch Athen wie geschaffen. Sie liegt nicht so weit vom Zentrum entfernt, dass man ewig mit Bussen usw. unterwegs ist, aber auch nicht so dicht, dass der Touri-Trubel einen nicht schlafen lässt. Es fehlte an nichts. Ein Supermarkt ist direkt um die Ecke und die Akropolis erreicht man in gut 30 Minuten zu Fuß. Einzig die für den Süden übliche fehlende Isolation der Fenster ließ und so manches Mal aufwachen, als Bauarbeiter irgendwas in Containern geschmissen haben.<br/>Anna ist eine wirklich zuvorkommende Gastgeberin, es gab zur Begrüßung eine ausführliche Einweisung in alle Funktionen der Wohnung, Tips für unseren Trip und auch noch selbstgemachte Pita. Wir fühlten uns wirklich sehr wohl"
14060811,348294247,2018-11-13,106927236,Bertrand,"Un acceuil et une serviabilité incroyable. Du jamais vu (et pourtant j'en ai fait des airbnb). Anna et Pierre son mari, ont tout fait pour que mon passage dans leur appartement se déroule au mieux, depuis les instructions d'arrivée en passant par les visites obligatoires d'Athènes (ils ont créé leur propre guide) jusqu'aux conseils pour vivre au mieux dans le quartier où est situé l'appart (liste de supermarché, bar et restaurant qu'ils nous recommandent). En résumé, un 20/20 en hospitalité, service et propreté!<br/>Seul petite (toute petite) note négative pour les personnes comme moi qui ont le sommeil léger (et seulement celle-ci), et même si la rue est très peu transitée, c'est que les bruits de rue s'invitent de nuit. L'appartement étant situé en rez de chaussée avec une fênêtre en bois peu isolante fait que l'on peux être géné par les bruits de la rue. Mais j'insiste que seules les personnes au someil léger seront affectées et que cela se résout très facilement avec des boules quies. <br/>En résumé, vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés et en plus à seulement 15/20min à pied du centre ville! Que demandez de plus?<br/><br/>Muy mucho recomendado! No voy a traducirlo todo (pare eso esta el  (Hidden by Airbnb) translator) pero sinceramente una experiencia genial. Pueden ir los ojos cerrados!!!<br/><br/>Molt molt recomendable! No vaig a traduir tot (per això esta el (Hidden by Airbnb) translator) pero sincerament ha sigut una experiencia genial! Poden anar els ulls tancats!!!"
14060811,349033311,2018-11-16,146641447,Konsta,Staying at the apartment was above my expectations. Anna was really friendly and made me feel very welcome to the city. I definitely recommend this place for people travelling alone or for couples
14060811,350364517,2018-11-19,131486930,Dave,Anna is the perfect host. The place is exactly as pictured and we had everything we needed. No complaints!

La cocina, baño y habitación impecables, tal como se ve en las fotos, el apartamento cuenta con todas las facilidades para sentirse como en casa. Está cerca a pie o en transporte al centro de la ciudad, recomiendo totalmente su servicio."

So kind and caring (lovely homemade pies and even gifts for my children!), quick responses to messages, and plenty of information to help you with your stay.<br/>The apartment is close to the centre, a plesant short walk to Kolonaki, Plaka and all the sites. The apartment was sparkling clean, and wonderfully homely. Perfect for a short trip to Athens. I cannot recommend highly enough!"

A metrótól 230-as busszal 3 megálló, de gyalog sincs messze és a 2. megálló után van egy nagy szupermarket, korrekt árakon. A lakás nagyon barátságos, jól felszerelt. A vendéglátó rendkívül kedves, segítőkész. Nagyon jól éreztük magunkat."

Even before we landed Anna provided us detailed guidelines on how to reach the property detailing every step.<br/>We had a very smooth welcoming checking by Petros wherein he explained us the property, the location and amenities. He also explained us details on Athens city and how to commute and how to plan our trip.<br/>The property was sparkling clean, very cozy and 10 minutes away from the city center (via bus with bus stand about 100-200 mts away). The heating system worked pretty well and we were provided with additional blankets just in case if there is a need. The Christmas tree decorated by Anna added so much to our festive vacation. <br/>Over and above this there were the add-ons which really made out trip great:<br/>1) Anna and Petros gave us Greek souvenirs<br/>2) They left some Greek authentic sweets for us<br/>3) They left us with authentic Greek white wine (we are sorry we could not try it as we are teetotalers)<br/>4) It was a holiday that day in Athens with most of the shops closed and we needed printouts for our boarding passes. Petros was very kind enough to get these from his home/office. <br/><br/>Overall our stay was great and we would recommend the property to others as well.<br/><br/>Thanks Anna and Petros."

14060811,401311188,2019-01-14,120525628,Kinga,"Anna és a férje, Petros fantasztikus vendéglátók. Anna már a foglalás pillanatától ellátott minden tudnivalóval és biztosított róla, hogy bármikor kereshetjük. A lakás kicsi, de kényelmes, felszerelve szó szerint mindennel, amire szükségünk lehetett, és még annál is többel. Bár éjfél körül érkeztünk, kedvesen mosolyogva vártak, házi sütivel, görög borral, teli hűtővel és ajándékokkal. Minden szükséges információt megkaptunk a lakásról, a környező kávézókról és éttermekről, a látnivalókról, közlekedésről, stb. A környék rendben volt, este kicsit nehézkesnek éreztük a közlekedést, de kis odafigyeléssel ez is jól működött. Az egyetlen hátránya a lakásnak, hogy kicsit sötét és kevés benne a tér, így annak ideális, aki napközben a várost járja és csak estére tér vissza. A kiemelkedő vendégszeretet nagyban hozzájárult a szuper athéni élményekhez, Annát csak ajánlani tudjuk!"

If you imagine a typical “Greek mom” making sure you are fed and happy, she is much like that. <br/>The apartment was in a great location and quite safe - close to the bus and a short ride on it to the metro if you wish to take it. It is a few minute walk to the bus stop but very easy to get to. It is great for a traveling couple to stay.<br/>Anna has maps and recommendations for Athens which really helped. Best places to eat, see,  etc.<br/>One side note to remember when seeing the sights or the markets is WATCH YOUR BELONGINGS! If you have a purse keep it closed and close to you. Also if someone tries to hand you a flower or bracelet it is NOT free. They will want money for it. Best is just to keep moving. <br/><br/>Hope all this helps and Happy Travels!"

It's located easy walking distance from all the wonderful tourist spots in Athens, while still having a the feel of a real neighborhood, with similarly priced restaurants and stores nearby. <br/>Anna herself was fantastic. She greeted us at the apartment, gave us a quick tour, and offered us homemade banitza (savory baked goods) and a small bottle of wine upon our arrival. She showed us a map of Athens, and gave us wonderful advice that complimented our stay. I can't recommend her place enough."

They are the living embodiment of Hospitality!<br/><br/>Anna and her husband were both at the apartment waiting for me when arrived. They had a meal waiting for me, a bottle of Greek wine and a refrigerator stocked with a few items to save me the trouble of running to a grocery store right away!<br/><br/>That last part, I’ve never seen from any Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at... and I’ve stayed in ALOT. The space is lovely and just right for one to two people. I was solo and it was perfect. Sometimes I felt so at home, it took an extra bit of effort to force myself out of the place lol.<br/><br/>It’s located in a totally central area, perfect for walking to the sites(it’s actually easier to just walk to a lot of things) there’s a supermarket and other little markets, literally 10 feet from the apartment.<br/><br/>Anna and Petros were extremely fast in their responses to any questions, took their time to explain the ins and outs of both the apartment and Athens when I checked it. They have lists and lists of things to and details on them when you arrive.<br/><br/>I had a great stay and it was made memorable thanks to Anna and Petros’ incredible hospitality."

Anna provided us with excellent instructions on how to get from the airport to the flat, and greeted us herself which was really nice. She even prepared us some traditional Greek food which was delicious! At the end of our stay, she even let us keep our luggage in her own home for the day as our flight was very late at night.

Bugüne kadar yaşadığım Airbnb deneyimleri içinde en güzel karşılamaydı. Evde börekle ve geleneksel Yunan şarabı ile karşılandık, ayrıca Anna bizim için küçük hediyeler almıştı. Hatta arkadaşımın nereden bulabilirim diye sorduğu bir tatlıyı bile hemen dışarıdan alıp gelecek, Paskalya dönemi olması nedeni ile aile yemekleri için evlerine davet edecek kadar ince bir çift Anna ve Petros. Evin konumu güzel. Otobüs duraklarına yakın ve yürüyerek de 20 dkya direkt Syntagma'ya inebiliyorsunuz. Ev çiftler için harikaydı. Ufak detaylara kadar hersey kalanların rahatı için düşünülmüştü. Anna ve Petros ev sahibinden ziyade birer abi abla gibiydi. Herşey için tekrar çok teşekkürler Anna ve Petros."

She really wanted us to have the best possible experience visiting her native Country. We were given a tour of the neighborhood and guides to all to see and do.<br/>The home was in pristine condition. She even had the fridge with different native foods to sample and If you're nice she might even leave special treats for you to try. I love the neighborhood and the easy access to the city. I had a great time.
14060811,453598066,2019-05-16,138455645,Leona,This is an amazing apartment very conveniently located.

Anna and her husband gave us the perfect instructions, from how to catch the metro, which ticket to buy & how maneuver through the city. We followed them to a T and did not get lost once. We also were able to experiment Athens, by foot, which I highly recommend. Buses are great, but nothing beats walking. Theses an amazing restaurant on the corner that opens up at night, serves the best slouvaki we had in Greece. We ate there twice actually! Then room was beautiful & so well kept. The price was also the best on the area for all it has to offer. There was even a converter in the room that we got to use, since we forgot to buy one.<br/><br/>If you need a place to stay, look no further!"

Anna nous avait prepare un petit casse-croute local a deguste,  ils nous ont aussi offert un bouteille  de vin et des petits souvenirs locaux. <br/><br/>Petit plus, ils sont tous les 2 bilingues en francais ;)<br/><br/>Anna et son mari nous ont offert un accueil tres chaleureux, super communication, je recommende vivement !"
14060811,461211258,2019-05-31,177705494,Sergio,"Desde luego, si sois una pareja que quiere visitar Atenas y busca alojarse en un buen sitio, este es el apartamento ideal. Si bien parece está alejado de zonas a visitar como la Acropolis, no está a más de una hora andando: muchísimo menos en transporte público. La atención que ofrecen Anna y Petros es única, siendo unos anfitriones que destacan más de lo normal. En definitiva, es un piso sencillo y cómodo que tiene todo lo que necesitas para tener una bonita estancia en esta ciudad."
14060811,462411427,2019-06-02,19244042,Onno,"Een nette plek, echter lopend nogal ver van centrum of metrostation. Wel goed per bus bereikbaar. In de nabijheid bars en een goed en goedkoop restaurant."
14060811,463892645,2019-06-04,132326177,Emily,Anna communicated amazingly and is super helpful/ willing. Would highly recommend to anyone!
14060811,465177932,2019-06-07,231254748,Gisela,"Pasamos tres días excelentes, porque Anna nos atendió de una manera muy afectuosa. Nos esperó con un delicioso refrigerio y estuvo en todo momento atenta a lo que podíamos necesitar. Sin dudar volveremos a su departamento en nuestro próximo viaje.  El alojamiento está equipado con todo lo necesario hasta los mínimos detalles."
14060811,468243183,2019-06-12,233585844,Tracey,"Anna and her husband Petros are perfect hosts, and their apartment was the most thoughtfully prepared of all the apartments I’ve stayed at so far! They had baklava, wine, snacks AND souvenir gifts for us waiting upon check in, and the fridge is fully stocked with more snacks & breakfast items than we knew what to do with!! Although the space is a little small it is totally manageable for two people. It was comfortable and we really appreciated all the effort that had clearly gone into providing tips, recommendations and amenities so visitors have the best possible stay. The location is also great, very easy to get to from the airport, and it is just at the foot of Mt Lycabettus so I highly recommend you climb it in the afternoon to catch the sunset! We had a wonderful time in Athens."
14060811,469693685,2019-06-15,213048988,Kayla,"Anna was more than accommodating,  very helpful with suggestions around Athens.  She went above and beyond to make us feel right at home. The appartment was very conveniently located and within walking distance."
14060811,472251472,2019-06-19,42846173,Jules,Anna et Pierre sont des hôtes formidables.  Toujours prêts à nous aider. L'appartement est top et bien situé.
14060811,473738816,2019-06-22,70031121,Niamh,"Anna’s apartment in Athens was fantastic! Prior to the arrival of our stay Anna was easy to contact, she gave plenty of information regarding how to reach the apartment and things to do whilst in Athens. When we arrived at the apartment Anna’s husband Petros greeted us and explained everything we needed to know about the apartment. He also gave us information about sights worth seeing and costs and transport. Anna had made us some gorgeous spinach and cheese pastry pies and left us some little gifts and a bottle of wine! This was such a lovely and unexpected touch. The apartment itself was in an ideal location, close to a metro station, supermarket and also Lycabettus hill. <br/>The space within the apartment was ideal for 2, with all the amenities you could ever need whilst on holiday. We could’ve turned up with nothing and we would’ve been fine due to the toiletries, food etc which Anna had provided us. Anna was also very helpful with organising us a taxi to the port to catch our ferry, she works with a lovely man named George who gave us a reasonable price from the apartment to the port. <br/>I would undoubtedly stay in this apartment again if I ever visit Athens in the future and highly recommend this to anyone thinking of visiting Athens! 10/10 stay.<br/>Niamh and Amber"
14060811,475311317,2019-06-24,40704813,Chantel,The apartment is very nice. Has everything that one would need. Very close to transit stops and is located near the bus stop that takes you directly to the Acropolis. They were very friendly and respond very quickly and are accommodating when our flight was delayed
14060811,477320064,2019-06-28,206879168,Laura,"Our first time using Airbnb, a little bit nervous, Anna's place was absolutely amazing and we loved our short stay in Athens. Anna was so helpful, providing lots and lots of information about where to go and how to get around! There were little personal touches in the apartment, such as homemade Greek pastry and little souvenirs Anna had got us, as well as food in the fridge and plenty of maps. The apartment itself was bigger than  expected (from photos), it wasn't massive but there were only 2 of us and we were there for 3 nights so it suited us perfectly. It felt very homely with a little balcony which we opened up for lunch. The location of the apartment is nice; it isn't in the main tourist area of Athens (near the Acropolis), but is walking distance from an area with plenty of nice Greek restaurants, which we found cheaper than the main tourist areas. There was also a supermarket less than 1 minute away. However, it was fairly easy to get into the main city centre. The nearest metro station (which worked exactly like the London underground), was a 10-15 minute walk away and then only a few stops. It was a lot easier to navigate than the London underground as well! There is a bus stop very close which, in theory, would take you to the city centre, but it only came every 30 mins and was very busy when we did finally see one, so we stuck to using the metro. We may have just been unlucky though. It was easy to get to from both the airport and the harbour on the metro. <br/>The only thing we struggled with was that the shower head was not attached to the wall so we had some awkward showers holding it up ourselves. <br/>Overall, we loved our stay in Athens and Anna's place. It was sweet and cosy, with a lovely host and a good location that let you see other parts of Athens rather than just the main tourist area. We would highly recommend staying at Anna's place. Thank you Anna :)"
14060811,479553957,2019-07-01,153356855,Veruska,"Lovely appartment! Anna is  amazing, good communication and always ready to help. Location is good, near minimarkets, cafes, and restaurants, few minutes from the subway (Ambelokipi) and near the bus stop, but if you don't mind to walk, you can enjoy the view in a 20 min walking until Plaka."
14060811,485679817,2019-07-11,126295450,Cora,Nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans l'appartement d'Anna. Il est fonctionnel et bien placé. Les commerces sont dans la même rue et la station de métro Ambelokipi assez proche. Nous remercions Anna et son mari qui nous ont été d'une aide précieuse lors de notre arrivée et qui ont été très réactifs tout au long de notre séjour. Nous avons également apprécié toutes les petites attentions des hôtes pour que nous nous sentions comme à la maison.
14060811,487462359,2019-07-14,244383926,Lucy,"Anna is such a kind host, she greeted us with home cooked pastries and wine, and showed us everything we needed for our stay in Athens. The apartment itself is in a good location for trains to the airport as well as buses to and from the city center. The value for money is great and we would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in Athens!"

14060811,501788117,2019-08-04,97644066,Raquel,"La casa está al lado del monte Licabeto, que ofrece las mejores vistas de Atenas y una puesta de sol increíble.<br/><br/>Está un poco alejado del centro y los lugares turísticos, las conexiones en metro y bus no son la mejor opción, pero por 5-6 euros en taxi o Beat puedes llegar a los lugares de interés. <br/><br/>Sin embargo, cualquier pega que se le pueda poner al apartamento la suple la hospitalidad de su dueña, que nos recibió con plato y vino típicos de Grecia y regalos para los huéspedes."
14060811,504219188,2019-08-07,9297849,Nikolay,"Огромное спасибо хозяйке Anna и ее мужу Petros! Начну свой отзыв с того что приехали раньше времени и попросили оставить вещи, Anna пошла нам на встречу и это существенно облегчило заселение и мы пошли гулять уже без вещей. Квартира отличная , в ней все есть , все продумано до мелочей! Огромное спасибо Anne и ее мужу за маленькие подарки и за возможность перекусить после дороги , это было настоящим сюрпризом! Гостеприимство Anna и Petros просто необычайное , создаётся ощущение что приехали к родственникам )) Наш отдых в Афинах прошёл на «Ура» , и не маловажную роль в этом сыграло то место где мы остановились!"

Wir wurden unglaublich freundlich begrüßt von Annas Sohn, Stavros, der sich Zeit genommen hat, uns alles Wichtige zu zeigen. Anna war unfassbar süß und hat uns etwas zu Essen und zwei Willkommensgeschenke bereitet, weil sie selbst bei unserer Ankunft nicht da sein konnte. Das Apartment hat über alles verfügt, was wir brauchten, und war sehr sauber und super gelegen. Außerdem hat Anna uns auf jede Nachricht sehr schnell und super ausführlich geantwortet und uns sehr viele Tipps gegeben. Ich würde das Apartment absolut weiterempfehlen!"

Esam labai dėkingi už puikiai praleistą laiką. Ačiū!"

We arrived at 1:00 a.m., but Petros still met us at the apartment to welcome us and give us recommendations for transportation, tourism, and dinning. Anna also sent us detailed information for easy transport to and from the airport and metro. Anna had purchased us small tokens to remember Athens and had fresh pastries waiting for us when we arrived! The apartment was very clean and fully stocked for whatever we may need while we were there. They also had groceries in the fridge for our time, which was appreciated. We enjoyed our stay!!"

14060811,559454395,2019-11-04,58733814,Vyacheslav,"Все положительные отзывы об этих апартаментах и их хозяевах - чистейшая правда! Анна и Петрос сделали всё, чтобы наше посещение Афин было максимально комфортным, предугадывали наши желания, давали бесценные советы и во всех ситуациях шли навстречу. Благодаря их радушию мы не испытали неудобств ни из-за позднего прибытия, ни из-за необходимости где-нибудь пристроить багаж до обратного вылета. Думается, мало кто из путешествующих может ожидать по заселению угощение свежеиспечёнными пирогами, вином, да ещё и набор продуктов в холодильнике. Кухня укомплектована всей необходимой техникой; абсолютно всё необходимое - чай, кофе, сахар, крупы, специи, посуда, приборы, ... - аккуратно разложено по шкафчикам и готово к использованию. Медикаменты, фен, шампуни, ... - вспоминается фраза из Чехова: ""В Греции всё есть!"" ))) Чистота и порядок - идеальные. Есть даже балкончик, где можно выпить чашечку кофе с сигаретой, если ещё не избавился от этого пристрастия.<br/>Апартаменты расположены в тихом районе, до супермаркета одна минута хода, до автобусных остановок - 2-3 минуты. Маршрут 230 проходит через Университет, Синтагму и Храм Зевса до Акрополя (единственный из городских маршрутов; правда, с большими интервалами). Вершина Ликавита - в пешей доступности, по ощущениям не намного труднее, чем подъём на фуникулёре, до которого тоже надо идти в гору.<br/>Проживание в таком месте так же скрасило наш отдых в Афинах.<br/>Спасибо Анне и Петросу, это было незабываемо!"
14060811,561840312,2019-11-10,209939040,Lizbeth,"Excelente servicio por parte de Anna y su esposo, demasiado amables. Las i stalaciones perfectas, no escatiman en nada todo te lo ofrecen. Muy recomendable para hospedarse ahí, el lugar muy tranquilo y cerca de todo."

It was extremely clean and well managed. Anna was very helpful and welcoming. She responded quickly to any questions we had and did a great job explaining everything during the check-in process. The location is good, with a supermarket very close by, as well as public transport within walking distance. We would definitely stay here again."

Arrivée sur place, elle m’a accueillie avec un grand sourire, m’a tout expliquer sur les moyens de transports etc en prime j’ai eu droit à un petit cadeau de bienvenue, de la nourriture dans le frigo, elle m’avait même fait des « pita » fourrés aux épinards et fromage. Café thé à volonté. C’est une femme  adorable. Que dire de la netteté de l’appartement : très propre. On s’y sent comme à la maison. Idéal pour une personne seule ou couple.

The area feels very safe and its filled with tons of amazing restaurants and cafes. Anna was an amazing host and her son gave a perfect rundown of all the best nightlife and restaurants. I can not recommend this AirBnB enough! Also, try the Gyros wraps up the street from the stay (may have had one everyday)."

Then he elaborately explained everything in the apartment. We had a power outage due to overuse of electricity, his wife Anna came within 30 minutes and fixed the issue. They also gave us great advice regarding places to go and transportation system. They are super hosts. I will recommend them to anyone. Also their place is in a very convenient location which is a big plus. They made us feel like we were home."

I didn’t spend too much time inside because I was limited on the time I had to visit the city. But found the apt to be very comfortable. She welcomed me with snacks and home made Greek treats. And fixings for breakfast was also in the fridge. She just made it super convenient and way. If you are a solo traveler or with a partner this is a great location and Anna is a lovely host. <br/>The neighborhood felt safe and hip. Great coffee and food options. <br/>Efharisto Anna. Merci :)

14060811,599452394,2020-01-30,144352052,Fernando,"¡Qué hermosa que es Atenas! Nos encantó y nos quedamos sorprendidos de lo fácil que es recorrerla tanto a pie como en transporte público. Nosotros los primeros días caminamos y a lo último, un poquito más cansados, sacamos un ticket de transporte de 24 hs, ya sabiendo por dónde íbamos. Un día llegamos hasta la estación Victoria, por la zona compramos unas Tirópitas y un vino griego a muy buen precio.<br/>El departamento está muy bien ubicado, hay muchos supermercados y tiendas varias (bares, kioskos, panaderías, etc). Está a una distancia caminable de Plaza Sintagma donde podés apreciar el cambio de guardia del Parlamento. Desde allí, la Acrópolis no queda mucho más lejos. <br/>Después de cada día de recorrido era un placer volver al departamento de Anna y Petros. Ellos le ponen muchísima dedicación y eso hace la estadía verdaderamente amena. Cuenta con cocina completa, lavarropas, wifi, televisión. <br/>Anna nos envió información detalla de antemano para llegar y Petros nos recibió muy cordialmente. Nos dio muchos tips sobre paseos y transporte y nos mostró cosas útiles en el departamento. Pudimos hacerle consultas y nos hizo buenas recomendaciones. Ellos se preocupan por dejar algunos elementos listos para el desayuno e incluso alguna cena, además de que tienen atenciones especiales para recibir al huésped. Tenemos una lista larga de cosas buenas para escribir de Anna y Petros, la verdad debería estar la opción de otorgarles más estrellas!!!"

The apartment is set up in a very homely manner and is exceptionally clean.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that there is a 24 hour bar/cafe in close proximity, so there was occasional noise during the night. But overall we had a lovely time. Thank you Anna."

Είναι σε πολύ καλή τοποθεσία, κοντά σε στάση λεωφορείου και μετρό, αλλά μπορείς να πας παντού και με τα πόδια. Οι παροχές είναι υπεραρκετες και η κυρία Άννα τρομερά εξυπηρετική.

Anna greeted us on our arrival with homemade pastries and small gifts, and made sure to give us lots of handy local knowledge and advice. The flat itself was perfect, very clean and comfortable, with fantastic air conditioning (very important in the Greek summer!). Anna had even stocked the fridge with some food for our breakfast the next morning. She and her husband were quick to respond to texts, and gave us many useful details for transport links etc. The flat is close to the National Archaeological Museum, and an enjoyable 40 minute walk to the Acropolis, but there are also plenty of buses going by. I cannot recommend this Airbnb enough! A perfect place to stay for our short trip to Athens."

Sie hat uns umfangreiche Tips für Athen gegeben, und auch für uns den besten Weg zum Hafen nach der Abreise herausgesucht. <br/>Die Wohnung ist klein, aber mit allem ausgestattet, was man so braucht - Anna hat uns auch vieles an teils selbstgemachten Lebensmitteln bereitgestellt. Die Lage ist gut, man geht etwa 30 Minuten zur Akropolis, und auch die anderen Sehenswürdigkeiten sind per Fuß zu erreichen - es bieten sich aber auch die Öffis an. <br/><br/>Für ein paar Tage in Athen sehr zu empfehlen!"

The best advise was to visit one of nearby islands, where we've tasted the best pistachio spread, icecream and liquor. Flat is very clean and centrally located with lots of bars and restaurants, next to supermarket and the highest hill of Athens with a beautiful view over the city. You can reach bus station within less than 2 minutes, or metro station that will take you to the airport within 15 minutes walking distance. On the last day Anna has offered us to store our luggage after checkout, so we could fully enjoy last day of holidays as we had flight in the evening. Fully deserved 5 stars!"

14060811,746771201,2021-04-08,14291365,Tina,"This was the warmest and nicest reception I have ever experienced through Airbnb, almost like visiting an family member of yours that you were not able to visit for a while. Anna was so kind and let me check-in early which was so helpful and made life so much easier for me. She had little welcome souvenirs and a fridge full of food so I wouldn’t need to go buy groceries and could really just arrive and relax first. Besides that, she handed me a delicious piece of a homemade traditional pie she baked that day for her own family and made sure to share a piece with me. <br/>Needless to say, I felt very welcome and well taken care of and the apartment is located in my favorite area of Athens! Very convenient with lots of cute coffee shops and random little stores that make great gift shopping. <br/>This is a great place to stay and I can recommend it to everyone visiting lovely Athens who like to have an authentic experience!<br/>Thank you, Anna. I hope to see you again :)"

14060811,764633985,2021-05-31,176418317,Samer,"Anna's apartment is located in a prime location in the center of Athens (when driving to the apartment, make sure that you have the correct address as there is a similarly-named street in a southern district of the city). When I arrived at the apartment, Anna and Petros gave me a warm welcome (we spoke in French half of the time) and had even brought me a homemade meal! It goes without saying that the apartment was impeccably clean. Moreover, there were clever additions here and there to overcome the small space, such as a clothesline over the tub. As to the kitchen, the fridge was stocked with food and there were many amenities such as coffee and an assortment of teabags. Anna and Petros were very accommodating and even gave me tips and directions on how to reach my ferry two days later. If you arriving in a car, you will find parking spaces around the neighborhood.<br/><br/>This is a very recommended apartment and Anna earns her Superhost badge with flying colors! Sos efcharistos!!"

Apartmán čistý, pekný, pre našu potrebu nadštandardne vybavený (chladnička, trúba, sporák, práčka, fén, žehlička).  V chladničke boli nejaké potraviny na začiatok. Pre dvoch úplne postačujúci. Lokalita veľmi dobrá, dostupnosť centra peši aj MHD. Hneď  za rohom obchod. Odporučené reštaurácie 15 minút  chôdzou - ak chcete výborné jedlo za výbornú cenu s pravou aténskou atmosférou, určite si dajte poradiť, neoľutujete. Veľmi sme boli spokojné, vrelo odporúčame a ďakujeme za všetko."

She gave us a lot of useful information about the city and the neighborhood.<br/>We didn't expect the apartment to be so good! It may not be brand new, but it was super clean and cozy. We really enjoyed our stay there. One thing we didn't like was the location as the apartment is quite far from the metro stations, but I'm sure it's possible to get everywhere by bus.

Ils nous avaient même preparé des pains pita et fait quelques courses pour le petit déjeuner. Au delà de leur accueil, l’appartement est très bien équipé (machine à laver, fer à repasser, bocaux de pâtes et de riz, condiments...), des plans de la ville et les bonnes adresses sont à notre disposition, parfait pour passer quelques jours dans la capitale. Enfin, nous avons malheureusement perdu des papiers d’identité dans Athènes et Anna nous a immédiatement aidé en nous conduisant au poste de police et à l’ambassade en nous servant d’interprète, un grand merci à elle."

Anna nous a aussi fourni plein d'explications quant à nos différents trajets entre le port/l'aéroport, et s'est adaptée facilement à notre horaire de départ aux aurores! Sachant que nous prenions un bateau pour Sifnos, son mari Pierre est venu nous déposer dans la journée les formulaires à remplir pour le port. Nous ne pouvons que recommander!"

<br/>The flat is conveniently located, very close to the centre. It took me about 30 minutes to walk to Acropolis. If you are staying in Athens only for a few days, you can take a sightseeing bus which will also take you to the port and seaside, otherwise, you can walk everywhere from Fotini's flat. A very historical and cute place Plaka is also very close to her flat. 
<br/>The flat itself is very tidy, comfortable bed, good Wi-Fi and good value for money. In fact, you have everything you need. 
<br/>IMPORTANT: if you do not like the dogs or you are scared of them, please bear in mind that there is a lovely DOG in the house called Publitto. Although he is still a puppy, size wise, he is quite big. Being the animal lover, I really enjoyed having the dog in the house and paying with him. He even woke up at 2am to kind of say 'goodbye' to me when I was heading to the airport. However, if you don't like the dogs, I would recommend staying somewhere else to avoid any disappointments.

Fotini was very understanding and helped me with getting settled and woke up really early in the morning with me to make sure I left on time to catch my flight. Her place is comfortable and as described, close to the metro stop, very easy to find with her detailed instructions. I wish I stayed longer!

The apartment is old but beautifully-decorated and very conveniently-located. Supermarket and boulangerie all less than 2-3min walk away. Metro station 5-7min walk away. 20min to Syntagma Square, the very heart of Athens.<br/><br/>I did not check the photos clearly and was a bit surprised at the size of Pablo (Fotoni's dog), who, despite his excitement at our first meeting, turned put to be a quite gentle animal and we got along fairly well."

The room is very nice. Definitely not a place for non-smokers though and Pablo, the dog, was cute but a bit uncontrollable - he kept trying to run into our room. Would also be nice if the toilet had a lock, though otherwise it was a nice, clean and neat apartment."

What we got was so much more! Fotini made us feel right at home and took care of us like family. We had a lot of fun sitting in the flat and talking with her after our days out and playing with her sweet puppy Pablo. She even made us some incredible meals and cake. Liking dogs is a necessity as Pablo is pretty energetic, but we are pet people so loved having Pablo and her cat around. If you are after a comfortable room, a good location and great company, this Airbnb is perfect! I look forward to staying here again next time I am in Athens :)"

Fotini is so caring and kind, she and her place are so welcoming and I am very lucky to have stayed with her for my first time in Athens. She is there if you need anything but also allows you to have your own space. And her dog Pablo is a treasure! He is so loving, just like his owner. The flat is central and very close to all buses and the red Metro line. The area around the flat is fun and lively and has restaurants and shops near to, but is also somehow incredibly quiet at night for sleeping. The bedroom was very comfortable-especially the bed itself! The bathroom and kitchen has everything you need. I highly recommend staying with Fotini!  "

Sie ist eine sehr warmherzige Person, war immer freundlich und wir haben uns nie bedrängt gefühlt. Ihr junger Hund hat uns wohl sofort ins Herz geschlossen und ist etwas übermütig, aber sehr lieb und wenn man die Zimmertür zumacht hat man auch seine Ruhe. Das Zimmer sieht aus wie beschrieben und der Balkon mit den vielen Pflanzen bietet genug Platz, um dort zu zweit gemütlich zu sitzen. Da er zur Straße hinausgeht ist es etwas laut, aber man kann auf jeden Fall morgens seinen Kaffee oder abends ein Bier dort trinken. Die gesamte Wohnung war sehr sauber gehalten. Die Lage war für uns perfekt, nicht zu zentral und somit nicht sehr touristisch, aber nah genug, dass man leicht alles zu Fuß erreichen kann. Der Stadtteil Exarchia ist sehr spannend, man merkt allerdings, dass Touristen eher nicht so gern gesehen werden. Insgesamt hatten wir einen wundervollen Aufenthalt bei Fotini und würden auf jeden Fall wieder zu ihr gehen, wenn wir Athen mal wieder besuchen. "

14081186,168286448,2017-07-09,40579254,Jude,Fotoini is a wonderful welcoming host. Her apartment is very central and easily walkable to the Acropolis Museum and other tourist spots as well as public transport. Fotini is always ready with information about Athens and Greece generally and a highlight of my stay was having dinner of her cooking one evening. The area at first glance seems a bit run down with all the graffiti but take the time to walk around-it's very hip and happening and there are a few great shops. Fotini's dog Pablo is really well trained - a lovely dog to be around. Overall I highly recommend Fotini's to you.

Her pup Pablito was just as friendly and he was also very well behaved. We slept really well in the bed and felt rested in the morning. There is a fantastic family restaurant two blocks away and many more to choose from just another block or two over. We really liked Fotini and her dog Pablito. Great stay!

It is within walkable distance from the main attractions and you do not even need to use the metro. The room was spotlessly clean and had a very comfortable mattress.  The energy of the place and Fotini herself was very uplifting. The main asset of the this staying is Fotini herself. She is very welcoming, and has a very positive and pure energy. She is very relaxed at communication and too accommodating to her guests' needs. She also shares the apartment with her adorable dog Paulito.He is one of the cutes creatures that I have ever met. He is too quiet and good natured. Overall I am rating this airbnb experience with 5 stars and I am looking forward to going back in my next visit to Athens. Thank you Fotini. :)"

She has a friendly dog named Pablo who was fun to play with. Her house is a 10 minute walk to a popular square and  20-30mins to all of the sightseeing and cool neighborhoods. There are several lively bars full of locals. Can't find a better place to stay especially for the value. I had a great time. :)

Our travels were off schedule but Fotini allowed us to check in early, welcomed us with fresh squeezed orange juice and gave us a map to guide us around the city.

The shower was nice and warm and the apartment throughout was spotless and clean with good wifi. <br/><br/>A great value place, in the most interesting part of Athens, with two super friendly hosts.

She was always asking if we needed anything and made sure we knew everything was at our disposal in her home. <br/><br/>Her dog Pablo was an absolute treat as well (we love dogs!!); he's very quiet and affectionate (loves belly rubs). <br/><br/>Kitchen is a bit small to cook in (not impossible) but we didn't use it as you can find local gyros for only 2 euros!<br/><br/>Overall no real complaints, we had fresh linen and towels, a cute dog and snacks to come home to, and a happy host to greet us.<br/><br/>Thanks again Fontini!"

Around the area are places to get easy, quick food (including a bodega next door), but Fotini can also help you plan a visit into the busier parts of town. Will definitely stay here again if I have the chance!"

14081186,246762612,2018-03-26,62970766,Amanda,"Fotini is one of the nicest and friendliest  people I have ever met. The moment we arrived to her clean and lovely Airbnb, she invited us to have a traditional Greek dinner with her (it was a holiday). She gave us wine, a main course and dessert ( she wouldn’t let us buy anything to add to the dinner, she just wanted help). The meal was abosolutely delicious!  Then we ate and talked for hours. It was my favorite experience in Athens. Also she has two pets Toni and Pablo, they are the sweetest and cutest animals I have ever met. Her apartment is also very centrally located; you are right next to a bus stop and a few blocks from a metro. I would have paid three times more for an experience like this one. If you could stay anywhere in Athens, you should stay with Fotini and her adorable animals :)"

We were first greeted by Fotini with her pets Pablo and Tony, and with a nice homemade pie as well. Fotini gave us a map and showed us the scenic routes to take! She was lovely and ensured we had everything we needed. She let us use the washing machine at night, and let us leave our bags overnight when we went out of Athens for a day. The apartment is just a 20 minute walk away from the Acropolis (a good thing because it is not too near the crowded areas). There are many cafes and restaurants nearby the apartment, and it is really peaceful at night. We enjoyed the welcome home from Pablo and Tony every night and we looked forward to getting back."

She was super accommodating by letting us drop our luggage before check-in time. She gave us a couple suggestions on what to do and where to go for a walk.

We arrived tired after a week of travel and she welcomed us into her apartment with a home-cooked meal and cake. Yes, the room was very beautiful (and meticulously clean) with a private balcony and reasonable walking distance to the heart of Athens. But the best part of staying with Fotini was being able to experience a side of Greek culture and hospitality that many tourists never get to see. "

She was quick to reply to messages, provided accurate directions to get to her place. She welcomed me with homemade cheese cake and later on I tagged along with her to show me around the neighborhood. There is an university nearby so the crowd is lively and young. Fotini recommended places to eat and I had the best vegan gyro from one of those places. It is very cheap to eat around there. About a 10 minute walk to the train station but honestly Athens is so small I only took the subway once to get to the acropolis and I just walked everywhere. Best value for money and fotinis hospitality makes this place worth more!"

Fotini is so warm, and goes out of her way to make sure you feel comfortable and happy. The apartment is cosy and clean, and Pablo (pup) and Tony (kitty) bring a lively, light energy to the home. We were within walking distance to the centre and everything we needed. I had the best sleep of my life, the bed is a dream... Our stay was simply delightful. Thank you Fotini, we will meet again!"
14081186,453618439,2019-05-16,246518917,Archita,Our stay at Fotini's was wonderful and value for money. Most places you would want to visit in Athens are within walking distance. Fotini even gave us some wonderful directions to see the city. She made our stay very special with her sweet gestures like baking us a cheese pie and an orange cake. She also has two lovely pets - Pablo (pup) & Tony (cat)!
14081186,454397752,2019-05-18,113552697,Marc,"The apartment was a really nice place, and Fotini a very welcoming host. It's a good budget option for exploring the city but is a 10-20 minute walk from the centre, in a not-so-interesting neighbourhood."
14081186,455018177,2019-05-19,8225423,Emmanuel,"This was a great place to spend a quiet night in Athens. Fotini was very welcoming despite our late arrival, and was as helpful as a host can be.

The little balcony at the room is definitely a plus as you can let some fresh air into the room. The apartment is very well located, it's situated in a more local area. You can find a lot of cafés and bars in the area which is very convenient if you like to relax with a glass of wine after a long stroll through the city. Fotini is a very welcoming host, she is there whenever you need her. Pablo and Tony are also very cute, if you stay at Fotini's place you should not be scared with cats and dogs. If we come back to Athens, we would stay at Fotini's place again! Thank you very much for everything, take care! Georg and Katja"

Also, when we came back, she was making a special greek dinner, but since we had to wake up really early, she packed it for us for breakfast. It was delicious! She woke up with us only to go downstairs to get a taxi for us and give him directions. Her hospitality was unbelievable and we are forever grateful. <br/>Regarding the house, it’s a very clean apartment, and the bed was so comfy! She has a cute dog and a cat, and the location is really good, pretty central. We walked from there to the Acropolis, no problem.<br/><br/>It is an awesome value for money and I can assure you Fotini is an angel. Thank you for everything, we hope to see you soon!!!!"

She shared traditional Greek meals with me as she made recommendations on where to go and places to see. If you do stay with her (and you must), ask her to tell you how she met Pablo, her dog - it's the best love story I've ever heard. But the real boss of the house is the cat, Tony, who spent most of my stay ignoring me and wrestling Pablo!"

Fortini is super lovely and so are her pets - Pablo and Tony. She makes you feel warm staying there, and her place is very clean and comfortable, at a strategic convenient location in the city center, where you'll reach most key areas of Athens in 10-15min. I miss them a lot and if I ever come back again on my own, I'll stay with her and her furry children for sure : )"

You are in the middle of everything and you can literally walk everywhere 15-20min walk to Sytagana square, 10min to Archeological museum, 10-15 to Lycabettus hill, 15min to Benakis museum. Also the room is spacious, clean and the house feels very quiet-perfect for resting after more than 12hrs of sightseeing. <br/>Bathroom is also very convenient and well equipped.

Είναι ένα σπίτι με χρώματα και δύο πολύ όμορφα και καλόχαρα πλάσματα πολύ φιλικά κι αυτά όπως η Φωτεινή. Το σπίτι είναι σε πολύ πολύ βολικό σημείο και η τιμή δελεαστική σε σχέση με τη φιλοξενία που παρέχεται. Θα το προτιμήσω ξανά!"

Fotini provided everything we needed for our short trip - including breakfast/coffee, delicious homemade treats, great recommendations for the area, and help with figuring our our transportation. The area is great - the apartment is super close to a street full of great bars and restaurants away from the more touristy areas. Highly recommend this place!"
14081186,594698945,2020-01-19,287169118,Oliver,"Fotini is an incredibly kind, thoughtful and generous person. She kindly stayed up when I arrived late, provided helpful information about Athens and surrounds, and each day offered me delicious foods to try. Fotini’s dog, Pablo, and cat, Tony, are very friendly too and great company.<br/><br/>Fotini’s Airbnb is located in an interesting part of Athens, lively and diverse and only 30 mins walk from the Acropolis. In the neighbourhood are many cafes, bars, bookshops, and more. The room itself was homely and warm, the bed comfy. It is next to a reasonably busy road though, so if street noise tends to keep you awake at night I recommend bringing a pair of ear plugs."

14081186,609686568,2020-02-23,8049697,Kathy,"Hello! <br/><br/>I just spent almost 3 days at Fotin's place in Athens and here is what I can say. I highly recommend Fotin's place. Here are the reasons:<br/><br/>First and foremost: The place is near the center and you can walk around. No need for transportation really ;-)<br/>Second, the room is so clean and neat that you would feel like at home. So decorated with a good taste and Fotini keeps it clean. I for one like to live in a clean space and you can have it there.<br/>Third, I can carry on to more details but I will finish with the third which is last but not least, about our dearest Fotini. I travel a lot but I never had such a loving and caring Airbnb host like Fotini. On my arrival, she served me an amazing special greek soup and as for desert her delicious orange and chocolate cake. Do you know the feeling after a long day and travel and you just long for someone serving you a hot meal and hot bath? You can have that at Fotini's. Not only that, but also, she is a very good company. I enjoyed talking to her and listening to her story. Do you need tipps about what to see in Athens and how to get there and so on? She will provide you all information you need during your stay, with all the details needed. She is so helpful, friendly, quiet and smiling. Her cat Toni and dog Pablo add a charm to the place. But you don't need to worry about them because they are so friendly and quiet. If you are looking for a place to stay, don't look further. Book this place right now before anybody else does it and you will miss the greatest place to stay in Athens you can ever dream for! Thank you again for the great time Fotini and I hope to see you in Vienna one day an if I ever come back to Athens, I will definetely stay with you again if I may. Lots of love from Vienna!<br/><br/>Kathy"

Επιπλέον είναι εξαιρετική μεγίρας. <br/><br/>Το διαμέρισμα είναι cozy, σπιτικό και το υπνοδωμάτιο είναι τόσο άνετο με ένα ωραίο μπαλκόνι γεμάτο με φυτά.

14083122,90397840,2016-08-01,37230168,Troy,"UNBELIEVABLE VILLA MELITI.
<br/>Located in the trendy inner suburb of Kerimeikos on a leafy quite street amongst endless local cafes, bars and restaurants you get a true Athens taste. We were promptly contacted by Aristea and greeted at the villa itself by greek goddess Nandia who gave us a tour of the stunning villa and helpful local tips and recommendations to maximize our stay. Made up of 4 newly renovated bedrooms and massive living spaces, courtyards, kitchen (all brand new), dinning, lounges (7tvs in total) and the centre piece... indoor jet pool inside the living room!!! We never wanted to leave the villa although just 15min walk away is the Acropolis and down town area. Ideal for a group of friends or older families (stairs and pool not ideal for young kids). I'm already looking for an excuse to come back and visit Villa Meliti... #VillaIsBetterThanPhotos"
14083122,91692669,2016-08-06,42278083,Henry,"This house is just wonderful and Nhandia was available all the times. The next time I will come at Athènes I return at this home for sure !!!!
<br/>
<br/>"
14083122,96912611,2016-08-25,84215740,Jeremy,"We had a wonderful 4 night stay with 7 family members (including 5 kids ages 7-19). 
<br/>
<br/>The home is spectacular, from design to finish to space to amenities. Fabulous kitchen, delightful (unheated but that didn't matter in mid-August) pool, tons of space, very well appointed.
<br/>
<br/>Our hosts were very accommodating, helpful and responsive. They had helpful suggestions for sites to visit, for transportation, they promptly obtained transformers when requested, we were very very pleased.
<br/>
<br/>Full supermarket (open from 8:00 to 21:00) a block and half away.
<br/>Short walk to Metro and short walk to tourist areas.
<br/>
<br/>Important to note: 
<br/>1) The home is not for those with children who can not swim on their own, since the pool is, as advertised, right in the living room area, with no gate. 
<br/>2) There are a few beautifully designed spots in the home that at the same time could cause injury to a person if they were careless or irresponsible in their behavior. Examples: a bridge leading to the bathroom that overlooks the lower floor pool; massive waist high windows in the bathroom that can easily be opened and overlook the lower floor pool; a semi spiral staircase whose sole railing begins relatively high.
<br/>
<br/>The neighborhood is relatively run down, graffiti filled and not well lit at night, though this is not felt in the home and we did not feel unsafe.
<br/>
<br/>Assuming that the ages are appropriate for the group of guests, it is a gem."
14083122,97676311,2016-08-28,36052786,Nicolai,The perfect Place to stay. We were just amazed. The House was very big and very nice interial architecture. Very good equipped. Pool and terrace are amazing. Specially in the hot Summer of Athens it is very comfortable. The area around has very very good restaurants with good prices. And it is well placed. The hosts were amazing. Nandia did everything to make our stay at this place special. And it worked!<br/><br/>We would love to stay here again!!! It is the best Airbnb place all of us have ever been to. Sad to leave...<br/><br/>
14083122,101151967,2016-09-12,20230667,Ahmed Fawad,Our stay was a big success. The house is spacious and has every kind of equipment you would need - the pool and roof top terrace adds to the experience. I would highly recommend this place.<br/><br/>The house is close to great bars and restaurants. <br/><br/>Aristea and her collague were quick to get back to us when we needed them.
14083122,102354790,2016-09-17,75166970,Tom,"The girls that run Villa Meliti were fantastic both prior to our arrival (answering our queries such us sending us the address in Greek for the taxi driver) to arriving at the front door to a fabulous list of recommended restaurants, bars and apps available to download to make our trip to Athens as smooth and enjoyable as possible. The villa itself is stunning, really modern design with lots of thought put into every room. The swimming pool was so clean and clear, with jets that you can switch on should you wish to have a workout rather then a lesuirely dip. The upstairs terrace is fantastic to have a drink on in the evenings or breakfast al fresco. I particularly loved the touch of candles/ lanterns that could be lit on the terrace and living room areas. The Lighting was really well thought out across the villa and the kitchen was equipped with all the amenities you would need. Plenty of glasses, cups, plates etc if there was a larger group staying. The girls had even left plenty of espesso pods for the coffee maker, butter, honey and even some choices of cereal were left for the morning. The kitchen also comes with a dishwasher so if you do decide to eat in you dont need to worry about the washing up! The bathrooms were clean and we particularly loved the vintage style bath tub in the upstairs bathroom.  Overall the villa and the hosts were absolutely 5 star. Exactly what we needed a beautiful and relaxing few days away in a quiet area with great restaurants nearby and that is exactly what Villa Meliti gave us, thank you Anna and Nandia!"
14083122,103373813,2016-09-22,92067023,Peta,"Nandia was great. Very flexible and accomodating. We were snatched up by relatives so the time we said we would arrive changed, and even though we got in at midnight she was wonderful! The house was everything we expected, the kids had so much fun. It was very close to everything so we could make our way around easily."
14083122,108011905,2016-10-14,20078819,Ioannis,"Villa Meliti is the perfect place to stay in Athens. The house is spacious, well equipped and nicely decorated.

14083122,108464779,2016-10-16,6882863,Gavin,Great place to stay in Athens - very spacious flat which is well equipped and has a lovely pool and terrace. Great location near Gazi which is full of great restaurants and bars. Both Anna and Nandina were great hosts and were very accommodating about check-in / check-out times.

La maison est très grande, bien équipée, et correspond parfaitement à la description qui en est faite sur le site. Située à quelques minutes du métro et de nombreux restaurants et cafés, elle est aussi dans une petite rue très calme.
<br/>D'ici on peut facilement visiter le centre d'Athènes.
<br/>Très bonne remarque aussi sur l'accueil : des conseils, une bonne disponibilité pour avoir les clés et un bon arrangement pour le départ. 
<br/>Bref, un lieu qui donne envie d'y revenir. "

Grazie di tutto , quando sarò ad Atene ci tornerò sicuramente ! "
14083122,127318559,2017-01-17,92681217,Nikia,The villa was absolutely lovely. Exactly as pictured in the photos. Extremely clean. The host was attentive and responsive to all of my emails. Only downside is that the Wi-Fi would go in and out but I am told that is just how the internet is in Greece.  Anna arranged transport from the airport and the driver Spiros was wonderful. Only wished I spoke more Greek to communicate with him during the trips.  Within walking distance to a grocery store and other restaurants.  About 10 blocks to a metro station and an area with tons of bars. Overall a great stay.

Nous avons été très bien accueillis  par Anna. Le lieux est propre et il y a tout ce qu'il faut. La villa a  réellement été essentielle dans notre escapade entre amis. Nous nous sommes tous retrouvés sur la terrasse, avons pu plonger dans la piscine et surtout découvert le quartier le plus IN d'Athènes... brochettes exquise à deux pas jusqu'à 3h du matin ! génial !"

14083122,157909669,2017-06-05,119756249,Rima,The villa is very tastefully done. It is huge place in cosy neighbourhood of Athens.

Plus also two outdoor places for some fresh air and pool . Had a wonderful stay!!

14083122,161247292,2017-06-17,24797581,Kurt,"This is a wonderful home with all of the amenities. It is not ideal for families with very small children in that there are spiral staircases and walking bridges that can give new parents a good deal of anxiety. That said, the rooms are all perfectly sized with their own thermostat which accommodates each person's ""temperature needs"".  The kitchen is very functional and the proximity to a nice little bakery and grocery store was incredibly convenient. The neighborhood is funky and fun with many places that serve great food until late at night. Our host was incredibly responsive and polite. We really enjoyed our stay. "

14083122,169398781,2017-07-12,21818875,Rachel,The house was great and suited a group of 5 girls well. The communal areas are large with various nooks for extra space. The house is located in a funky neighborhood about 7min walk from the Kerameikos metro stop. There are loads of good cafes and restaurants nearby if you don't to venture into downtown Athens.  Nearby Flamme Rouge Cafe does a fabulous breakfast.<br/>The team made it all so easy to check in and out and they helped coordinate our transfers to and from airport/port.

Great location, fantastic amenities, and a warm, indoor pool right when you walk in the front door! Just what we needed after a long day out being tourists! The house is in a fun neighborhood too, with lots of arts, activities, coffee places and fancy restaurants all right nearby. Close to the subway as well. Very good place to stay."

The indoor pool is warm and clean. The place is pretty, very clean and well equipped with everything you need including great coffee ,milk, washing powder etc. The small terraces are very well kept with nice trees, possibility for shade etc. We explored all sites in Athens only by walking from the apartment. Especially thanks to the two ladies that took care of us. They answered their phones 24/7 and once sent help within 15 minutes when we forgot the key inside the apartment door (then you cant open from outside). We can really recommend this place. Best, Carl, Marie and kinds from Cape Town"

We were able to walk to the Acropolis and anywhere else we needed to go. We did not hear any street noise and enjoyed the rooftop deck (which is a bit perilous to climb up to if you are mobility-challenged, but worth it for the sunshine and view). Communication from the property manager was excellent and she provided great recommendations for our group of four couples in their thirties. "
14083122,216192101,2017-12-03,21566904,Or,The flat is very spacious with fun warm inside pool and lovely patios. Located right at the Gazi area and 15 minutes walk to Plaka

14083122,229891051,2018-01-26,84147646,Ronalyn,"Anna is an excellent hostess! She spent a lot of time with us explaining the city, and offering tourist suggestions that made our visit great. The home was okay. It was clean, but was in a very depressed neighborhood, and that made walking anywhere feel dangerous even though we were assured it was safe. Walking distances were good to a lot of eating, shopping, and the Acropolis. As Americans, we were not used to the bathing facilities in the bathroom. There was only one shower with a hand held shower head that was not designed to stay in the wall mount as it sprayed out all over the bathroom. The other bathroom was a tub with a hand held shower head. They were very awkward. Again, Anna was amazing!"

It's quiet and residential, yet if you walk up the street you are able to see all the joys of the city. It is walking distance from the metro, bars, restaurants and the best clubs I've been to period. The metro gets you to the the center, airport, restaurants, bars and clubs within minutes! The in home entertainment is superb. Strong wireless connection, cable, indoor clean pool etc. The roof top is a great touch to have and evening glass of wine or breakfast. If you are traveling from the States bring a converter, in order to charge your electronics. Both ladies are kind and understanding. Thanks Anna Nandia!"
14083122,249385798,2018-04-02,20288681,Katie,The house was perfect for two families and the kids adored the swimming pool.  The neighborhood is fine but a really easy walk to the main sites of Ancient Greece.  Anna/Nandia/Aristea went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and help us when we needed it.  Would definitely recommend this place.

14083122,252363254,2018-04-10,48752281,Chris,"Very nice house which worked really well for our party of 7 (two families). The kids really enjoyed the downstairs pool, and the terrace was ideal for meals and drinks. Everything was clean and well-appointed, including the kitchen which is large and well-stocked. The location is fine, with various local shops and a supermarket very close. (Be prepared for the graffiti etc in local streets - this is standard for Athens.) We tended to walk to the main historic sites, about 20-25 minutes. <br/><br/>The welcome from the hosts was perfect, with lots of advice and local tips, and communication ahead of time was great, despite our slightly confusing requirements. We were met at the airport by the company's 9-seater, which was super.<br/><br/>Small suggestions: maybe put a lock on the upstairs bathroom (we had two families staying) . And the bath seems to have hot and cold the wrong way round - it confused the first two of us to use it, until word got around!<br/><br/>A great stay, many thanks!"
14083122,254587830,2018-04-17,53836011,Andrew,"This is the place to stay in Athens. We had 6 of us in town for a few days and stumbled across this listing when planning - but we had no idea how great it would be!<br/><br/>The space itself is amazing. Mix of spacious indoor accommodations with great outdoor patios, and the indoor pool is awesome! <br/><br/>The team was so responsive and accommodating, with our host even hanging out for a while to give tips on the area - restaurants, clubs, great walking paths, etc. Urban Villas even arranged for airport transfer which took away any stress in getting there. <br/><br/>We are so glad we found this place and would love to book with Urban Villas again if and when we return!"
14083122,263888733,2018-05-13,67090264,Henrik,"Detta var ett helt underbart ställe. Detta är nog första gången bilderna var sämre än i verkligheten. Brukar alltid vara tvärtom. Underbar pool, stora utrymmen, 2 uteplatser plus takterassen som man får klättra i en stege till. Coolt med en bro över poolen på övervåningen som går till badrummet. Sköna detaljer och alla bekvämligheter finns. Området är helt ok med nära till en populär nattklubb men det är nära till stan och acropolis. Perfekt ställe för familjer och företag. Kommer gärna tillbaka till detta ställe. Snabba svar från värdinnan och allt klaffade klockrent med nyckelöverlämning och även den taxin som var bokad via värdinnan. Så skönt!"
14083122,284734752,2018-07-02,13543068,Manu,Perfect place for a stay in Athens.  Close to all touristy things as well as local bars/restaurants.  Alexandra helped us with local tips/suggestions.  The pool is as amazing as it looks!

14083122,290745524,2018-07-15,110262800,Nicola,"Take note AirBnb hosts!! This is how you run a property. It starts from the punctual and precise pick up and drop off to and from the airport. Aristra then provides you with a thorough and warm introduction to the local area and wider Athens. She responds to all queries very promptly. The property itself is outstanding. An inside pool to cool<br/>Off after a long day seeing the history of Athens, of course shopping in between. Space perfect for a family. There were 7 in our party, 3 adults 4 children and the room was aplenty. TV in every room, not that it was used but there. Cold Air conditioning. Large kitchen. Comfortable beds. Clean linen! Surrounded by lovely traditional Greek cafes and bars. Awesome all round! The Greek gods would be impressed! <br/>Yasou!!"
14083122,293305041,2018-07-20,159075282,Synthia,"The villa hosted our family of 8 very well.  More room then what the pictures show.  Great location, anything you need within working distance and getting a taxi was the way to get around to city center with 4 in each taxi.  We had an issue with toilet but she sent somebody over quickly and took care of the issue.  They were great to work with.<br/>This was our first visit to Greece and if we ever get the opportunity to come back <br/>we would love to stay at your villa again.  We highly recommend it. <br/>"

14083122,298958921,2018-07-30,63370629,Miranda,House is an architectural marvel. Lots of great details!  Traveling with a child really had us appreciating the indoor pool!  It was great for her to be able to swim while we visited in the living room. She was part of the action!  <br/><br/>Overall we greatly enjoyed our stay and would absolutely rent here again. 
14083122,304164311,2018-08-09,21324379,Willy,Très belle villa avec différents espaces <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
14083122,305901494,2018-08-12,162130425,Daniel,Superbe maison. Dans un quartier ordinaire mais pas très loin des quartiers à visiter.
14083122,312672241,2018-08-24,127030124,Pierre,Very nice stay. 1 metro station from the Center. Very quiet.
14083122,317329915,2018-09-02,169963390,Steven,"Fantastic apartment! Very modern and stylish, and accommodated the five of us very well. The pool and patio were great bonuses that really enhanced our experience. Anna's team was responsive and helpful. The only ""negative"" thing we experienced was that the shower had very little hot water, and the pool was a little chilly so you couldn't be in there for a long time. All things equal, we highly recommend this property and would gladly stay here again!"
14083122,320065588,2018-09-08,161158092,Jacqui,Athens was a wonderful cultural experience. The villa was beautiful and much more impressive than we expected. The area is quiet but within easy walking distance. Our hosts were wonderful. Thank you :)
14083122,321327188,2018-09-10,15212742,Make-A-Wish,Truly amazing house!<br/>Thank you so much. The family loved it!
14083122,329958407,2018-09-30,20966930,Martin,"We stayed with 3 couples in Villa Meliti from Sept 27 - 30 and really enjoyed the experience. Large villa with 2 bedrooms in the downstairs area and 2 bedrooms at the upper level. Downstairs launch TV area with indoor pool leading to outdoor patio. Upper area is the main kitchen area and both bedrooms are linked to an outdoor seating area for breakfast or evening drinks. Location is slightly outside the city center, but the subway station is in walking distance. Only 2 stops away from the main square in the city center.  Walking is also an option. Supermarket and bakery in close proximity to stock up the fridge. Upon arrival our host arranged pick-up from the airport to the villa. She explained and showed us around the villa. Pretty simple and worked out very well for us. On departure day we had the flexibility to leave the villa slightly later due the fact that no other guests rented the villa. We also used the transportation arranged by our host to return to the airport. Recommend the place if you are planning to travel with a group of 6 - 8 people and if you don’t mind to walk or use the subway to get around and explore Athens."
14083122,334496314,2018-10-09,9251355,JiaJia,"This centrally located Athens Villa was one of my favorite Airbnbs ever! The house is on a quiet cute street close to cute shops and the Acropolis within walking distance. The villa is enormous, therefore excellent for groups, and pool/tub are next level. We had the best time!"
14083122,348544283,2018-11-14,174527682,Sébastien,super logement proche métro ou découverte à pied <br/>très confortable
14083122,362045460,2018-12-25,1518309,Taisha,"We rented out this incredible home for a two days over Christmas and couldn't have been happier.  In the middle of a long tour performing all over Europe and far away from home for Christmas, this was the perfect spot to call home, and to fill with food, decorations, presents and love.  The pool was a tiny bit cold for mid winter, but we still used it and I can imagine it's the perfectly refreshing as soon as it's a little warmer outside -- the terraces in the sun also must be perfect in the warmer months, we still brought our tea up to watch the sunset and did some yoga up there in December.  <br/><br/>All the basic amenities were perfect, and the kitchen had everything we needed to do a feast for 8, and many many loads of laundry. Everything was incredibly clean, and Alexandra, who did our check-in, had tons of suggestions for local spots.  It was so nice to feel like we were in a real neighbourhood, a tinsy bit away from the tourist-filled craziness of Plaka or the Acropolis, but with easy access to the metro and grocery stores and bakeries just around the block.  <br/><br/>Thank you thank you, it was everything we wished for and more."
14083122,413261563,2019-02-17,31360559,Scott,Fantastic open plan apartment in the centre of Athens.
14083122,425431265,2019-03-18,5399822,Ira,"Great place, very roomy and comfortable, lots of light, nice big kitchen, great location, very comfortable beds. Host Aristea was so helpful and attentive."
14083122,427730796,2019-03-24,5183907,Anders,"Really nice location in Athens if you are not interested in staying right in the middle of all the tourist hustling. We spent a lot of time in the neighbourhood at restaurants, bars and cafes as we just found the overall level higher than in the central touristy part. <br/><br/>Overall the apartment was great and had everything we needed."
14083122,430895547,2019-03-31,11872885,Frank,"It was the second time that we stayed at this house. So highly recommended. Good, quite place to explore the city."
14083122,434989307,2019-04-09,93596560,Matthias,"Ich kann nur jedem einen Aufenthalt bei Urban Villas empfehlen, die Kommunikation ist sehr gut, man bekommt in kürzester Zeit eine Antwort. Unser Flug wurde um 12 Stunden verschoben, ohne Probleme wurde der Transfer und der Check in geändert.<br/><br/>Das Haus ist wirklich ein Traum, wir haben uns alle sehr wohl gefühlt. Es sieht noch fast besser als auf den Fotos aus. <br/><br/>Die Lage des Hauses ist super, man ist zu Fuß in 10 Minuten in der Altstadt, in der näheren Umgebung sind viele Bars und Restaurants.<br/><br/>Kommt in diese tolle Stadt, und kommt zu Urban Villas."
14083122,436968926,2019-04-14,26495222,Claire,"We enjoyed the location of the villa - so easy to walk to all the sites, and a great bakery just around the corner. Lots of bars and restaurants locally too. Unfortunately the villa needs a little tlc in some areas, although we found the beds comfortable and the shared spaces good too."
14083122,455795281,2019-05-20,62503837,Colleen,"We stayed here for our first trip to Athens and we were incredibly impressed. The house is beautiful. The bedrooms are comfortable. The kitchen, dining room, and living room were all big enough to accommodate all 6 of us very comfortably. And the pool is incredible. We first thought we would have to use public transportation or a rental car to get around, but you can easily walk to everything including all of the major sights in Athens. There are several fantastic restaurants and cafes within just one or two blocks of the villa offering everything you could possibly imagine and they are all open until 1 or 2am. There’s also a grocery store within a few blocks that has everything you could possibly need for your stay. I really can’t recommend this place enough. If we ever come back, we will definitely be booking Villa Meliti again."
14083122,459285443,2019-05-27,20698834,Jan-Peter,We stayed with six persons and loved it. very spacey place. Enough rooms and the indoor pool was extra special. Everything within walking distance. We didnt used the metro. We would recommend this place!!
14083122,460397715,2019-05-29,9657104,Karri,We had a great stay at the villa. The host gave us a really good tip with the Beat app for getting around. Amazing place to stay in Athens.
14083122,468686131,2019-06-13,134849320,Chelsea,"We absolutely loved this villa so much! A group of 7 of us (family and friends) spent a few nights here while visiting Athens, and it was the absolute perfect spot. Christianna was SO welcoming, informative, and helpful both during check in and throughout or stay for any questions we had about the space or about our vacation in general. The villa was amazing, it was clean and beautifully decorated, the pool was such an awesome addition and we used it so much, the kitchen was full of amenities, the outside spaces were great, and it was walking distance from so many things (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) We totally loved this space and were so sad to leave! We would highly recommend staying here to anyone visiting Athens!"
14083122,473108547,2019-06-21,11401774,PAIGE And ANDY,"The space was wonderful and Aristea was so thoughtful to take time with us and to help us book dinner reservations, suggest places to go and to arrange a ride for our group to the port for our next adventure. We enjoyed the indoor pool, the full kitchen and all the fun places and restaurants that were in walking distance. The house was clean and we would definitely go back!"
14083122,483163580,2019-07-07,12487000,Jenine,Perfect family Villa!  Excellent amenities and high quality service! Very good location! Cannot recommend highly enough! Thank you so much for hosting us and making our Athens stay so wonderful!
14083122,485038519,2019-07-10,19163127,Kayla,Excellent team! They planned wonderful dinner and excursions for us and made travel very easy. Would recommend!
14083122,487585194,2019-07-14,31238173,Esther,"This is a fabulous place to stay! We walked each day to places of interest, it is surrounded by charming places to eat and the indoor pool is a god send for evening dips and morning chill outs. The space is modern and fun, the kitchen well equipped and there was plenty of space for us all. Highly recommended."
14083122,489583469,2019-07-17,39575591,Kathryn,"We (family of four - 2 adults and 2 children, aged 7 and 9) stayed at this house for three nights in July 2019. It’s huge, and could easily accommodate two families, especially with multiple living areas and courtyards. <br/><br/>The house was beautifully furnished, and we appreciated the amenities, especially the washing machine and coffee maker. The kitchen was fully equipped and you could easily stay for a few weeks and find everything you need. <br/><br/>The pool was a huge hit for all of us, especially in the afternoons, after we had spent our days discovering Athens historical sites in the heat. Our only issue was on our second last day, there must have been a dump of chlorine in it, and we all felt the effects of this with red eyes, and hay fever-like symptoms. <br/><br/>We loved the location of the house. Two metro stations were within an easy walk (5-10 mins), and you felt like you were eating with locals at the nearby cafes, rather than with tourists. The bakery around the corner (on Meg Alexandrou) was perfect for breakfast supplies, and Elvis (corner Plateon and Meg Alexandrou) did fantastic souvlaki. <br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay at the villa and would recommend it for anyone visiting Athens, who wants a beautiful house to stay in, within an authentic Athens neighborhood."
14083122,499954855,2019-08-01,5884777,Angela,"Villa Meliti was spacious, clean, and thoughtfully designed.    The beds were extremely comfortable.    It was the perfect base to explore Athens and had many wonderful restaurants within blocks.     The Urban Villas team was extremely helpful with transport and suggestions.    We would highly recommend this apartment and location if you are visiting Athens!"
14083122,503493898,2019-08-06,75809739,Erika,"We liked the artsy off the beaten path location of the villa. Cute local restaurants and coffee shops without many tourists. We were able to walk everywhere. The villa itself was very spacious and looked just like the photos. We had control over air conditioning which was a big plus, and it had a nice big kitchen."
14083122,508595876,2019-08-13,29340808,Caroline,"Une petite déception quant aux prestations, rideaux occultants décrochés, prises électriques défectueuses, joints pas nets, déco en bois un peu sombre, piscine pas chauffée donc très froide, ( bien juste pour les jambes en rentrant des balades à Athènes en août !). <br/>Mais accueil et échanges avec Alexandra irréprochables, pour les adresses, la gestion des bagages et le transfert à l’aéroport."
14083122,512083929,2019-08-18,1035410,David,Nice place and perfect location for a bigger group! Perfect and uncomplicated communication. Thank you for all

14083122,537702323,2019-09-29,11138686,Anna,"Great location! We walked no more than 25 minutes to get to Plaka and some great restaurants! Honestly the location is what makes it. The pool is really great but its cold! No heater. Great communication, they were quick to answer our questions and texts and very thorough during our welcome."
14083122,540896763,2019-10-04,203045542,Michael,"The town-villa is very nice. Especially the architecture of the house is special with the pool inside the open living room and the  bridge to the bathroom.<br/><br/>The Team is very friendly, reliable and the communication worked perfectly well."
14083122,542090115,2019-10-06,1770217,Daniel,"We booked a two night stay for 6 persons at this villa, and we were super satisfied! The villa is located centrally and has a walking distance to most places you will probably want to see while being in Athens. The villa looks good on the pictures, but we were actually positively surprised that it looked even better in reality. Very good overall standard in the villa from beds, to the kitchen, and the bathrooms. I warmly recommend everyone who is travelling to Athens to consider your stay here. The Urban Villa team also responded quickly before arrival and while being in Athens. 5 stars! :)"
14083122,547427754,2019-10-15,242473259,Martin,"A friendly, warm welcome, good local advice"

14083122,583711643,2019-12-29,246642693,Marvin,"This place was exactly as advertised and pictured.  The host , Alexandra, was extremely helpful and punctual.  It is a wonderful place to stay and a safe walking distance to most of the great sites of Athens, which includes the Acropolis and Plaka.  It is well decorated and had everything we needed for our week long stay.  We spent one of our days just enjoying the villa and all of its accommodations on Christmas Day.  We were able to prepare our Christmas meal while lounging around in our pajamas all day, and then later enjoyed time in the swimming pool, which was like being in a warm bath with available jacuzzi-like jets on one end. Each room was equipped with heat/air condition units; therefore, everyone could set a temperature according to their comfort.  The neighborhood was nice with several restaurants and a very nice bakery  nearby.  Coming for the U.S., the only suggestion we have is to make sure you get instructions on the microwave, stove and dishwasher from the host when you arrive.  They are totally different from what we were accustomed; however, once we figured them out, they worked great.  We would also suggest using the offered transportation service if you are coming in from the airport; especially, if you have a large group with a lot of luggage.  It is an eight passenger van with plenty of room for luggage.  It is very nice and clean, reasonably priced and the driver is very punctual and professional.  When we return, we will definitely look to book here again."

Very spacious and warm and had lots of kitchen space! <br/><br/>Nandia was lovely and gave us some great tips on the area and where to eat! <br/><br/>Would recommend 100%! Especially for large groups who want their space!
14083122,700360309,2020-10-14,213080815,Cassandra,"An amazing house for a group who want a weekend in Athens. Ideally located in the area of Gazi, close to lots of great bars and cafes this house is really cool and a a lot  of fun. Nadia, who checked us in, was really helpful and shared some great tips on where to eat. Not that you need it though as there is so much to choose from right on your door step. Having the pool was fun and you have ample space. We would definitely come back with more friends during our next visit to Athens."
14083122,702279559,2020-10-20,159622818,Katharine,"So much style and so much space in this great Athens AirBnB.  The pool in the living room was fantastic for the kids!  TVs and A/c units in every room. Definitely go to the bakery around the corner!  It opens every morning at 6am and is just amazing.  Even open Sundays!  You can walk to tourist attractions, but taxis are super easy and max 5 euros each way.  Fantastic communication throughout."

The Villa is clean,  in a quiet neighborhood, and walking distance to all the tourist areas."

The indoor pool is an awesome feature and the house has ample room for all it's guests. I can't wait to come back! Thank you so much for everything =)
14083122,407675742483394913,2021-07-16,179893258,Mchelle,The flat was great. Very clean and comfortable. It was very hot during our stat so the pool was great to have after touring. The location is in a trendy area a solid 10 min walk to the main attractions. The people who run the flat are very helpful and responsive.
14083122,413516075212937133,2021-07-24,76349306,Adam,"Absolutely better than advertised! Loved the amenities, and outdoor space (especially the pool!).<br/><br/>Would highly recommend staying here to any of my friends/family!"
14083122,425766252870753255,2021-08-10,108606723,Anne-Louise,"Our stay was great and Alexandra from Urban villas was a very attentive and super reactive host. The villa was as described but a little older/run down than it seems on the pictures (gas stove or swim jets in the pool not functional), some details  were missed in the preparation (several light bulbs missing - apparently due to previous renters using it as a TV set and removing them for lighting issues) and the kitchen equipment is basic (don't plan for a great cookout :). But overall we had a great stay. In the summer heat, the key things like AC worked perfectly, the pool was refreshing. The place has easy access to the center of town and monuments by public transport, taxi or even walking, the neighborhood is funky, though run down in places (though that's part of its charm) with great places to eat or have a drink, and Alexandra our host was really great, perfect communication, great resto suggestions, super responsive to all our questions throughout our stay."
14083122,427281068707938064,2021-08-12,246875576,Cynthia,"Very warm and punctual welcome! We booked the taxi with Alexandra and we were very satisfied by her reactivity and the punctuality of the driver. The van waited for us despite the 1 hour delay of the ferry. Very comfy with AC <br/>much needed in August!<br/> Great to have the swimming pool! The villa is nice, next to a good bakery and not too far from the old part of the city. The neighboorhood is fine until 8pm but not so safe beyond that time. Taxi recommended but affordable. <br/>In a nutshell, great advantage to gave the swimming pool. We had a great stay!"

14083122,438123846898504261,2021-08-27,211318,Martin,"An absolute gem in an incredibly vibrant neighbourhood of Athens. If you are looking for a hip, edgy, creative area, this is the best house to enjoy it, with the swimming pool a massive bonus to decompress after a hot day of wandering around. I would go back in a heartbeat!"
14083122,440992238713305349,2021-08-31,30268885,Najeeb,expect to be surprised how large this place is. very accommodating for a large group

Cabs and ubers were easy to get and Nadia was sooo helpful! She helped us arrange transfers from the airport and to the port the day we left. Can’t thank her enough! Definitely recommend."

Very responsive to all our inquires including helping with some pre-arrival groceries. The neighborhood is fun, lots of bars and restaurants in very close proximity and close to metro. Beautiful house with lots of storage and the pool was a big bonus. Two bathrooms, one of which is a tub with nozzle spray hose only.  Really enjoyed staying here!"

14090362,92322239,2016-08-08,18094634,Rebecca,Très belle accueil de nos hôtes. Nous sommes ravis de notre séjour dans ce bel appartement très bien situé dans le centre d'Athènes. Nous avons pu faire toutes nos visites à pied. A deux pas du centre animé et pourtant nous sommes au calme. La terrasse est un vrai plus! Nous recommandons vivement! 
14090362,93590623,2016-08-13,24420097,Cristina,"I spent two nights in Athens, at Anna and Effi's apartment and I must say everything was great! Most of all the apartment's location was fantastic, a few minutes away from Syntagma square, right off the main shopping street and surrounded by nice cafes and restaurants. Also very close if you want to visit the Acropolis. The apartment itself was spacious, we were three but it can accommodate 4-5 people. And the terrace on top  of the building was great, with a very nice view of the Acropolis. Finally,Anna and Effi were great hosts, everything was perfect, they even arranged the transfer for us from Athens with a very nice taxi driver. Definitely when I will come back to Athens I will try again to book Anna and Effi's place."
14090362,97381209,2016-08-27,8005291,Klaas,"Upon arrival, we were welcomed by a friend of Anna & Efi. She explained everything well. Also, Anna & Efi prepared a wonderful little guide which was very useful during our stay.
<br/>The apartment is extremely well located, within walking distance of all major attractions in Athens center. Although the apartment itself is in a quiet street, the area is lively with restaurants and bars just around the corner.
<br/>The apartment is just as described: it's cosy and comfortable and we liked the overall design and functionality.
<br/>We didn't use the terrace because of the summer heat but I imagine it being nice when it's not so hot.
<br/>I would definitely recommend staying at Anna & Efi's place."

The rooftop patio is gorgeous, with views of the acropolis, nice seating and umbrellas. The full kitchen and wash machine were all quite nice. Plenty of room for the three of us. I would highly recommend staying here!"
14090362,102833743,2016-09-19,47452706,Lucinda,"Anna & Efi are great hosts and go out of their way to be helpful. The communication was quick, friendly and they answered my questions fully each time I contacted them. The apartment is ideally located, super close to the metro station and just off the very lively Monastiraki Square. It is beautifully decorated and a lovely space to spend time in with everything that I needed. The roof terrace with a view to the Acropolis finished it off nicely! Definitely recommend."
14090362,103188053,2016-09-21,2330147,Adam,The apartment was as lovely as the pictures and brilliantly located. In the middle of everything but still quiet at night. Efi was a great host and responded quickly to any queries - even when we locked ourselves out! Would definitely recommend a stay here.
14090362,104052335,2016-09-25,24016976,Al,"Efi was extremely responsive throughout the booking process as well as the stay. Something for all people considering staying at this accommodation: YOU CANNOT BEAT THIS LOCATION! The apartment is smack dab in the middle of Syndagma, Monasiraki, and Acropolis. Not to mention is it a stones throw away from the best shops, restaurants or Plaka, and a short walk to all the best bars, clubs, nightlife in Gazi. If you plan on hitting all the tourist sites while having an upscale great time as well, you would be making a huge mistake staying anywhere but this listing...Not to mention Efi and Anna are SUPERHOSTS, the apartment is stunningly big and nice (which suites well to visitors from the West) and you have a rooftop terrace with STUNNING view of the Acropolis to your disposal. I will undoubtedly be staying in this unit again in the future.."
14090362,105257309,2016-10-01,80293853,Stavroulla & Alkiviadis,The most amazing hosts! Although our stay was short we really felt that it was our home away from home. It was exactly as shown in the pictures and we would definitely  recommend it. Thank you Efi and Anna for making it so easy! 
14090362,106455149,2016-10-06,31475264,Xiaoxiao,"在出发前往雅典之前,房东已经详细地介绍了怎样从机场去目的地,对于我们的疑问也非常耐心地解答了｡抵达当天房东在楼下迎接了我们~房间内设施和照片上展示的一样,并且我们特别喜欢楼顶那个可以看见卫城的露台｡公寓的地理位置特别方便,位于宪法广场和普拉卡地区的中间,步行可以抵达大多数的热门景点(我们最远走到了狼山去看日落),附近的街区白天晚上都十分热闹,因此我们也感觉很安全｡房东耐心而且及时地解答了我后来问的许多关于吃喝玩乐的问题,我们相处十分融洽｡"
14090362,109080145,2016-10-19,1576736,Christine,"Our stay was perfect, we had a horribly delayed flight but Anna & Efi were very helpful and made sure we could still get access to the apartment even though we didn't get in til after midnight.  They left a great book of suggestions for us which included a 24 hour burger bar - which definitely helped that first night. We also tried out many of the suggestions over our stay and they were all great!   As for the apartment itself, it is as pictured and was very comfortable. The location is amazing, being so close to all the main sites of Athens, and it is surrounded by great eateries, cafes and bars.  We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place for sure!"

Her communication prior to arrival was fantastic and her instructions for getting from the airport to the front door were so helpful.  We tried many of their restaurant recommendations (in the guidebook they provided) and had excellent meals.  We enjoyed nights on the roof terrace sipping wine and enjoying the fantastic view of the Acropolis.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the apartment had everything we needed.  When we return to Athens in the future, we would definitely look to stay here again!  Thank you Anna & Efi!!"

Our taxi driver tried to make us pay much more than what was written on the taxi meter. And he gave us the change with counterfeit money... <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the apartment is very well located. It enabled us to enjoy our time, not being in a rush. The information provided before and during the journey were clear and helpful. The contact with Efi was pleasant. We deeply appreciated our time in Athenis!"

And Efi was kind enough to email us to let us know we could have early check in as our flight was arriving early that morning.   Efi met us when we arrived to the apartment, and she thoroughly went over everything.  The apartment was just as seen in the pictures and description and better.  Large and open with windows and a beautiful terrace view of the Acropolis.  Extremely clean, essential items stocked and not lacking for anything.  The location was right in the middle of town and within walking distance to everything.   We would never consider staying anywhere else.  Perfect for our family of four.  Thank you so much Anna and Efi! "

Le logement est très bien situé et nous avons pu faire toutes nos visites à pied. L'appartement est très propre et calme car il donne sur une petite rue piétonne.

The location of the place is phenomenal; the view from the terrace is also phenomenal (once we did a picnic looking over the Acropolis hill) -- very close to restaurants, cafes, transport and all that! Will definitely come back. :)"

Anna was there to kindly welcome us and provided us with some valuable tips for Athens. The flat itself is exactly as shown in the pictures, extremely clean, it has all the home appliances needed, very comfortable bed and nice shower. A big plus for me was that the apartment is fully air conditioned as Athens in August gets quite warm. Location wise, terrific. Just one street behind the main shopping area, nearby the metro station and main sightseeing. We did everything by foot, everything is walking distance. If I am ever going back to Athens, I would not hesitate to stay at Anna's place again."

Lots of space (enough for 2 people for a long-ish stay), comfortable beds. Fabulously clean. Laundry room upstairs, in case you need to use it. Extremely clear instructions on how to use everything, and how to get everywhere. I stayed here in two legs of a larger Greece trip, and don't regret having re-booked the accommodation twice at all. Loved this stay, and if I ever return to Athens, would love to come back here!"

Truly, our stay at Anna and Efi’s was a 5 star experience on every level. The space is exactly as pictured, spacious, clean, safe. We loved the location— just far enough away from the super busy tourist strips to be a bit more subdued but close enough to walk there in 5-10 mins. Very close to all the major hot spots and really great restaurants. Definitely try the pies at Fillo, anything at Cherchez La Femme, or Just Made 33. And that Acropolis view from the roof terrace! It really is stunning lit up at night. Anna answered all of our texts within 10 mins. Their driver, Lazarus, is incredibly friendly and gives you a “cab tour” as he drives, with tons of tips. Don’t even hesitate to book with Anna & Efi— you will not be disappointed."

Leur appartement est très propre, spacieux, lumineux et décoré simplement mais joliment.

Sa terrasse sur le toit offre une vue superbe sur l'Acropole, nous avons beaucoup aimé y prendre nos repas le soir.<br/>Anna nous avait proposé de nous réserver le taxi pour notre arrivée à l'aéroport, ce qui s'est avéré très pratique avec les enfants. Elle nous a ensuite accueilli très gentiment, avec plusieurs recommandations de restaurants classés par quartier, et avait même installé un lit bébé pour notre fils.

Nous avons même eu le droit à une livraison de raisins directement du marché local. <br/>Stationnement payant à moins de 50 mètres. 8 Euros la nuit. Très pratique quand vous avez une voiture."

Apartment is clean, big, centrally located, offers all amenities and few mins walk to everything. It comes with a great view of Acropolis from the roof. Their prompt replies to every query is what makes them a great host. I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to stay near acropolis/plaka and have a great time."

14090362,326781898,2018-09-23,35350294,Alice,I would gladly recommend this apartment and it’s hosts to everyone traveling to Athens! It was our first time here and we couldn’t have stayed in a better spot. The apartment is located on a quiet street a minutes (not even that) walk away from the main shopping strip/restaurants/bars. We were so central to everywhere we didn’t need to catch a taxi once. We were traveling with our 11 months old and were provided with a cot and high chair. We were met at the airport by a driver who took us directly to the apartment where we were met by the host who showed us around the apartment and gave us a booklet on local recommendations which was fantastic. Thank you very much for making our first visit to Athens a comfortable and pleasant one. You have such a beautiful apartment and should be very proud! Thank you again
14090362,329499163,2018-09-29,39621784,Judy,No thanks.

We didn't have any trouble sleeping at night. If you are looking for an area with lots of action, this is the spot.

When we needed any assistance they were quick to respond and solve any issues. we knew our baggage would be overweight as we bought a wooden painting - Anna found a shop for a luggage scale, went and bought it on her own time while we were out and it was waiting for us upon our arrival. I would have never expected this type of outstanding service and I am absolutely beyond words for how satisfied i am with her as a host.  Above and beyond - truely.

We would probably come again to this place, given the great location and the overall ""ok"" standard. (First time in Greece, maybe this is the standard here - I am comparing to previous experiences in Spain, Italy, Portugal, ...)<br/><br/>Yet, the overall condition was a negative surprise at arrival, as you do not see the little details in the pictures and none of the other reviews mentions any issues with a word. <br/><br/>Some things were a bit broken (e.g. loose water tap, some handles in the bathroom, a ceiling lamp), some parts a bit dirty (e.g. mould in corners of the shower). The host explained, that nobody ever complained about these things before and she sent in a craftsmen the same day to fix the things. (Big compliment for this prompt service!) - I would still recommend a proper inspection from time to time."
14090362,462756758443944507,2021-09-30,225106656,Tyler,"The place is huge and is a lot bigger then the pictures. It was super clean, well equipped, the rooftop had an incredible view, the laundry room is clean and easily accessible, and the hosts were kind and responsive. I highly recommend this place and have every intention of staying here again when I visit Athens!"

14092230,100398656,2016-09-09,36123388,Ophelie,"Andreas was a very welcoming host, who made us feel comfortable from the beginning. He provided us with everything we needed for our stay, including very helpful tips. He's a really nice and interested person.
<br/>The room is simple but in a good way, it was bright and very comfortable for 2 people. The rest of the apartment is equally charming with lots of art and plants. The location is good, close to Exarchia square. The metro station is a 20min walk though."
14092230,130191934,2017-02-05,90913075,Queenie,"Andreas has been a really nice host. He did his best to make me feel like at home. He recommend me to several good places to go (art spaces, bars, restaurants..) The room was clean and the bed comfortable .<br/>The neighbourhood is really dynamic and perfect for nightlife. I would recommand this appartement to young party people! "
14092230,136054869,2017-03-08,35000493,Serhii,"Andreas is a great host. He helped us a lot: consulted us about public transport and how we can get from/to airport, suggested good places to eat, printed our tickets and allowed us to check out at any time we want. <br/>The apartment is budget, but there is everything you need for comfortable stay. There is quite cheap supermarket just in 1 minute from the apartment. <br/>I definitely recommend to stay in Andreas place."

14092270,202834719,2017-10-13,12964258,Anny,"The experience of staying in Leon's place was absolutely amazing. We stayed in Athens for 3 months and lived in so many different apartments. Fortunately for us, we found Leon's place and just fell in love with this amazing spacious bright and cozy apartment. We stayed there for almost a month and didn't want to leave, because this flat is pure magic. <br/><br/>First of all you have amazing view to Acropolis and Likavitos from a spacious terrace that you can have lunch on, from other balconies you can see the whole city of Athens, bit of sea, watch sunset and sunrise ♥️♥️♥️ <br/>The flat was super clean and all linens and towels smelled fresh. <br/>The flat is new and fully equipped to live even for a long time, like we did. <br/>Communication with Leon was very fast and easy. As I understood friends of Leon are taking care of the apartment, they are amazing and easy going people always ready to help. They met us to show the apartment and give the keys.<br/>We also met before to see that apartment is ok, because we wanted to rent it for quite a long period and it worked out just perfect.<br/><br/>The bedroom. This is probably my dream bedroom. Wooden floor and ceiling, amazing orthopedic mattress, windows with a view, the softest cotton linens... All decorated in bright colors, looks and feels just fantastic. Lavender smeller in the wardrobe <br/><br/>There is a metro station 2 minutes walking from the apartment. There are also supermarkets, 24 hour ""ok"" shop and backery nearby. I liked the neighborhood.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I just want to thank Leon for the apartment like this. It made our Greek experience so awesome. I wish we could stay in your place once again when we decide to visit Athens again.<br/><br/>Efxaristoume poly!"
14092270,237277364,2018-02-22,7874373,Valentina,"Квартира полностью соответствует описанию: светлая, комфортная, элегантная. Масса полотенец и чистота везде. Плюс, действительно, на кухне посуды и всяческих принадлежностей с избытком (но! нет микроволновки, зато есть соковыжималка, что при таком обилии цитрусовых немаловажно), в ванной также можно найти всякую полезную мелочевку. Великолепный огромный балкон-терасса, на котором, будь теплее, мы бы обязательно завтракали. И 2 других небольших балкона в жаркое время тоже будут спасать от перегрева - квартира может продуваться насквозь. Квартира легко нагревается кондиционерами.<br/>На все наши вопросы мгновенно отзывались, приходили буквально через 5 минут (однажды даже в 12 ночи, учитывая, что мы просто сглупили и не разобрались с кондиционером :)).<br/>До метро, действительно, 2 минуты пешком, у метро стоит лоток с фруктами, где мы в феврале покупали свежую клубнику, а в соседний дом сын бегал утром за свежим хлебом.<br/>Всячески рекомендую квартиру и спасибо большое за приятный и комфортный отдых."

14092270,439982549,2019-04-20,132662889,Leonor,"The apartment is perfect, the views are impressive, it is very well connected, it only takes 15 minutes to get to the center of Athens by metro. The only problem is that the front door does not open properly and we had to call the neighbors to open it. Otherwise all great."
14092270,464607909,2019-06-06,249325138,Aphrodite,"Everything about our stay was wonderful. The apartment was impeccably maintained, homey and comfortable. <br/>Mr. Leon and his local host Panos were most helpful and made themselves available at all times. Mr. Leon actually communicated with us even before our stay to make sure that our expectations would be met.<br/>The view was incredible and the location, close to the metro, was ideal, a quiet neighborhood but very accessible to downtown. <br/>We hope to stay at this property during future trips to Athens."

14102785,97164712,2016-08-26,19948374,Cleon,"A lovely home with lovely hosts. One couldn't get a more central and convenient location. Evangelia and Christos were so welcoming and friendly.  They organised a quick and better-priced taxi from and to the airport, and they were waiting for our arrival at their amazing house. We chatted in their beautiful courtyard over some freshly-made Greek coffee that they kindly made for us. the house is beautifully designed and decorated. We thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would definitely stay there again. We highly recommend it. Thank you Evangelia and Christos"
14102785,99253384,2016-09-04,10321977,Amalia,"This is the best street in the best area in all of Athens. The house is beautiful, modern, clean and confortable. The view of the Acropolis from the terrace is unbelievable. Warning: the bathroom is small, tiny! Like airplane tiny"

Vista splendida sulle mura dell'Acropoli, a pochi passi dallo stesso Museo. Contatti ed accoglienza di Evangelia e del marito perfetti.<br/>"
14102785,103993438,2016-09-25,22925149,Emily,Wonderful stay at Evangelia and Kris' beautiful home! Could not have asked for nicer hosts or a more beautiful view.
14102785,105276512,2016-10-01,73567819,Rui,"We spend a nice vacation at the Evangelia's home. Evangelia and Christo are very nice people, we have a worme welcoming at their home. The stiudio are well located, we have everything just nearby. We really loved our days in Athenes."
14102785,109051008,2016-10-19,12306936,Liz,"We had a lovely welcome from Evangelia and Christos. It was lovely to sit and chat with the locals for a few moments when we arrived and it helped us relax and get into the vacation mood. The apartment was as pictured - a lovely, clean, modern top floor studio with an outdoor patio. It was like having an outdoor living room in the lovely Greek weather.  The apartment is in the center of the city, walking distance to everything including nice restaurants and coffee shops. 
<br/>Evangelia and Christos were excellent hosts, very welcoming and accommodated our baby with a suitable bed. We highly recommend this apartment."
14102785,111074972,2016-10-30,34537738,Monica Bøe,"The location of the loft is extremly central and interesting. Just beneath the Acropolis and in walking distance to most other places including metro, tram, shopping etc. Evangelia was a very welcoming and helpful host, and since she lives in the same building she was always available if we needed anything. We will probably stay there again!"
14102785,113895851,2016-11-14,19143778,Maria,"Evagelia's place was really nice. The location is excellent and the actual flat very cozy. The patio is fantastic to sit and enjoy lazy afternoons in the sun under the Acropolis. <br/>Evangelia was very easy to communicate with, at hand for suggestions and ideas of what to do, very helpful and some minor issues we had were resolved immediately. The place is very clean and ideal for a couple. <br/>The only thing to be aware of is the size of the bathroom. It is TINY and I mean tiny. The ceiling height as well as the actual shower space hardly fit a normal sized person, let alone someone who is taller than 1,75m. "
14102785,115016568,2016-11-21,35887370,Marie,"We had a lovely stay in Evangelia's apartment. It's perfectly located near the metro station, Acropolis and the rest of the city. The apartment itself has the most beautiful view and had everything we needed. Evangelia is the perfect host and we can only give our very best recommendations. Will definately stay there again if we get the chance :)"
14102785,121430246,2016-12-17,19803137,Daniele,"We loved our stay at Evangelia's. She and her husband were incredibly friendly and shared some Greek dessert with us at the end of a long day. Wonderful people.<br/><br/>The loft is a small room, but comfortable and the view from the terrace can't be beat. The shower is indeed super tiny but it wasn't a problem for us. Location was fantastic, right under the acropolis with many restaurants nearby.<br/><br/>We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
14102785,122253035,2016-12-22,19803137,Daniele,"This was our second stay at Evangelia's home, and we love this cozy, private nook on the 3rd floor, with a view of the Acropolis. <br/><br/>On this visit, we also experienced a rare treat.  While Evangelia and her husband were redoing their basement, archaelogists requested to explore the ground underneath. They found stones dating back to 500 BC that formed the base of a monument that was a tower constructed for the winner of an ancient literary competition. Evangelia and her husband have now renovated the basement floor with glass inserts, so that you can peer down and see the ruins. This was a really special delight and reminded us that Athens is a city on top of cities. If you stay here, ask if they will show you. <br/><br/>Aside from that, we plan to stay here on every future visit to Athens — they are the most lovely people. "
14102785,126237037,2017-01-10,5906725,Andreas,"Evangelia was an incredibly kind and sweet host and her place is simply lovely. Such a beautiful and cozy studio, hidden away on the top floor in Plaka directly below the Akropolis with an incredible view towards it. "
14102785,130053872,2017-02-04,21244397,Emily,"An absolutely beautiful home! We know Athens very well and wanted to come just for the weekend. It was the perfect getaway. The location is amazing, the terrace having beautiful views of the Acropolis. We had planned a dinner out but in the end loved the balcony so much we stayed and had dinner there. Evangelina and her husband where wonderful hosts, and their home is beautiful. I would definitely recommend this property. If you see it's available grab it while you can!!! "
14102785,131038816,2017-02-10,69595890,Véronique And Christophe,Nice appartment. Good place to visit the acropolis. Evangelia is doing her best to be helpful (just maybe she need to improve a little bit her English... it would be useful...)
14102785,132992091,2017-02-20,22170709,Peter,"I booked Evangelia's place for a couple of days to explore Athens prior to a business trip. Evangelina was very easy to communicate with and was waiting for me when I arrived with a lovely coffee. The apartment is in a brilliant location right in the heart of the old town. Very easy walk to all the sites. Quiet neighbourhood even though centrally located. The apartment is in the roof space. Small but well equipped and with a lovely terrace overlooking the Acropolis. I did have issue with the wifi- it didn't work in the apartment. The other draw back is the bathroom ceiling is very low- I couldn't stand up straight and I am only 5'6. Again, I didn't mind for a couple of days because the host and location more than made up for this. Great for a solo female traveller. Loved this stay and would recommend if you are visiting Athens."

Evangelia y su marido se ocuparon de hacernos sentir como en casa, cuidando todos los detalles! Sin duda recomendable y volveremos si alguna vez estamos nuevamente en Atenas! Gracias por ser tan amables!! Y por todas las atenciónes!!"

14102785,138723853,2017-03-21,16099577,Pierre,"De loin, le meilleur accueil que nous ayons jamais rencontré. Evangelia et Christos ont été d'une très grande gentillesse et disponibles durant notre séjour à Athènes. Le loft est très agréable, idéalement situé, avec une terrasse et une splendide vue sur l'Acropole. Le logement est calme, mais situé dans un quartier très vivant. Proche des transports (ligne de métro vers l'aéroport), des commerces, des principaux sites à visiter.<br/>Allez-y les yeux fermés!<br/><br/>By far, the best welcome we have ever had. Evangelia and Christos were very kind and helpful during our stay in Athens. The loft is very nice, ideally located, with a terrace and a splendid view of the Acropolis. The accommodation is quiet but located in a very lively area. Close to transport (metro line to the airport), shops, main sites to visit.<br/>If we come back, we will definitely stay there again."
14102785,139946930,2017-03-27,114151332,Grigorios,"Excelente sitio, con una ubicación privilegiada. Cerca del metro, cafeterías, bares, y tiendas de conveniencia... Y especialmente en el corazón de Acrópolis/Plaka. Excepcional atención y bienvenida. Lugar muy limpio y acogedor... Volvería siempre..."
14102785,141056359,2017-04-02,12893879,Barbara,Very beautiful and central place to stay in Athens. Evangelia and Christo offered coffee and special greek cherries. We had an interresting conversation and felt very welcome.<br/>Highly recommend!<br/><br/>
14102785,141656635,2017-04-04,114151332,Grigorios,"Además de que el sitio cumple con todas las características ofrecidas en el anuncio, la descripción se queda corta con la calidad de los anfitriones, que no solo nos hicieron sentir como en casa, sino que nos hicieron sentir como parte de su familia. No dudaríamos en recomendarlos como la primera opción de alojamiento al venir a Atenas... Es nuestra tercera visita y cada vez es mejor...<br/><br/>"
14102785,142190682,2017-04-07,22222633,Sara,"Evangelia's place is breathtaking! Such spectacular views of the acropolis. The surrounding area of Plaka is a great location for dinner, and nightlife. A stone throw away from Brettos bar, Lulu's Bakery and the famous acropolis, it is a excellent price. Evangelia is kind, helpful and very accommodating! If I ever visit Athens again I'll book her loft every time! Thank you Evangelia!"
14102785,143306113,2017-04-11,39147737,Marco,"Very cosy and charming house in the middle of Plaka. It's a good place to explore Athens and not far away from the most sightseeing spots. Evangelia and her husband Christos were very charming, nice and obliging. Evangelia can't speak English so well but it wasn't a big problem to communicate anyhow. I can recommend her place if you like to explore Athens for some days by feet. "
14102785,144201703,2017-04-15,88811351,Carol,"Loved everything about this property, the owners went out of their way to make us feel welcome, the property exceeded the description.  We arrived after dark, and were absolutely thrilled with the view of the acropolis from the terrace.  Loved that we could hear the sounds of people eating out in the restaurants just around the corner.  It was so convenient for historic sites, dining, and wandering around plaka.  Would not hesitate to recommend the property.  The only downside might be if you were not able to walk up too many stairs.  I wish we could have stayed a full week.  <br/>What wonderful hosts.  "
14102785,145388231,2017-04-18,44357867,Steven,"Evangelia and her husband were so welcoming. Their loft was absolutely breathtaking with a perfect view of the acropolis from our loft patio. You can't ask for anything better as far as location. It's right in the heart of Plaka and all the shops and restaurants. The loft was super clean and cozy. <br/>If I had to make a couple minor flaws, it would be that the bathroom is super small. So small that I practically have to bend over when taking a shower and I'm only 5'6"". Also, the wifi was essential for us and it was incredibly slow and glitchy and didn't work 50% of the time during our 3 day stay. The wifi only worked when you were in the outside patio but never in the room. <br/>With that said, Evangelia and her husband were so accommodating as if they were your parents. So willing to take of you and your needs. Almost like family. Our flight was at 6am and they even woke up at 3am to get us a taxi to the airport. It was definitely worth it and I would definitely recommend their loft. "
14102785,146546657,2017-04-23,16634269,Johannes,"The studio is small but clean and nice. And with nice weather the roof terrace is the best living place you could wish for, with views on the Acropolis and the Lysicrates monument, only 30 m along the road. <br/><br/>Evangelia and her husband were very helpful and made sure we had everything we wished for during our stay. Many thanks!"
14102785,147299623,2017-04-26,4016910,Béatrice,"Evangelia's flat was lovely, very cosy and convenient (apart from the bathroom but we were warned). The terrace is amazing and we enjoyed it a lot. The view is beautiful and you really feel apart from the crowd. The location is very central, the street is a bit too touristy and commercial but at least we were close to everything. Slight downsides : the window blinds do not really seem to work (a bit annoying for light sleepers), and the Wi-Fi is not so good. But the very warm welcome we received, and the view, completely made up for that ! "
14102785,148131633,2017-04-30,68152814,Lisa,"Evangelia and Christos are such wonderful hosts and the terrace apartment is the perfect spot for a couple to spend their time in Athens.  The location couldn't be any better - it's just steps from the Acropolis and museum and in the heart the Plaka area.  The bathroom is a challenge,  but manageable as long as you aren't too tall. If we are lucky enough to return to Athens, we will definitely stay here again!"
14102785,148638692,2017-05-01,64867313,Aleksandr,"Nice flat, convinient location, very friendly host"
14102785,149049691,2017-05-02,29784821,Philippe,"Great place to stay, very well located, clean and the host is very accommodating. Just a few minor things : wifi coverage does not include the room but just the terrasse, the bed is not a king size, the room looks smaller than in the pics, taking a shower is a challenge, and the host does not speak English.<br/>When we stayed, the blind store was broken so we had daylight in the room early in the morning, but that should be fixed quickly.<br/>All together absolutely worth a stay!"
14102785,149468408,2017-05-04,11575626,Jake,"Great hosts! We got there and they served us coffee and cookies, traditional Greek! <br/><br/>The only negative thing was that the bathroom was very very small. "
14102785,149792673,2017-05-06,60705169,Francoise,"Le studio est particulièrement bien situé dans le quartier de Plaka permettant des visites à pieds tout autours.  Le métro est à 5 min et l'accès est très facile de/vers l'aéroport, port, ... Le logement est dans un quartier très agréable, vivant mais le fait d'être au 2e étage le rend calme et la terrasse est très agréable. L'accueil et la disponibilité d'Evangelia en font une hôtesse parfaite .  Le studio est très bien équipé mais conviendra difficilement à des personnes très grandes (il est sous les combles). Un logement parfait pour visiter Athènes donc."
14102785,150919110,2017-05-10,18181866,Camma,"Vi havde et perfekt ophold i Evangelias lejlighed. Beliggenheden for foden af Akropolis, i midten af bydelen Plaka er helt optimal, tæt på det hele inklusive metrostation. Tagterrassen er virkelig dejlig og super rar både om dagen og om aftenen. Evangelia og hendes mand var meget hjælpsomme og var så søde at have skaffet en ekstra seng til vores baby."
14102785,151332972,2017-05-12,51741997,Hayley,This is the most unique place we have ever stayed!  We were on our honeymoon in Athens--it's perfect!  The private balcony has an incredible view of the Acropolis and it is so CLOSE to everything! Do be warned the low shower ceiling can be difficult for those 5ft7 and above--but it is well worth it.<br/>Evangelia even showed us the ruins that were discovered under her house--truly an awesome experience.
14102785,151685685,2017-05-14,120804809,Veronica,The apartment is very well located. Very close to the Acropolis and the museum. The attic is a little small but cozy and the terrace with the view of the Acropolis makes it way better. The property seems to be recently renovated. The host received us with coffee and sweets and were very helpful and friendly. Only downside was that the air conditioner is more of a fan than cooling unit and it was hot outside. 
14102785,152749407,2017-05-18,34430922,Josh,"Pros: amazing terrace and view of Acropolis - much better than anticipated and pictured. Very nice and accommodating hosts. Other house guests were also very nice. <br/><br/>Cons: didn't realize the open setting of the apartment (other guests on other floors - fine, just didn't realize that). Bathroom was really small - again, fine, but the shower was tough given the size. AC didn't really work and it was hot and the WiFi signal was weak. Full disclosure, I was there infrequently enough I didn't raise the issues with Evangelina. Just noting my experience.<br/><br/>Overall I liked my stay there and it was nice to work at night on the terrace in the shadow of the Acropolis. Also great conversation with other guests. "
14102785,154396182,2017-05-24,23821036,Matthew,"Charming apartment in a perfect location ... and for English travellers you follow in the footsteps of the Great Lord Byron, philhellene, who lived almost opposite in 1810 (now demolished), who played a part in the liberation of Greece from the Turks. Lovely cosy apartment, with private terrace and a great view. A perfect  address for museums, monuments, and the numerous bars and restaurants Plaka has to offer. Hosts are charming too, wonderful Greek hospitality!"
14102785,154576799,2017-05-25,4345374,Stacie,Great location in one of the best neighborhoods in Athens! Evangelina is very sweet and gave us a very warm welcome. The rooftop deck was our favorite part - you can see the acropolis from there! Highly recommended! 
14102785,155871497,2017-05-29,43182439,Matana,"This is such a charming and cozy space, perfect for a solo traveler or a couple. The loft does have a sloping ceiling, this is only an issue in the bathroom, we are both 5'6""ish and struggled a bit with the shower, so if you are much taller this might not be the place for you. Overall we had a great stay, can't get over how central this apartment is, we were able to get in from the rain in just a few minutes. Check-in was a breeze even though we arrived late, around midnight, the hosts were gracious and ready to welcome us and get us settled. "
14102785,156800555,2017-06-01,57090555,Timothy,"Phenomenal location, very clean and a wonderful host!<br/><br/>We really loved our stay!"
14102785,156971177,2017-06-02,118767497,Laurel,"Evangelia was a fantastic host and welcomed us with fresh squeezed orange juice. She was easy to get ahold of, and while she is still learning English, she was great at responding to messages and using a translating app to communicate in person. The apartment is in a great location in the Plaka near the Acropolis metro station. Other reviewers are correct that the bathroom ceiling is really low. My mother is 5' 2"" and even she had to squat to use the mirror or shower. All in all a really clean place and great host! With the bathroom situation, I'd stay again for one night, but more than that I'm not so sure. We had a great stay though, so thank you Evangelia!"
14102785,157895377,2017-06-05,24901433,Kayla,"Loved the place. Perfectly in the center of Plaka with easy access to restaurants, shopping and an amazing view of the Acropolis! Evangelia was very accessible and we very much loved our stay."
14102785,159146009,2017-06-10,27358096,Delphine,"Ce logement est tout petit  mais cosy, et sa belle terrasse est parfaite : vue directe sur le monument de Lysicrate à 30m, et le mur Est de l'acropole au dessus des toits. Il faut noter que c'est un quartier très vivant, mais le soir, passé 23h30, tout est calme. On est tout près de tout ce qu'il faut faire à Plaka et du Musée de l'Acropole. Quel plaisir de prendre son petit déjeuner sur cette terrasse!<br/>On est très bien reçu. Le monsieur était charmant, il avait mis des fruits dans le frigo et m'a apporté du lait. Le studio est très bien équipé : nespresso, etc. <br/>La seule réserve est la salle d'eau : je mesure 1,60m et j'avais la tête collée au plafond dans la douche, qui est très serrée et avec un rideau peu pratique. Globalement, on est trop serré dans cette salle d'eau. Il faudrait aussi rénover (repeindre) le sol, qui a quelques taches peu avenantes.<br/>J'ai pu laisser mon sac le jour de mon départ, et en bas, une sorte de patio très agréable m'est resté accessible. C'était très bien.<br/>"
14102785,159493091,2017-06-11,58211287,Magui,Eva was so kind and helpful!  The  apartment is beatiful and has a  great location!
14102785,159954873,2017-06-12,31792363,Danny,Evangelia's apartment was in the perfect location. Everything was a short walk away. A nice deck area to hang out with a nice view of the city. Be aware that the bathroom is very small. 
14102785,160205091,2017-06-13,3035718,Devitt,"Nice view from the roof, thanks for carry our lugguage to the top, Near the Train station and the museum, shopping street just nearby, many restaurants around, love here! <br/><br/>Only hard to bath as a tall guy."
14102785,160854611,2017-06-16,1617341,T & D,"Perfect place for a couple in the heart of Athens! Fantastic location, super clean, and with a balcony with view of Acropolis. Evangelia was also very sweet and welcoming. "
14102785,161141660,2017-06-17,51454051,Sam,"This place is in an absolutely ideal location, really nice little area with restaurants and shopping very close. Walking distance to the main sights which is also handy. This accomodation is close to public transport. The room itself is quite small, and whilst the bed is comfortable and the kitchen is a good size, the bathroom is absolutely tiny and it's not possible to stand up straight in the shower. Also the apartment is up 2 flights of narrow stairs that can be a bit hard with luggage. Otherwise Eva is lovely and attentive to any need. Also has great information on what to do locally "
14102785,161546672,2017-06-18,20868964,Deena,"Amazing rooftop studio of a townhouse-- view of the acropolis was fantastic! Great neighborhood with tons within walking distance. Very clean and comfortable room, though a small shower, especially for my tall husband. Great communication. They were so nice to greet us late (due to a delayed flight) and provide umbrellas. Again, the location is very cool, and beautiful spot!"
14102785,161940394,2017-06-19,6998110,Leire,Apartamento muy acogedor y practico con una terraza preciosa  y con mucho encanto.El marido de Evangelia nos recibió muy amablemente y nos dejó fruta y agua en la nevera.
14102785,162711169,2017-06-22,54118418,Sam,This place is great! It is so close to everything and offers great views and value for the Plaka area. I would definitely stay here again. Evangelia was great to deal with and always very responsive.
14102785,162972775,2017-06-23,9124531,Léa,Evangelia est très gentille et accueillante.<br/>La maison est superbe et le petit studio avec la terrasse vue sur l'Acropole le soir est magique !<br/>Emplacement idéal !<br/>Nous reviendrons 
14102785,164026117,2017-06-26,2037718,Bijal,"Evangelina's apartment is delightful. It is on the small side but has everything that you need. The terrace with a view of the Acropolis is lovely and we spent quite a lot of time out there. It's in the heart of Plaka with shops, restaurants and the Acropolis on your doorstep. <br/><br/>We didn't get to meet Evangelina but our check in was great even though we arrived at around midnight. <br/><br/>Thanks again for a wonderful stay!"
14102785,164481071,2017-06-27,2782166,Jia,"evangelia and her husband are such gracious and thoughtful hosts. this is the first i'm traveling with my 15 months old baby to a place i do not know. i tried to prepare as much as possible, but obviously couldn't think of everything. evangelia and her husband were very helpful to make sure we have everything we needed and that we were comfortable. <br/><br/>thank you very much for this short but wonderful stay in athens. we will surly come back again and i highly recommend this beautiful family home to anyone interested. <br/><br/>"
14102785,166621742,2017-07-04,29453412,Sina,"Evangelia's Unterkunft war super zentral, sauber und sie sowie ihr Mann waren sehr freundlich. Durch eine Flugverspätung sind wir mitten in der Nacht angekommen und wir wurden trotz allem sehr freundlich begrüßt. Leider haben wir Evangelia nie zu Gesicht bekommen. Man sollte jedoch beachte, dass man um in die Unterkunft zu kommen durch die zweite Unterkunft, welche auch von ihr angeboten wird, durchlaufen muss. Somit kann man nicht direkt sagen, dass es eine eigene Unterkunft ist. Die Dachterrasse ist ein Traum :), aber auch hier muss man darauf achten, dass diese nur zu dieser Unterkunft gehört, wir hatten nämlich plötzlich die ""Mieter"" der zweiten Unterkunft auf unserer Terrasse und da diese Unterkunft hier eine Glasfront hat, ist dies nicht allzu praktisch. Ich würde niemand diese Unterkunft empfehlen, der größer als 1,75m ist, die Dusche ist sehr niedrig, da die Dachschräge hier sehr tief ist. Ich mit meinen 1,68m konnte gerade so stehen, meine Freund mit 1,78m musste sich sehr bücken. Im sitzen duschen funktioniert nämlich auch nicht. Ich würde für 1-3 Nächte wieder hier übernachten, aber nicht unbedingt länger."
14102785,167267444,2017-07-06,4057110,Mark,"Location is great. Place is safe and clean. The bathroom is tiny and you can't stand as you take an awkward shower. That aspect means that longer stays would be tough. The entire building feels like there are multiple rooms being rented out. Maybe a little like an upscale hostel, but much nicer and cleaner. We would definitely stay again."
14102785,167825324,2017-07-08,109098157,Aurélie,"Emplacement simplement génial, au coeur de Plaka et ses sublimes rues, des restaurants juste au pas de la porte (mais aucune nuisance le soir), un appartement avec tout ce qu'il faut, une grande terrasse magique avec vue sur l'acropole, à 5 minutes à pieds des monuments et musées les plus importants, à moins de 10 minutes à pieds du métro (au top quand on arrive de l'aéroport ou du port, pas besoin de prendre de taxi) !! Un accueil d'une extrême gentillesse des propriétaires !! Que demander de plus ?? <br/>Nous avons adoré notre séjour à Athènes grâce à ce superbe appart et ses propriétaires !!"
14102785,168215980,2017-07-09,19559074,Vera Giulia,"Our stay at Evangelina's flat was really nice. We loved the cute ,little, romantic studio with its beautiful terrace. Everything was perfectly clean :) We appreciated the nespresso coffee! The bathroom is really tiny but for a few nights it's alright. We had to clim some stairs to get to our studio but that way really had our privacy and the location for exploring athens couldn't be better! <br/>We warmly recommend this accomodation!<br/>  "
14102785,169330275,2017-07-12,10687689,Dan,"Myself and my wife needed a place to stay while we were transiting from Italy to Santorini and this place made for a great choice; it is very clean and the balcony offers great opportunity to relax in peace and get some of that nice Athens sun while observing the Acropolis in the distance. Yes, as others have stated the bathroom can be a bit tight, but life is about experiences. This is also a great location for those who wish to be near the street markets and a nice scenic walk to the Parthenon."
14102785,169850655,2017-07-14,3933615,Danielle,"Evangelina was a fantastic host communicative the entire time. Her apartment is perfectly located with views of the acropolis, market, restaurants, and walking distance to all major sites. I would definitely stay here again and recommend the apartment for other travelers. "
14102785,170310311,2017-07-15,34833524,Leah,"Evangelia was fantastic! She checked in with us a few times to make sure everything was fine or if we needed anything. The place was very clean and cute. There was even a washing mashing to do laundry which was great. The bathroom is very small though, such we had read in other reviews so we were prepared for that (You probably won't be able to stand up in the shower). We were only there for one night so it was perfect for that, great location, with a view of the Acropolis!"
14102785,170625242,2017-07-16,54297172,Madeline,Best location in Athens! Hosts were super helpful and accomodating

14102785,173376786,2017-07-23,107589764,Kieren,"Fantastic location, great balcony, clean and an easy check-in. The hosts were nice and helpful. The bathroom ceiling is very low (I literally had to squat to shower) but you should already know this if you've read the description. Not really a problem if you're staying for a night or two, but any longer and it would have been annoying. Other than that no complaints."
14102785,175504252,2017-07-29,38944241,Lea,"Das Appartement ist in einem schmalen Haus mitten in der Altstadt.  Für Sightseeing bestens geeignet. Von der hübschen privaten Dachterrasse sieht man auf die Akropolis und das Akropolismuseum. Alle wichtigen Sehenswürdigkeiten sind fußläufig zu erreichen, ebenso zahlreiche Cafés, Restaurants und Shops. Trotz der zentralen Lage ist es aber ruhig und gemütlich. <br/>Die Wohnung selbst liegt im obersten Stockwerk und ist über ein schmales Treppenhaus zu erreichen.  Für viel Gepäck oder Menschen die nicht gut zi Fuß sind könnte das nicht optimal sein. Über die private Dachterrasse kommt man in die Wohnung. Diese ist klein, aber für zwei Personen gut ausreichend, sauber und modern und freundlich einrichtet. Durch die Dachschrägen ist es sehr gemütlich. Die Ausstattung ist wie beschrieben.  Tee, Kaffee und gekühltes Wasser standen schon zur Verfügung.  Das Bad ist tatsächlich sehr klein und vor allem niedrig, aber modern und sauber.<br/>Jeder Kontakt mit Evangelia war sehr freundlich und sie hat alle Anfragen sehr schnell beantwortet.  Bei der Ankunft hat sie uns schon auf der Straße erwartet und freundlich begrüßt. Auch während unseres Aufenthaltes hat sie sich mehrmals erkundigt ob es uns gut geht oder wir noch etwas brauchen.<br/>Alles in allem waren wir äußerst zufrieden und können das Appartement uneingeschränkt weiter empfehlen."

14102785,179713531,2017-08-08,15300608,Marco,"This small apartment under the roof is perfectly located in the heart of plaka discrict. Few steps from metro akropoli and 5 minutes walking from monastiraki square, its very silent, clean and comfortable. The bathroom is very very small, so if you are tall shoul be not perfectly comfortable. Evangelia takes care a lot about her guest and the communication before, during and after the journey is very good. A very good experience."
14102785,181161835,2017-08-12,183543,Valentine,"Evangelia's place is perfectly located and if it is a small studio, it is very pleasant especially thanks to the beautiful terrasse and view. Perfect for a few days in Athens. And Evangelia and Christos are very welcoming and charming. We will come back!! "

14102785,184127662,2017-08-19,28794212,David,"We stayed for three nights total on Evangelias amazing roof top room in the historical neighbourhood of Plaka, Athens, and want to recommend it to anybody visiting the city. The description and pictures are almost to modest when taking into account that the room and roof top terrace is litteraly located right next to Akropolis with the Dionysos entrance being just a tiny stone throw away. Besides that Evangelia and her husband were great hosts who went out of their way to make our stay as good as possible. "
14102785,185706027,2017-08-22,16130183,Asia,So close to the Parthenon you can see it from the patio!! Small and perfect for a couple or solo traveler. Had a Nespresso machine which I really appreciated! Super cute architecture I would love to stay again!

The flat was very clean and a perfect location for Athens' top tourist sites. Really enjoyed our stay. Perfect for a short stay of two days or so."
14102785,188327750,2017-08-29,63459840,Mat,"Nous avons apprécié notre séjour dans cet appartement et ce quartier. <br/>Le quartier est touristique, très vivant et à proximité des principaux lieux d'intérêts et moyens de transports. <br/>L'appartement est agréable, bien équipé (Nespresso avec capsules ! ) et dispose d'une suberbe terrasse avec vue sur l'Acropole. La salle d'eau n'est cependant pas très commode car le plafond est bas et mansardé, comme il est possible de le voir sur les photos. <br/>Evangelia est vraiment sympathique, attentionnée et arrangeante (pour les bagages au moment de quitter les lieux). La communication avec Evangelia a été facile et agréable. <br/>Nous recommandons. <br/><br/>We appreciate our stay in Evangelia's flat. The appartment is very well situated, comfortable.<br/>Evangialia is a very pleasant host."
14102785,188702747,2017-08-30,4119907,Marine,We had a great time. The appartment is ideally located and clean. Amazing view on the Acropolis !
14102785,189637263,2017-09-02,8059645,Amy,"Evangelia's loft apartment is the perfect place to stay if you're exploring Athens for a short trip. We had two nights in the city and I'm sure there isn't a more central, convenient and lovely apartment. The balcony view of the Acropolis is wonderful and you are right by the museum, as well as countless bars and restaurants in Plaka. The apartment is small (the bathroom / shower very small!) but it is comfortable, clean and has absolutely everything you need. Evangelia was very kind at check in and before we arrived. Very much recommended."
14102785,190828508,2017-09-05,15063641,Spyridon,Amazing views and location. Athens at its best. Evangelia and her husband were both great.
14102785,191282463,2017-09-07,70704052,Joan,Great location. Good value. Only downside is shower is tiny. Be prepared to bend or kneel down !
14102785,191915823,2017-09-09,20278189,Chantal,The perfect cd real Athens locations.. near many restaurants and shops- yet quite and private inside. A great view of the acropolis and the temple of Zeus.. etc etc. great spot and yes the bathroom is small but it is cozy and secluded feeling- wonderful!
14102785,193127742,2017-09-12,2929719,Marianne,This was THE perfect place to be for one night in Athens.<br/>Evangelia's and her husband are so lovely!<br/>The place has such a smart use of space. Loved the climbing glass steps and our own little roof garden. Just Wonderful.<br/>Well done and would stay here again!
14102785,193337506,2017-09-13,20255779,Hélène,Son emplacement idéal et le charme fou de ce studio avec terrasse fantastique donnant sur le musée de l'Acropole (on aperçoit de nuit les frises du Parthenon exposées au dernier étage du musée) et la forteresse de l'Acropole à 2 pas séduiront les amoureux d'Athènes.<br/>Accueil chaleureux et grande facilité d'échange avec Evangelia
14102785,193615944,2017-09-14,41399258,Louise,"Evangelia's apartment was in a fabulous location, right in the centre of the picturesque Plaka area of Athens, and very near the Acropolis. The apartment is  small, and the shower ceiling very low, but it is clean and the bed very comfortable. Thank you Evangelia for being a great host."
14102785,195044180,2017-09-18,48019686,Avishek,Very responsive and excellent location!

La salle de bains est un petit peu basse de plafond mais le logement est globalement tellement bien situé, bien équipé et l'accueil tellement chaleureux que ce n'est pas fondamental.<br/>Grande facilité de communication. Équipements et petites attentions très appréciables!"

14102785,198055570,2017-09-28,23431361,Tiffany,Evangelia terrace is AMAZING! When you first walk in you're greeted with one of the friendliest hosts. The house constantly smelled of fresh laundry. Impeccable care and cleanliness goes into this home and it definitely shows. Awesome view of the Acropolis for breakfasts on the balcony. And the laundry machine is a bonus. Couldn't figure out if there was a drying function but it was fine since we air dried our clothes on the terrace anyway. Highly Recommend!
14102785,199827076,2017-10-03,81372545,Alexander,"Die Lage ist perfekt. Direkt in der Altstadt mit 5 Gehminuten zur Akropolis und zu allen möglichen Cafés und Restaurants. Die Dachterrasse ist bei schönem Wetter mit Blick auf die Akropolis traumhaft. Die Wohnung ist ebenfalls top. Sauber, hell und ausreichend ausgestattet. Waschmaschine, Herd, Nespressomaschine etc. alles was das Herz begehrt.<br/><br/>Der einzige Minuspunkt ist die Dusche. Diese ist direkt in der Dachschräge situiert, welches ein aufrechtes Duschen bei einer Körpergröße von über 1,60m nicht möglich macht.<br/><br/>Wer schlecht zu Fuß ist, wird bei der An- und Abreise Probleme mit den Koffern und der engen Wendeltreppe haben.<br/><br/>Ungeachtet dessen haben wir unseren Aufenthalt bei Evangelia sehr genossen und kommen gerne wieder hier her."
14102785,200385538,2017-10-05,152607275,Pál,"Evangelia's apartment is fantastic. It is small, but it was perfectly suited to us. The terrace is very cozy and beautiful in the view. We felt very well at the base of the Acropolis!"
14102785,201006505,2017-10-07,16215379,Darren,"Evangelia's place is a little gem amongst the hustle and bustle of Athens. As others have noted, the shower is rather cramped, but the location, cleanliness and private veranda easily make this a fab base from which to explore the city."
14102785,202621197,2017-10-12,65800981,Natalie,Evangelia’s place was in an incredible locations with a great view. Just what we needed for our last night in Athens. The loft was clean and our host was incredibly responsive!
14102785,203417502,2017-10-15,29233833,Shane,"Perfectly central, great style, attention to detail, a very clean and comfortable place to stay. <br/>The view from the veranda area of the Acroplolis is great and so close. We were able to see it easily from the Acropolis. The Acropolis, museums, shops and good tavernas are on the door step. It really is in the heart of Plaka. <br/>Equipped with the insight of the reviews I was prepared for the bathroom with the low ceiling. At an average height it was challenging the have a shower! So not for Giants. However even with this for a night it was perfect and I will stay here again definitely. <br/>Evangelia and her husband Christos are lovely and very welcoming, which indeed added extra warmth to an already perfect visit. Enjoy!"
14102785,204219991,2017-10-17,95618437,Brittany,"Great location! Right in the middle of all the historical locations. Center of the town easy walk to tons of food places. Only downside was the bathroom, it is very small inside and hard to shower in. Otherwise wonderful for what we needed."
14102785,205152276,2017-10-21,4621766,Rebecca,Amazing location! <br/>Evangelie is lovely and super easy to communicate with. <br/>The apartment is small with the shower taking some getting used to but the balcony more than makes up for it. We spent our last night in Athens on the balcony with some local wine chatting the night away as we stared at the beautiful acropolis. I would definitely recommend.
14102785,209020943,2017-11-04,3154450,Anna,Very good Place like a little caban near the acropole
14102785,210570022,2017-11-10,139725671,Dimitris,Εξαιρετικό σπίτι!Ο χώρος φιλοξενίας είναι μικρός και η τουαλέτα για νάνους!
14102785,211774895,2017-11-14,144398828,Philipp,Very central and also quiet accommodation in the old town of Athens. <br/>Very friendly hosts.
14102785,213805574,2017-11-23,86397288,Silver,"The home is adorable and the location is perfect. We walked to the Acropolis, the temple of Zeus, shops, Cafe’s, Greece’s oldiest distillery is two steps away. You won’t need to drive anywhere and you can’t beat the veiws from the top of the apartment. The bathroom is the only thing that wasn’t jaw dropping. We hit our heads a few times, you have to duck while showering and while using the restroom. I would definitely come back to Evangelia’s!"
14102785,229369044,2018-01-23,28551461,Johannes,The host canceled this reservation 207 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14102785,519174346,2019-08-28,3231187,Thalia,"This home is located in Plaka, which is the perfect location to immerse yourself in Ancient Greece. It was literally a 5 minute walk to the Acropolis, museums, Monastiraki Flea Market, local fruit markets, and many great restaurants. Transportation from the airport to her place was easy. You have three options: Metro, a local taxi, or Uber (which is no longer available in Athens but the app is connected to the local taxi service). We used Uber because the app already had our information loaded from USA and could better communicate our desire destination. <br/>Evangelia’s place is magical! The aesthetics are just beautiful and exactly how the photos look here in the post. The loft overlooks the surrounding neighborhood and the Main Street and local monument. Because this is a loft be aware that there are some stairs to climb. It could be tiring and difficult for someone with walking problems. The shower is very small and built constrained by the rooftop, so be aware that you will need to crouch a bit to take a shower.  That being said, water was perfect and hot, and the bathroom was clean (shampoo, soap, detergent for the washer, dish soap, first aid kit, were all available) <br/>Water from the tap in Athens is fine to drink, so we refill our bottles often. AC was great and bed super comfortable. Towels were provided. WiFi router was located right next to the bed. Evangelia is the cutest host and she will reply to all your questions promptly. One last thing we loved about this place, was the electrical orange juicer she left for us in the kitchen and the bowl of oranges she also provided. It was so amazing to have fresh squeezed juice in the morning. We can’t thank her enough for everything she did for us. Highly recommending this place and host to anyone."

14102785,536123674,2019-09-26,3141496,Laura & Vincent,"We could not have asked for a better location. The roof terrace was great and super spacious, and while the apartment itself is small, it is very well set up. We felt like there was plenty of space for us 2 people. As others mentioned the shower ceiling height is short, but at 5' 6"", I did not find it that challenging. We weren't sure what to expect based on other reviews on privacy, but this was indeed very private. Evangelia was also great at communicating and checking in with us to see that we had everything that we needed. Overall, a great stay in Athens!"

I felt like I was living in the attic hideaway of some wealthy old relative. Especially high marks for the terrace, which is well-appointed and private.

She greeted me upon my arrival, gave recommendations around the city, helped me set up transportation to the airport and was always in communication. The accommodation itself is breathtaking and honestly, so special. You can take a private shower on the deck overlooking the sunset and always have the acropolis in view from the deck. I could walk to all the sights and was literally in the center of everything. I give this place my highest recommendation!"

The patio had great views and the overall vibe of the loft is very charming. <br/>Be aware of the low ceiling in the bathroom (bumped my head at least once), but if you know that going into it you’ll be fine. There is an outdoor shower across the patio (private) that does not have the same height restriction."

14117432,116385988,2016-11-30,100203574,P.J.,Spacious and comfortable apartment in a surprising area with many small cafés and restaurants. 10-minute walk from the metro that you within 5 minutes brings to the city Centre. The Owner is friendly and helpful. Welcomes you with a bottleneck of wine and extra water. Fine. 
14117432,124185383,2017-01-01,56335600,Holly,"Great location on a small street amongst local residences, cafes and restaurants.  Short walk to the Parthenon and shopping area (catering to tourists).   I enjoyed breakfast and coffee on the deck with amazing views.  The flat is clean and comfortable, Panos was so friendly and responded quickly to a 'beeping' fire sensor that needed a new battery.  Access to wifi and cable TV was great."

14117432,141429196,2017-04-03,25706970,Katherine,"This was a great apartment. Panos was incredibly nice and extremely accommodating--one of the best AirBnB hosts I have ever had. He had bottles of water, fruit and wine waiting for us at the apartment, gave us maps of the city and checked in throughout the weekend. The neighborhood is a bit dodgy but the view of the Acropolis is fantastic and it is close to a couple metro stations as well as the center of the city. Thank you for everything, Panos!"
14117432,143482422,2017-04-12,12956713,Sascha,"Perfect host, great place, great spot!"

14117432,149194401,2017-05-03,6515157,Wael,"L'appartement est génial, très agréable et très bien équipé. Et la terrasse en est l'atout majeur. Grande, très peu de vis à vis et la vue sur l'acropole est un enchantement. <br/>Le quartier est super animé avec plein de cafés, bars et restos, à l'écart de la cohorte de touristes insupportable du centre ville. Et en plus il est authentique puisque vous y trouverez quasiment que des locaux. En plus de ça il est propre et sécur si vous avez des enfants. Petite mention spéciale au Big Kahuna juste en face de l'appartement qui sert des burgers de folies dans un cadre idyllique.<br/>Alors effectivement on entend les gens festoyer, mais rien de bien dérangeant. Et personnellement je préfère entendre des gens s'amuser plutôt que le traffic. <br/>Bref cette location est un sans faute ! Merci Panayotis !"
14117432,151102691,2017-05-11,30470402,Cathy,Very clean & comfortable.  Panos was more than gracious & a wonderful host.

We were a group of three 30's years old and we had great fun around as there are plenty of cafés, alternative bars and restaurant. The location is perfect to visit the city and we definitely recommend Panos' place. The flat has everything you need. Enjoy !!"
14117432,154166212,2017-05-23,5711977,Heath,"Our stay in Panos' flat in central Athens could not have been better.  First, the view of the Acropolis is amazing -- having dinner on the patio is something we will always remember.  The flat is in a perfect location for seeing the sights, and close to a range of fun and interesting restaurants.  Panos was a wonderful host, making special accommodation to meet us for a late check-in and making sure we had everything we needed.  We would gladly stay there again."

There is everything you need : air conditionning in the bedrooms, a washing machine, and a comfortable little bathroom.<br/>The neighborhood is calm and also full of nice bars to go to. It is close to a supermarket and the pleasant Monastiraki streets.<br/>I fully recommend you this apartment if you want to spend a great time in Athens."

The apartment is not located in one of these luxury and typical tourist areas, but in a very hip part of town where the streets are full of character and life, especially in the evening. There are loads of bars and cafes which are incredible beautiful because of their induviduality and details and there was also a really nice street market (on a tuesday morning). We walked to the  akropolis and it took us about 25 minutes. The Host Panos was also amazing. He waited for us and gave us tipps and explained everything we wanted to know. We had absolutely nothing  to complain about and will definetely come back"

14117432,233580485,2018-02-10,8060013,Oliver,Panos is really lovely man. And the whole place is extraordinary clean. And also huge. The terrace (with at least 330° view) is fantastic. If there's anything to complain - maybe a little bit to many plastic flowers in the apartment (but they were also cleaned and dust-free). Great place!

I think  that we dont  need more, I recomand this flat for everybody also old people because the flat is in chill place in the center of Athenes but also for young people because you re just near monasteraki and  Gazi 2 nice places to have a drink"
14117432,245646851,2018-03-23,10938376,Jan,Panos Place is in a very nice area to have a drink or go out for some food. The place is still quite though and the huge balcony just a blast!

14117432,257158457,2018-04-25,176694714,Yvonne,"Fantastiskt läge. Lugnt men gångavstånd till de flesta sevärdheter samt centrum. Många barer o restauranger, grönt och fint. Panos är en otroligt bra värd, vänlig och svarar omedelbart på frågor. Hjälpsam på alla de sätt. Att sitta på balkongen och dricka ett glas vin ( som vi fick av Panos) och ha utsikt över upplysta Akropolis på kvällen är helt underbart. <br/>Kan verkligen rekommendera denna lägenhet. Vi är så nöjda och önskar Panos all lycka."
14117432,263440216,2018-05-12,2310058,Pamela,"The apartment was as described. It was very comfortable and very well equipped. The balcony was great for morning coffee and evening drinks.<br/><br/>Close to the metro line and many restaurants, bars and a grocery store are all within a two block radius.<br/><br/>Panos is definitely a super host. We recommend staying in Panos' apartment."

There were plenty of great dining options just around the corner. The host was great - he met us outside the apartment when our taxi pulled up, gave us a great orientation to the neighborhood, and even left us some fruit, water bottles, and wine."
14117432,272227309,2018-06-03,5708239,Christine,"Panos's apartment was great. The view was incredible, and the location was perfect.

14117432,319314173,2018-09-06,180371,Alexandre,"Panos is a great host and made sure that I was feeling very comfortable during my stay. He was very patient, as he waited for me quite a long time when I missed the bus from the airport to the centre of Athens. The pictures in the ad give an accurate impression of the flat, the terrace is roomy and definitely a plus compared to other listings. One thing that I was personally disappointed about is the area in which the flat lies. Although it's safe, it's a bit run down. It's about 15 min by foot to Monastiraki metro station. All in all I can recommend it."
14117432,320081705,2018-09-08,70859974,Mary,"This apartment in a hip and great location in Athens was a perfect base for our far to brief 3 days in Athens.   The host is charming and accommodating.  The view from the terrace is extraordinary.  The area has fun coffee spots, brew options and other funky fun options.   The apartment has two bedrooms, both equipped with very efficient air conditioning.    The apartment has everything you could need and more.  It is very central to most of the major attractions and countless shops and restaurants.   Cabs run very lTe in the evening and the bus (to the airport) runs all night.  We had a very early flight and we were able to grab a cab easily at 1:45 am (for 7 euros) to the central square (where the bus begins) and easily made it to the airport (for 6 euro each on the bus).   Great time overall.  Thank you,"
14117432,324889734,2018-09-18,25181582,Sam,Panos’ apartment is great. Good location very nice new of Acropolis and clean with all amenities needed for a comfortable stay.

14117432,332332382,2018-10-05,156464438,Amanda,"This was one of the best AirBNB's that I've stayed at! Clean, cozy, comfortable, lovely! <br/><br/>The apartment is on the 5th floor and can be reached via the elevator, it is a large apartment and has 2 comfortable beds with a couch and some chairs in the living room. <br/><br/>The host met us at the door when we arrived and welcomed us warmly. Linens, towels, and washcloths were clean and laid out for us upon our arrival. He had extra blankets in the drawers. We were also pleasantly surprised with waters in the fridge, bananas, apples, and wine on the table for us, soap, shampoo, and a blow dryer in the bathroom. The balcony was very large and wrapped around the apartment with a gorgeous view of the Parthenon. <br/><br/>The only criticism would be the location - one of our guests was in a wheelchair and reaching the 2 train stops near the apartment was difficult because of the broken sidewalks. We ended up taking taxis to the city which was more expensive, but easier due to the wheelchair. I read that using the tram to get around Athens is the best way, but there was no tram stop near the apartment, just the trains. Also, the area felt very safe, but it was not in the tourist area so there was lots of grafitti on the buildings, stray cats, and broken sidewalks. <br/><br/>We loved our stay and would stay here again!! This was the best host we could've asked for!"
14117432,348531657,2018-11-14,30229869,Pantea,"Nous recommandons vivement cet appartement grand et lumineux avec un super balcon et sublime lumière du matin, très bien placé."

14117432,457970479,2019-05-25,201349291,Thomas,Everything was very clean and the neighbourhood is quite cool. Citycenter is close which makes it possible to walk everywhere. The highlight was sitting on the roof terrasse drinking whine and enjoying the warm evenings.

The kitchen was fully equipped (right from beer mugs to wrapping boxes to take away spoon/fork/knives) <br/>It is a bit far from the city centre in a quite locality. Acropolis and Plaka are both about 30 minutes walk.<br/>Supermarkets and a few cute cafes are right downstairs.<br/>And yes, the view from the balcony is a highlight."

Panos was very friendly and so quick to answer our messages. He waited for us upon arrival at 2am and carried all<br/>Of our suitcases into the apt and saved us a parking spot right under the apt. We loved it. Will definitely be back

Great view of the Parthenon from the balcony, and not too far of a walk to get to that area as well. Host was very friendly and accommodating, would respond quickly and to our every need. Even took us in on a same day booking. Highly recommended!"

14117432,428655058009201196,2021-08-14,259049208,Jenn,"Panos was a wonderful host — our flight got in very late at night and he still waited up for us to check us in and get us settled. The apartment was spacious and clean — and the view from the wraparound patio was incredible! In addition, it was easy walking distance to pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. I would highly recommend staying here if you’re looking for somewhere to stay in Athens!"
14117432,438809533390873850,2021-08-28,411654123,Søren,"Panos is a really nice and helpful man, and he is easy to get hold of via the AirBnb App.  Panos has everything prepared for us and we get a thorough information about the area<br/><br/>it is a really cozy apartment right in the middle of Athens' inner city.  We quickly felt at home in the apartment and the stunning views from the balcony were enjoyed both morning and late evening.  Especially the view to the Acropolis is absolutely stunning.  <br/>The small streets around the apartment are full of local bars, cafes and restaurants, several of which crowd out in the evening and the locals party well into the night, though without bothering us up on the 5th floor.  If not all, then at least most major sights can be easily reached on foot.<br/>Taxis are easy to get hold of, especially if you use the Beat App and code your credit card into the App.  then the price is always the right one!<br/><br/>Sørensen, Denmark"

It has all the amenities you need and you feel right at home once you step in the door.  The location is great with restaurants, bars, a grocery store and even a Tuesday Farmers' Market with in blocks of the apartment. The neighborhood is quiet but you are within easy walking distance of the major sites, museums, and shopping. <br/>Stephen and Jane"
14117432,451127035999218783,2021-09-14,84946436,Sabrina,We loved the stay at Panos spacious and cosy flat. It’s in the perfect district to walk to all the main sights and for having food or a drink at local bars. We loved having breakfast at the rooftop terrace with a view on the acropolis. We can only recommend this place!

14117432,460611050366220699,2021-09-27,15580352,Christopher,The view is about as good as they come! <br/><br/>And the street the apt is on is super (Website hidden by Airbnb) right next to some very cool bars as well as an quite interesting archeological site. The site is still under development but just reading up on it was cool and you can look into it from the balcony.
14117432,470711133809216596,2021-10-11,556678,Bruno,"I chose this place for its fabulous balcony and the breathtaking view of the Acropolis and Lykavittos hills. I was a bit skeptical at first about the neighbourhood, as it seems to have a lot of abandonded/ruined houses, which made it look a bit unsafe at first glance. But no problem, Kerameikos is an absolutely safe neighbourhood, it is full of trendy and traditional bars, cafés and restaurants (e.g. Blue Parrot, Backyard Gastro Bar) and a lot of people circulate through the streets. Kerameikos is also close to the Psirri neighbourhood which is one of the trendiest areas to eat and have a night out. Panagiotis's place is close to the Kerameikos metro station that has a direct connection from and to the airport using the blue line, which is very convenient. I had to contact Panagiotis twice for some instructions, and each time he responded within minutes. The check-in and check-out was smooth, Panagiotis is very helpful to make the guest's stay a pleasant one. The apartment is exactly as advertised, with a double bed in one room, and a single bed in another room. The kitchen is well equipped, and the washing machine came in handy. A perfect place in a beautiful city. Thanks for all your help Panagiotis, and for providing this comfy place."

14119825,151868206,2017-05-14,127712307,Jennifer,"Place was great for the price compared to other places in Athens I've seen. The furniture is simple but new, all the essentials for cooking are there. Easily walk to the metro or Syntagma directly. Downside is the lack of wifi, and because it's on the ground floor there is no patio - so not a place for someone who plans to relax at home all day - but perfect for tourists who plan to be out roaming but want a clean, nice place.<br/>Gregory and his sister Jenny were both very helpful! I would stay again or recommend to a friend! "

A great apartment somehow in the city centre but feels like a couple of miles out (in a good way) when you're sitting on one of the multiple balconies. 
<br/>The views are amongst the best you could ever ask for. 
<br/>Does it sound like I'm gushing a bit? Well it's all genuine. I loved it. Thoroughly recommended for one day or a good base to stay in Athens for a few days and see everything.
<br/>And did I mention the pool? And the view from the pool? Just... 'thavma'. See it for yourself."
14120252,102473104,2016-09-18,456999,Ryan,"Eleni was an extremely friendly and welcoming hostess!! 
<br/>
<br/>The place is well represented by the photos on the listing.  The pool deck area, shared with her main house, provides a fantastic viewing spot to soak up the Acropolis while enjoying a glass of wine at sunset!  This was our evening ritual as we enjoyed the area all three nights we stayed there.  
<br/>
<br/>Wifi Review: it could be spotty at times as the signal was strongest outside by the pool or on one side of the deck, as we could not get it to work in the main part of the studio.

It's also within walking distance to all kinds of lovely shops, bakeries and restaurants. I always felt very safe even when walking alone at night. <br/><br/>The apartment is modern, sunshiney-happy-bright and beautiful. Eleni has a great eye and the new kitchen and bathroom are designed with great taste, thought and attention to detail. There are terraces wrapping the apartment giving 360 degree views - mountains behind, the Acropolis in front and the ocean beyond. Stunning!<br/><br/>And the bed is SOooooo comfortable! I don't know if you've ever stayed in Athens before but typically the beds and pillows are hard as rocks!  And there are no blankets! Not this one - this bed has a real mattress and it's like slipping into a cloud with a super soft blanket on top. Heaven! <br/><br/>Eleni is the MOST SUPERB AND GENEROUS HOST EVER!!! (Not shouting, just can't underline Lol) I was a very last minute booking but upon arrival (because she knew I was treating myself for my 50th birthday) she had a beautiful basket prepared with fresh baked breads, fruit and wine. A most special reception! Then she showed me the sauna (so relaxing!) and pool, the later which is located on a very private yet sunny terrace with a view of the Acropolis. Amazing!! <br/><br/>I couldn't have imagined just how perfect it all would be!!! <br/><br/>This is a very private and special place and Eleni is the most gracious host!!<br/><br/>Thank you!

<br/>
<br/>The apartment is basic, but everything is available and clean.  Personally, I think the apartment is a bit bigger than it might look on the photo's. There is a private elevator and entrance to the apartment. A large private balcony. The pool area is shared with the family, however, at the time they were on a short holiday themselves. And for colder days, the combination of sauna and pool is available, which was great!
<br/>
<br/>The neighbourhood is very nice, with a lot of cafe's, restaurants and shops. Also, the location is convenient, nearby the main square with good public transport connections to the airport and the harbour. 
<br/>Athens is a great city, but if you have te opportunity, make sure to visit a few of the islands too. 
<br/>
<br/>Last but not least, Eleni and Vassilis are great hosts. They were present to welcome us in the apartment, showed us all area's of the house which we could use and had a lot of great tips regarding cafes, restaurants and island hopping.  As mentioned, they were on holiday during a part of our stay, nevertheless, they arranged contact persons for us in Athens and replied quickly via (Hidden by Airbnb) to all our questions. Moreover, they were present at the time of check out.

14120252,124954412,2017-01-03,42712457,Tilmann,"The equipment in kitchen and bathroom is a bit rudimental. No hairdryer or a wooden spoon for cooking, just to name an example. The pics give a larger impression as the apartment really is and the pool is not at the same level, but a bit downstairs on another terrace. Also the door-locking system is a bit strange.<br/>But thats all about the minus parts. The rest is all a big PLUS !!! First of all: the location is on the TOP of the city. You' ll have plenty of VIEW, VIEW and …. VIEW. From this point you almost see whole Athens. The cityscape is amazing and watching the weather, sun, snow and light changing from mountains top to the sea in the haze is just fantastic. And yes, from the pool terrace there IS an amazing Akropolis view, too. However, the pool was covered due to winter condition and so we did not use sauna and pool in combination. The nice chimney with the open fire always gives you a very cosy feeling of being at home and sitting on the sofa watching the town below as well as the bonfire was truly a hit. We loved our stay! For a couple on visiting the town (all big ""must see"" as well as shops and restaurants close by) a great choice to stay."

The hosts were welcoming and had left us some lovely fruit, beer, wine and juice in the fridge. <br/>The pool was amazing and the roof top terrace was ideal for soaking up the sun. <br/>The apartment is up a large hill and in a residential part of the city close to restaurants, bars and shops. We tried the local fish restaurant recommended by our host which was lovely. There were a number of other restaurants in that area too. <br/>Athens was a great place to visit and the apartment is out of the main tourist area so you experience a more authentic side of the city.

Eleni greeted us with a bottle of white wine by the private pool and was available for tips and questions at all times.<br/>It is an easy walk down to the city center, but beware that the return trip can be very steep and demanding, especially on a hot summer day. However, Uber is working very well in Athens so that is the cheap, simple and efficient solution that we recommend for getting around.<br/>Overall, we absolutely loved Eleni's apartment and would not hesitate to stay again!"

It was super clean, very comfortable and located on the top floor (8th) with great views and a rooftop pool. There was a lift up to the 8th floor in case you’re wondering. Vassilis was very responsive and there were some nice touches such as wine, bread and a few other amenities on our arrival. The neighbourhood was quiet and there were some great restaurants a quick 8 minute walk away. Another great feature of the apartment is the outdoor patios and rooftop pool with fantastic views of The Acropolis. A great apartment I have no hesitation in recommending and I would stay there again."
14120252,263515913,2018-05-12,15032099,Daniel,"This is a great place . The view is absolutely amazing. Very nice and clean. Great for a couple. There is also access to a rooftop pool with another great view . <br/><br/>Communication was very good and responsive . <br/><br/>Note : if you need to wash clothes , the machine is not in the apartment . You will need to give to the host who offered to wash clothes for me if I had needed.<br/><br/>I have stayed at a fair number of air b nBs over the past few years and this was definitely one of my favorites experiences.<br/><br/>I would stay again if I return to Athens ."
14120252,263877271,2018-05-13,86504888,Fabien,"Les échanges avec Vassilis ont été très agréable, simples et efficaces, Tina nous a accueillie avec beaucoup d’énergie, de bonne humeur et de bon conseils, c’était très agréable pour notre arrivée à Athènes.<br/>La maison est très lumineuse avec plusieurs points de vue exceptionnels sur la ville…et alors le rooftop avec la piscine et sa vue exceptionnelle sur la vile, l’acropole et la mer Egée est à couper le souffle. Le quartier est très calme et ombragé et proche de tout. Je conseil cette adresse à tout visiteurs d’Athènes <br/>Encore un grand merci à Vassilis et Tina qui nous ont permis de passer un séjour merveilleux…"
14120252,264952244,2018-05-15,184686106,Indeah,I thoroughly enjoyed my stay from start to finish! From the first greeting I knew I had made the right decision. The place was super clean and the views are breathtaking. The rooftop was a nice touch as well as the private elevator entrance. A huge thank you to Vassilis and Tina for your amazing hospitality! I will definitely recommend your place to any and everyone!
14120252,268440327,2018-05-25,47054521,Vicky,"This is a wonderful apartment - great location, and a rooftop terace with pool that overlooks an amazing view of the  Acropolis is something truly special. Vassilis is also a great host. I can't recommend it enough."
14120252,271323173,2018-06-01,13796530,Sokthan,The place indeed has beautiful views from everywhere. We were often torn between seeing sites and just spending time on one of the lovely terraces. Tina and Vassilis were quite helpful with information regarding transport. The neighborhood was upscale and close to many museums. We even walked to the Acropolis from the flat. A peaceful getaway in the midst of Athens!
14120252,275475067,2018-06-11,46970908,Lexia,"Vassilis's place is amazing and we absolutely loved our time there! The views are stunning! Being on the top floor and having sliding glass doors basically around the entire apartment really makes it. The sunsets are breathtaking!<br/><br/>The location is also very convenient. It is really in the middle of all the action in Athens. You can also easily walk to other neighborhoods and the train is close by too. <br/><br/>Probably the best parts about staying there were the personal touches from Vassilis and Tina and the ease of communication. The bread from the local bakery, Vassilis's olive oil, and the other treats for us to snack on while we were there really made it feel special. Additionally, anytime we had a question they were both very fast to respond and helpful.<br/><br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
14120252,277857041,2018-06-17,4276148,David,"This is a wonderful apartment with absolutely extraordinary views of Athens. Very comfortable, quiet, and restful. Highly recommended!"

14120252,281971063,2018-06-26,60626072,Dave,"My wife and I had an excellent stay at Vasilli's suite. The location is in a very nice neighborhood, where we felt very safe. And although we never met Vasillis personally, his assistant Tina was very accommodating. The apartment was spotless and had very thoughtful amenities. Our only regret was that we didn't have more time for a longer stay!"
14120252,286463670,2018-07-06,48670504,Niels,This apartment is absolutely stunning. It features literally the best view in all of Athens. It is located in a very nice neighborhood with bars and restaurants around. Vassilis is the perfect host and made sure we had an amazing stay.

14120252,300421904,2018-08-02,34783060,Max,"Enjoyed our stay. Location is very safe, quick walk to cafes, laundry, attractions. Panos, Vassilis's assistant was incredibly helpful, gave us great tips to the area and was always available.<br/><br/>The bed was comfortable but loud at night. We also lost power during a thunderstorm and the wifi was hit and miss. Panos was quick to arrive and straighten out any problem we had. "
14120252,308215799,2018-08-16,926816,Alex,The flat got the best view in Athens AND it comes with a pool. Tina was an amazing hostess waiting for us and showing us the flat. So with the exception of rather poor kitchen facilities and equipment we had an absolutely perfect stay.
14120252,310802529,2018-08-20,90100241,Eva,Un séjour au top ! Une vue magnifique sur Athènes de n’importe quel endroit où l’on se trouve depuis l’appartement !<br/>Et cette piscine sur le toit <br/>Nous avons était très bien accueilli dès notre arrivée !
14120252,315504692,2018-08-29,5176944,Steven,"This is a great spot with a great (shared) pool. I loved the area and it is in perfect walking distance from the old centre and Kolonaki. Stunning views. A bit smaller than it appears and check that building works in adjacent building are complete (Aug 2018) or bring earplugs. Vassilis and Tina were great, responsive and engaging hosts! Great sunsets! Beautiful salt water pool!"
14120252,318109131,2018-09-03,72449468,Andrew,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this very unique and private getaway on the hill! We had use of a beautiful private pool of which we took much advantage!<br/><br/>We also enjoyed our morning coffee on the beautiful terrace that offered the most exceptional views of Athens that you can imagine! It was all a bit surreal......<br/><br/>Our hosts left many treats for us including a bottle of wine, yogurt, fresh fruit and bread, juice and coffee. And selfishly, we consumed it ALL!! <br/><br/>They were very prompt with any questions we had about our stay and even scheduled a taxi for our departure.<br/><br/>We enjoyed a scrumptious dinner at a local italian restaurant called La Pasteria where we ate the most delicious Margherita pizza I’ve ever experienced!! <br/><br/>The flat it quite a hike up the hill from the main shopping and restaurant area, but only about a 15 minute walk. <br/><br/>Do yourselves a favor and reserve this Airbnb today!! You will not regret it!!"
14120252,321837089,2018-09-11,1089669,Simon,Amazing place with an epic view on the city. The private pool is definitely the highlight.

14120252,332773268,2018-10-06,199768401,Francesco,"It is a great, quiet and stylish  apartment in the most exclusive area of the city with the a breath taking view over the rooftops and the akropolis. Swimming while looking at the sun setting over the Parthenon is unique .. Vassilis is a great host."
14120252,336189392,2018-10-14,40960063,Eric,"Excellent location in one of the nicest and safest neighbourhoods in Athens, walking distance to city centre and Acropolis. We climbed the small mountain that starts right behind the apartment as a bonus. It’s a lot is stair climbing to get to the apartment from town so beware if your knees aren’t 100 percent! Hosts are very gracious and even did our laundry for us."
14120252,345450193,2018-11-05,66174226,Mette Juul,Skøn lejlighed med tagterrasse og fantastisk udsigt i roligt og centralt beliggende kvarter. Varm velkomst
14120252,430243921,2019-03-30,50242523,Ruslan,"Vassilis, and Tina were very easy to communicate from the beginning. Upon arrival, we were greeted and shown around the house to make sure we knew everything that was available to us during our stay. That includes an in-house sauna, pool with a patio and picturesque view of the Acropolis, and the apartment itself which has fantastic views of the Mount Lycabettus. The apartment was fully equipped with a kitchen where you have a portable stove and oven, fridge, kettle and (of course) a coffee machine. The owners also left some local wine, fresh bread, honey, homemade olive oil and nuts and a few others foods and snacks for us to enjoy during our stay. The rest of the apartment was a nice and open area with an above the floor fireplace, plenty of closet space, and a pull out couch (besides the bed) in case you need more space to sleep. The views of Athens are pure photographic pleasure and a beauty to wake up to in the morning. There are 360 degrees views throughout the apartment and 2 more patios to enjoy at the apartment level. The area itself is a very good at being a walkable distance from the main Athens attraction i.e. the Acropolis, Monastiraki square and Zeus’s temple, but in an area that is not touristy or loud at any point of the day. It’s a nice little piece of a neighborhood on Lycabettus Mount where we were able to enjoy quiet mornings and peaceful evenings throughout our stay. We would definitely come back here to stay again and will suggest this apartment to anyone looking for a relaxing stay in Athens."
14120252,438995979,2019-04-18,115956463,Karim,Appartement très bien placé et calme. L’intérieur est très propre et le lit est hyper confortable. <br/>La vue est incroyable. <br/>Vassilis et Tina sont d’une très grande gentillesse et sont réactifs pour les messages et les conseils. <br/>Ευχαριστώ πολύ
14120252,449154621,2019-05-06,14176101,Wyatt,"Vassilis's stylish penthouse is a perfect base for exploring Athens, with breathtaking views in all directions and a great location in a trendy neighborhood. Tina was absolutely fabulous in helping us getting settled, and was super responsive to all communications. The property has numerous thoughtful touches and wonderful amenities, such a fresh fruit, a complementary bottle of wine, and high quality toiletries."
14120252,451094063,2019-05-11,60393822,Erik,"Wonderful terrace with a superb view, and upon arrival we were greeted with greek wine and olives, which was nice. Communication easy with fast answers. Overall clean and nice apartment."
14120252,454869290,2019-05-19,63170961,Maia,"Great place to stay!! We were greeted by Tina, the property manager, who met us early so we could drop off our bags while the apartment was being cleaned for our stay. She had great tips on where to go, and how to get around. She also had a stocked kitchen for us to snack and make breakfast which was especially gracious of them. Also there’s great views from the apartment and the private rooftop pool. Would definitely recommend!"
14120252,467134243,2019-06-10,167590997,Stephanie,"We had a wonderful stay in this amazing studio with breath-taking  views  all over Athens on all sides. Very warm welcome and a filled fridge awaiting us. Perfect for 2 people but Vassilis and Tina did everything for us to make us 4 feel comofortable, too.<br/>Thank you so much, Tina and Vassilis!"
14120252,475965603,2019-06-25,11793740,Christopher,"I had a lovely time staying here. The apartment itself is small but it is clean & comfortable. It had all the amenities I needed and upon arrival the host kindly stocked the fridge with a few essentials which was nice. The apartment was centrally located with lots of restaurants and shops close by and about a 5-10 minute walk to Syntagma Square. The real feature to this listing is the shared pool area with the most fantastic views of Athens & the Acropolis. In the summer heat, a daily swim was a must. Would gladly stay here again."
14120252,482885616,2019-07-07,121524263,Γιαννης,"Amazing host, amazing location! Even though I am from Athens, I will compact my experience in one sentence... see you next year Vassilis and Tina ;)"

14120252,552229128,2019-10-21,141670499,Antti,Really nice location and a lovely view over Athens. We had very nice two days in Vassilis apartment and Tina hosted us with great hospitality. Highly recommended!
14120252,604713956,2020-02-12,47532,Tika,"Vassilis was a gracious, friendly and polite host however I personally was not a fan of this studio. It is much smaller than it appears on the pictures, the shown view to Akropolis is only from the common roof deck and a few corner spots from the private balcony,  and it is well overpriced for its size and offerings. It is located in an extremely safe area and block of Likavitos/Kolonaki but I personally did not feel safe as a solo female traveler since the studio is inside a small alcove on the building's rooftop with glass all around it. The adjacent buildings are directly connected to the roof.  If the price was lower or the flat larger it would have been a more pleasant stay for me personally. Thank you Vassili for hosting me!"
14120252,669033246,2020-09-28,177994824,Dimitra,Everything was just perfect! I spent my first night after my wedding there and it was everything i hoped for. Highly recommended if you want a beautiful apartment with everything you desire. Congrats to the owner for being such a talkative and communicative individual. I would visit the place again in a heartbeat.
14121543,164720181,2017-06-29,120749984,István,"The two room vas clean and ok. It is Basic accomodation, all promised things is real. Good starting point to see the city center to a couple of days when you dont want to stay a long time in the flat. Stamatis and his wife was helpful and nice people!"

14122237,92765695,2016-08-10,87707714,Alexandre,"We were warmly welcomed and shown into a very clean, well equipped and bright apartment. Great views from the top floor, quiet, easy to connect with trains, buses and taxis from the apartment. All was as expected, if not better. We were quite disappointed to not have the wifi as advertised and this was an inconvenience for us. They did apologies on arrival the wifi was down. "
14122237,93885786,2016-08-14,88523455,Billy,The place is great! The owner was very accommodating and nice. We definitely got our money's worth with this stay. Highly recommend!

14122237,99247352,2016-09-04,92109177,Robin,L'appartement est super et il y a tout ce qu'il faut. Antonis est même venu nous chercher à la sortie du métro. <br/>Il est à 10-15 min de la plus proche station de métro.<br/>Je vous le recommande si vous passez à Athènes.<br/><br/><br/>The apartment is great and there is everything you need. Antonis even met us at the subway exit.<br/>It is 10-15 minutes from the nearest subway station.<br/>I recommend it if you go to Athens.
14122237,99787707,2016-09-05,20466996,John,Loved the underground parking and personal greeting upon arrival. Very secure building with a stunning balcony. Highly recommended!
14122237,100431205,2016-09-09,47455383,Stephan,"we absolutely loved the place! It's was very clean and so secure. Great design, modern and the balcony with Acropolis view didn't hurt :)<br/>It's very spacious, beds are comfortable, couch is huge and can easily be doubled as another bed. <br/>Our hosts were so amazing. We are hoping to come back for another visit. <br/>Thanks for everything"
14122237,101397248,2016-09-13,30967403,Sam,"Unfortunately could not pick us up from the airport as mentioned in the listing, but he told us very early so we could figure out another way, he kindly offered metro/train advice, but we arrived very late and so it was a 40€ taxi. Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive until close to 11pm, but this was no problem. The neighbourhood appears a bit run down at first glance but we soon got pretty comfortable after seeing some smiley faces around, even after dark. We walked into the central City and it took about an hour, we caught a metro the next day and it was about 20 minutes and only €1.40 ea. The apartment felt brand new, everything including washing machine, air conditioning, tv, internet, fridge etc all works perfectly. Overall a very nice apartment (and yes, you can see the Acropolis!) and we would stay again."
14122237,106248751,2016-10-05,84788370,Debbie,Great host.  Great location.  Lovely clean apartment.  Exactly as the pictures show.  Highly recommended.  Will definitely book again when next visiting Athens xx

14122237,111674004,2016-11-01,63292795,Anıl,"We had the greatest time in Antonis' place. It was super luxurious and quite big to accommodate four people easily. The views from both sides of the flat left us speechless. Staying in this apartment truly completed our authentic Athens experience. The apartment is in a safe neighborhood and a little bit off the city center however you can walk everywhere from the apartment if you are walking-lovers like us. It has a great view of Acropolis which made our breakfasts in the terrace more special than ever. The flat is in the 7th floor and there is an elevator, there are alarms in the house which make you feel super-safe, there is heating systems and a/c in rooms. Seriously there is nothing that can disappoint you at all. One last thing about Antonis: He was super cool and helpful, he made everything to solve any problem of ours. We didn't have any communication problems and he was always one phone-text message away when we need any help. I hope more people enjoy his apartment that is suitable to kings and queens."

14122237,114396416,2016-11-18,52330353,Dimitrios,Alles sehr gut und wie auf den Bildern zu sehen. Die große Balkontür der Glastisch und die Stühle hatten paar putzstreifen könnten besser geputzt sein aber akzeptabel. In der Nähe vom Zentrum. Vorm Haus ist die Straße stark befahren daher auch nachts etwas Lärm zum einschlafen aber noch ertragbar.

14122237,147918598,2017-04-29,124066838,Evgeny,"The purpose of the trip to Athens was a competition for children. Housing was chosen according to the principle of close proximity to the place where our competitions were held. The owner is a sympathetic, young, sociable young man who met us late at night. Everything was very cool !!! The bus stop is 100 meters from the house, the metro is very close, many shops and a supermarket nearby."

14122237,153429602,2017-05-21,100650289,Ursula,Wonderful views of the acropolis.. we enjoyed sitting out on the balcony during the evening and early morning. The apartment was within a 5-10 walk of the green metro line. We had previously stayed in Athens closer to the city centre so we didn't mind being a bit further out of the main strip during this stay. Very friendly host.

14122237,155959629,2017-05-29,129320677,Shelby,Antonis is an amazing host. He helped us with transportation and showed us the easiest ways of how to get places. He arranged taxi services when we could not due to our phones not having very good service. The place was as beautiful as in the pictures and the balcony was breathtaking. I would highly recommend staying in this apartment!
14122237,163534275,2017-06-25,28006228,Sil.,"We werden om 21.00u door een vriend van Antonis erg vriendelijk ontvangen.Hij stond ons buiten al op te wachten.En eenmaal aangekomen in het appartement bood hij ons een glaasje koud water aan.Er lag een hele zak met ijsklontjes in de diepvries en er was koffie,thee,crackers,jam (Website hidden by Airbnb) lag fruit op een schaal.<br/>Wat het appartement betreft is alles aanwezig wat je nodig hebt.Zelfs het water uit de kraan is drinkwater.<br/>Wij vonden alleen de matrassen iets aan de harde kant.<br/>Er is op zo'n 650 meter een AB supermarkt en op zo'n 850 meter een Lidl.Heb je direct iets nodig dan kun aan het eind van de straat links naar een 24 uurs minimarket.En op donderdag is er een een grote groente en fruitmarkt een paar straten verderop.Wat ook de moeite waard is de groente en fruitmarkt in de wijk Neo Kosmos op zaterdag.<br/>Neem de metro en stap uit bij halte Neo (Website hidden by Airbnb) kunt ook tramlijn 5 nemen naar zee,dan kom je er langs.<br/>Kortom, Athene is teveel om op te noemen !  Je moet het gezien hebben...!<br/>Bedankt Antonis..!"

14122237,168810872,2017-07-10,129308566,Stephanie,Antonis' apartment was amazing. It was very comfortable and had everything we needed.

14122237,171973990,2017-07-19,128966315,Stephanie,The room was exactly as shown in pictures and exactly what you needed for a few days in Athens. Close to Public Transport or only 5€ to get to the city centre. <br/>Enjoyed our stay here! 
14122237,172947838,2017-07-22,92099604,Bradley,Great apartment in a good location close to the Athens metro.  Excellent value.  Antonis surprised us with fresh fruit and bread for breakfast.  Antonis is a very attentive host.  Stay here - you won't be disappointed.

14122237,183462530,2017-08-17,136966314,Reinier,"I never give a 10. This time I'll give a 10!<br/>I'm a frequent traveler, but new to AirBNB. We travel a lot as a family and my son is getting older (17), so definitly needs his own space. Hotels hardly ever have reasonable family rooms, so booked this apartment through AirBNB.<br/><br/>Our host waited for us at the busstop. Gave us great directions to that busstop.<br/>The apartment was clean. Way more then the usual amenities. e.g. dishwasher, oven, microwave, washer and all the standard amenities. Good airconditioning (two), and two large flatscreen TV's.<br/>Beautiful terrace. There was even a fruitbasket waiting for us. Tea, coffee, milk. All the basic needs when you arrive to relax a bit, before you go to the supermarket.<br/><br/>Busstop very close with frequent busservices. Information however available mainly in Greek. Took us some time to understand the bussystem. Subway is easy, but a 800 meter walk.<br/><br/>I've never stayed in such a beautifull place for that price"
14122237,184197389,2017-08-19,56902306,Jim,Beautiful apartment in a great location.   Thank you Antonis
14122237,188062145,2017-08-28,93792543,Núria,"Bien comunicado,piso comodo,pero tuvimos dificultades para contactar con el propietario y eso nos tuvo nerviosos en numerosas (Website hidden by Airbnb) le hemos podido ver,vino un amigo..muy amable"
14122237,188364270,2017-08-29,120636677,Ryan,"We booked a stay at this property and the pictures and description were accurate. We only stayed one night on a layover flight but it is a very clean and spacious property that overlooks the acropolis in the distance. We were met with fresh fruits and some snacks at check in. The apartment is very well  stocked with maps, food take out brochures, informational brochures and everything you would need to cook for yourselves."
14122237,190400187,2017-09-04,34071949,Jean-Marc,"Super apartment a little outside of main attraction of Athens but frankly, with the public transport you are literally 15 minutes away from everything. Huge outside balcony...apartment on 7th floor with beautiful view of Acropolis. Safe neighbourhood and our host Anthonis even picked us up at the nearby bus station to check in. All in all we really enjoyed our stay and asked Anthonis for 5 more days after our Greek island cruise but the apartment was already rented to someone (Website hidden by Airbnb) WONDER!"
14122237,191857238,2017-09-09,49787817,Judy,"Wonderful view of the Parthenon, especially at night.  Antonis was a great host.  Prompt in communication and had a welcome basket of fresh fruits, bread, etc, for us to enjoy.  Super convenient location to bus from the airport and metro line plus groceries and restaurants/bakeries/etc.  Loved everything about our stay here and HIGHLY recommend others to stay here as well.  Definitely worth the reasonable price!"

14122237,197832798,2017-09-27,143044236,Judith,"The location is not really central but is a 7-10 minute walk to the metro station where we purchased a ticket for 5 days for 9 euro. It was only  3 Stops and you were in the tourist area. However, it was nice to be out of the crowds when you wanted to be. The area where the apartment is has lots of local restaurants within walking distance and felt very safe. The apartment is nicely furnished and has everything you might need for a stay in Athens."
14122237,200376593,2017-10-05,147037996,Tarn,"An excellent place to stay. Clean and with all of the comforts of home, even a washing machine and oven! Antonis was very helpful and replied to queries timeously."

Busverbindingen om de hoek (ook naar luchthaven), metrostation niet ver (en vandaaruit vlot naar alle bezienswaardigheden in de stad)."
14122237,205907368,2017-10-23,20805027,Dorka,The apartment of Antonis is exactly as advertised. His friend picked us up from the airport. When we arrived at the apartment there was lots of fresh fruit and water. Antonis quickly answered all our questions during our stay. The bus to the airport leaves in front of the apartment every 30 minutes and the ride takes about 40 minutes. The metro station is about 10 minutes from the apartment and it is 3 stops to the touristic city centre.

14122237,212295711,2017-11-17,112408220,Thomas,Great apartment with nice view from the big balcony over Athens. The noise of the traffic from the street is loud but typically for a city. Antonis is kindly and answer every question. Apartment ist really cheap.
14122237,213462076,2017-11-21,86577867,Pristine,"Antonis & his friend are EXCEPTIONAL hosts! Hardworking, genuinely nice & sweet people. There’s nothing that they wouldn’t help you with. Although so close to everything the 7th floor flat is on a quite residential street. It is accessible by lift. It is beautiful and very well decorated. It has all the great amenities such as dishwasher, hair dryer, iron, washing machine etc & even has parking. They even provide you basics such as tea, coffee, hot chocolate, milk, sugar, olive oil, fruits, bread, biscuits along with bathroom essentials. The flat can easily sleep at least 5-6 people (2-rooms & an extremely large L shaped sofa). It is well connected - bus stop is half a minute away, a direct bus - X93 brings you straight to this stop in about 45 minutes from the airport. Supermarkets/convenience stores are very close by as well. We had an amazing stay here & would 100% recommend staying here. We would like to specially thank you Antonis for driving us to & fro to pick up dinner essentials and that too very late in the night - was very considerate & kind of you to do. Thank you once again & wish both of you all the best for your future custom."

It is also 2km away from a neighborhood of young professionals (I didn't know what it was called), where there seemed to be many more young Greek people, which was great.  The apartment is just as pictured and Antonis is very easy to communicate with/work with.  This is also really close (1km) away from the subway station, which is the cleanest and easiest to use train system I have ever used!"

Situé dans un quartier populaire parfaitement ""safe"", le logement est neuf, bien équipé avec vue dégagée. L'accès est facile et simple à trouver à pied du métro avec un plan (communiqué par Antonis avant notre arrivée). La place réservée dans le parking couvert est idéale pour la voiture. Tout a été parfaitement organisé grâce à l'excellente communication et la réactivité d'Antonis. Nous recommandons particulièrement notre hôte."

14122237,369064117,2019-01-09,223115074,Johanne,It is a lovely apartment with a view of hills and the Acropolis. The bus from the airport drops you only yards away  and it is a short walk to the metro.
14122237,401825533,2019-01-16,216217536,Despoina,"Το σπίτι του Αντώνη είναι υπέροχο με πολύ καλές παροχές είτε για ζευγάρι, είτε για οικογένεια. Είναι άνετο με τζάκι, πλυντήριο πιάτων & ρούχων, πλήρως εξοπλισμένη κουζίνα  smart TV /Netflix, άριστο ίντερνετ, μεγάλο μπαλκόνι με θέα την Ακρόπολη και πολύ βασικό είναι ο ιδιωτικός χώρος parking. Το κρεββάτι πολύ άνετο με θερμενόμενο υπόστρωμα και τηλεόραση και στο δωμάτιο! Ο ίδιος ο Αντώνης φιλικός, εξυπηρετικός και χαμογελαστός από την πρώτη στιγμή. Άριστη και άμεση επικοινωνία για την άφιξη μας. Μας περίμενε εκεί ενημερωνοντας μας για τα πάντα μέσα στο σπίτι αλλά και για την περιοχή και μας βοήθησε να μεταφέρουμε και τις αποσκευές μας. Είχαμε μια καταπληκτική διαμονή και το προτείνω ανεπιφύλακτα!!!"
14122237,403609729,2019-01-21,20374383,Eli,"Great apartment outside the centre of Athens. We drove here in a rental car and were pleased to have the garage parking, although there was street parking available if you needed it before or after your stay.  Public transit to the centre was really easy by bus and/or subway. The apartment is very stylish and has great amenities- smart tv, fast wifi, washer, dishwasher, juicer (we had great fresh orange juice each morning!), giant refrigerator and freezer, etc.  There is a lift available. The balcony and view are great (the Parthenon lit up at night is beautiful, what a treat to see it from this location!), and there's a beautiful fireplace with logs provided if you're travelling off season.  Gigantic sectional sofa for lounging about, plus a breakfast table and chairs, plus a dining table and chairs, plus table and chairs on the balcony - you can relax anywhere you like. As we'd already stayed in the tourist area of town, we really enjoyed this neighborhood and found some authentic spots to eat (tastier and easier on pocketbooks than anything you'll find in the centre!). Communication with Antonis was great. We made a silly mistake with our navigation to the place and his friend was very kind to wait on us while we found it (very easy to get to if you use the right address!). Thank you Antonis, we would be happy to come back."
14122237,406018547,2019-01-28,62767549,Francis,The house  was perfect and we left very satisfied.<br/>Antonis was very helpfull and gave us all the information we needed.<br/>The apartment had everything and was very clean.<br/>Can't wait to get back to Athens and this place.<br/>Thank you

The location is great, in a pretty safe area and is very close to a few train stops which will take you directly into the city. Also, the host is amazing, communication is very easy and he has great tips that will enhance your trip."

14122237,443463197,2019-04-26,253466753,Annelies,Nice appartment with everything you need. Anthonis is very friendly and helpful. In 20 minutes we were  in centrum Athene by bus And metro. We were happy with the private parking because we heard at the car rental  that it’s not safe for your car to park in the streets of Athens. The only negative in the apartment is the noise from the traffic.
14122237,444050763,2019-04-27,28182676,Karen And Gilles,The apartment was perfect. Thanks so much!
14122237,446824645,2019-05-02,70839533,Elise,A great place to stay while wondering around Athens! Public transit is easy to figure out to get to and fro.
14122237,448338900,2019-05-05,34049244,Δήμητρα,"Το διαμέρισμα είναι πολύ βολικό όσον αφορά τις παροχές καθώς έχει οτιδήποτε μπορείς να χρειαστείς. Σε απόσταση 5 λεπτών περπάτημα βρίσκεις σούπερ μάρκετ, καφετέριες και εστιατόρια. Η επικοινωνία με τον οικοδεσπότη ήταν κάτι παραπάνω από άμεση καθώς ότι κ αν χρειάστηκα ήταν εκεί να βοηθήσει. Η τοποθεσία επίσης δίπλα στην Εθνική με αποτέλεσμα σε 10 λεπτά να είσαι παντού. Καλά το πάρκινγκ σε σώζει εσένα και το αυτοκίνητο σου από  την συνωστισμένη Αθήνα. Με λίγα λόγια μια  σούπερ επιλογή για όποιον θέλει να περάσει κάποιες μέρες στην Αθήνα."
14122237,449968958,2019-05-08,31304980,Egzon,"Adonis was an outstanding host, very hospitable and accommodating. The place was very clean, spacious, and had a great balcony. Highly recommend."

The place was very confortable to stay all day working and relaxing. The apartment is very confortable and sunny, bed was excellent and everything was clean. The sofá in the living room is amazing. During the day it can be a bit noisy due to car traffic, but it was no problem for us. We could relax withought any problem. We will come back!"

It was incredible. <br/><br/>Communication was amazing throughout our stay and even gave us information of the best places to visit. <br/><br/>The place was clean, stylish and quiet. Everything about our stay in the apartment was enjoyable and we did not want to leave. <br/><br/>The location is a bit out of the center of Athens but we preferred it. It was a lot nicer to get a taste of the real Athens without living among tourist! Very quiet and friendly neighbourhood and easy access to the center (via Metro) or the Airport (via bus).<br/><br/>Would highly recommend and will be back to stay here again in the future. Many thanks!"

Da wir Hunger hatten hat er uns zudem noch etwas zum Essen bestellt. Die Unterkunft ist so wie auf den Fotos zu sehen. Der Ausblick vom Balkon direkt auf die Akropolis ist toll, auch wenn die Stadt natürlich insgesamt sehr laut ist. Die Lage ist etwas außerhalb des Zentrums, was für uns aber aufgrund des Mietwagens kein Problem war. Alles in allem ein guter Aufenthalt bei einem freundlichen Host."

He also recommended a great place to eat authentic Greek food which become one of the best meals we had in Greece. I would highly recommend Alexi's place and I look forward to returning.

I'm telling all my friends to book as soon as possible as this place is nearly too good to be true. Perfect location walking distance to everything. Owners are so helpful and even arranged for an early morning van to the airport since the metro only starts at 6am. In the heart of the best part of town with an awesome balcony to sip coffee on before starting your day. Best experience, bar none, of all airbnb. Everything is brand new and modern, spotless and perfect. I can't say enough. Comfy beds, ample hot water, laundry machine, secure location this place had it all. Some times things that seem to good to be true are true and this was one of them. Drinking water provided, coffee and tea and sugar, provided --Thank you!"

Throughout the 5 days stay in Athens, we had not use any public transport to any tourist attraction at all, except we decided to go to ""The Mall"" by Metro. However, the Metro is closed due to strikes but we managed to use the bus  which took us longer time instead of Metro. Metro and bus station is just a the back of the apartment.<br/>The apartment is located just beside the shopping street but it is still quiet in the entire day. I am a light sleeper and there is no problem for me. At the surrounding, you can find any restaurants you desired, local Greek food, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, McD, KFC, coffee shops, and more. <br/> <br/>Antonis (Host's helper) is very friendly and Alexis has given all the direction to the apartment 2 weeks before the stay and no problem for us to find the apartment. Antonis recommended us the restaurant he use to go to (even met him there) for local Greek food and where to go for groceries shopping for breakfast or if we wanted to cook.<br/><br/>The apartment is very spacious and modern, there is TV in every rooms and 3 bathrooms which is very convenient if there are group of people staying together. Kitchen is equipped with the utensil and cookware needed. Antonis even has prepared several bottles of drinking water and fruits for us. Every rooms has air conditioning and ceiling fan, I guess there will be no problem even staying during in the hot summer in Athens, although we only used the heater on the air conditioning as the temp is 5~15C during our stay in Athens.<br/><br/>The elevator is a bit small but sufficient to fit 4 big baggage and 3 cabin baggage with 1 person in 1 go. It is a old style elevator but still serve its purpose. :) <br/><br/>Antonis and many (even the libraian in Greece National Library) have warned us to be careful about pickpocket but we are lucky and nothing bad has happened as we stayed alert if anyone come close."

14128387,136319891,2017-03-10,15798848,Martin,"Just PERFECT. <br/><br/>Location - 3 minites from the metro line which goes to the airport; 10 meters from one of the main shopping streets,  close to restaurants,  bars, etc., but still it's very quiet. Main historic sites are at walking distance. <br/>Cleanliness and comfort -  it was perfectly clean and you sleep like a baby on a very comfortable beds. There is one pull-out sofa,  so it could accommodates 7 people (as in our case). You can find everything you need in the kitchen if you want to prepare a fresh fish (bought directly from the fishermen). You have linens,  towels (a lot), iron, washing mashine... Everything you need even for a longer stay. <br/>Alexi and Antonis are very helpful,  you receive every instruction you need way in advance;  they also allowed us to leave our luggage earlier than the check-in time (really appreciate that) and<br/> recommended to us couple of places,  which are really good (but I would say that it's better to book a table in bar Noel if you don't want to wait). <br/><br/>Whoever stays there won't regret it.

14128387,136692472,2017-03-12,112978724,John,"This Airbnb rocks. There's no other way to really describe it. It's obvious that a lot of work went into renovating and designing this space for an Airbnb because it's uniquely modern and comfortable. Having three bedrooms and three bathrooms was a real treat for our group. Especially after recently staying at an Airbnb in Greece with only one shower :) <br/><br/>The location is very convenient and is walking distance to a lot of restaurants, shops, the flea market and about an 18 minute walk to the Acropolis. Unfortunately, it rained the entire time we were there, but it gave us a lot of time in the Airbnb :) <br/><br/>Each of the three rooms has cable tv, a fan, AC/heater, bathroom with a shower, extra towels and blankets, and more. It really felt like we were staying in a hotel or something! There's also a washer/dryer combo, which was great to have after getting soaked in the rain. The house is also stocked with water bottles, fresh fruit and even fresh flowers! <br/><br/>Overall, we really enjoyed our time at this Airbnb and we will definitely stay there again if we return to Athens!"

However, be aware that the elevator in the building is very old-fashioned; it has a manual door and no gate, so take care when using.  Alexi and Antonis are very detail-oriented and highly responsible hosts - always in contact and helpful.  Thanks for a great stay, guys! "

We arrived tired and at night, which was great to meet Alexi's cousin who lives local to show us the place. They did a great job renovating the apt, feels very NYC with all the updates. I was literally only in the place for about 4 hours to sleep, and the place is huge. My friend and I booked it when really it would be comfortable for up to 6 people. The only thing was the floors make noise when walking every step. If you're a light sleeper that might bother you, otherwise love the place. "

14128387,168186978,2017-07-09,68102189,Justin,Our stay was great. Alexi had excellent communication and made us feel very welcome. 
14128387,168683913,2017-07-10,32926068,Michele,"Bel appartement au coeur d'Athènes avec une literie et des salles de bains haut de gamme. La communication avec Alexi a été aisée, précise et efficace. Son cousin nous a donné des conseils et des adresses précieuses.<br/>Michèle"
14128387,169349776,2017-07-12,89930394,Emma,Alexi and the apartment are both phenomenally fabulous. Could not have had a better experience!
14128387,169851396,2017-07-14,78947,Jay,"Having been to Greece before several times, this flat is located in the most central, amazing location. Steps away from the Syntagma square presidential guards (the changing of the guards ceremony occurs every hour) and the Syntagma metro stop (one stop away from the Acropolis).  It is 15 steps off of Ermou St. which is Athen's version of Fifth Ave. in NYC (top high-end shopping) and located in the same building as Voulis cafe (top rated resturant by Bon Appeitete magazine). The best part is that you don't sacrifice location for quality!  The apartment was fully equipped and comfortable for our family of four but can easily sleep more with the three full bathrooms. Alexi and his cousin Adonis were super helpful.  Adonis gave us great tips for places to visit.  He showed us before and after photos of this apartment.  He literally tore this apartment down to its studs and refurbished it with the same furnishings and upgrades you would find when building a new home in the USA.  Thanks for such a wonderful visit to Athens!"
14128387,170229290,2017-07-15,59481081,Bernard Et Pascale,"Appartement très bien, spacieux, fonctionnel, très bien situé au centre ville, plaka et acropole . Quartier  très  animé mais pas un bruit depuis l'appartement, nuit tranquille. "
14128387,173200921,2017-07-23,26944788,Caitlin,"Athina'a Hideaway, Alexi and Antonis are amazing! Our group of 6 stayed there for two nights. It was not hard to find, perfect location, super clean, and perfect for us! Antonis met us late at night and stayed to help us answer questions and give great suggestions. Highly recommend!"
14128387,175069573,2017-07-28,19342080,Theodore,"Large, centrally located apartment, wonderfully furnished and really, honestly, truly air conditioned (it was 99 F one day, and we were very comfortable). Very quiet, spectacularly comfortable beds, luxury hotel-style showers. Fully furnished and easy-to-use kitchen. At the edge of the Plaka, great restaurants, including a wonderful vegan place (Avocado), convenient grocery store on Mitropoleos, about 20 minutes by foot to the Monastiraki flea market, a short cab ride to the Acropolis. Right at the start of Lonely Planet's walking tour of central Athens. I'm not sure you could do better in the middle of a major city."
14128387,176460679,2017-07-31,60820273,Riham,"The apartment is very clean, equipped, modern, quiet and in a perfectly central location. Alexi the owner who lives in the USA  was very responsive by email and also his cousin who lives in Athens was very helpful and responsive. We were 4 adults and 2 kids who were 3 years old and the house was big enough for us all. Just one comment to keep in mind, if you are someone who needs darkness in your bedroom to sleep , the rooms have rather light curtains (and there are no wood shutters like the ones commonly in Europe).  I ended up using an eye cover, but next time will take my suction black out curtains if i was to stay there again."
14128387,177972560,2017-08-04,58019046,Patrik,"Great location, had everything you need for a nice central home base in the heart of Athens."

14128387,181646356,2017-08-13,77377700,Nicole,Great location and very nice apartment. We loved staying here! Would highly recommend
14128387,182631145,2017-08-15,72908643,Sarah,"This apartment is in a great location, within walking distance to both Plaka and Syntagma square.  We stayed here with our five children and mother and were all very comfortable.  The air conditioners worked great and it was also quiet despite the busy streets below.  The apartment is on the 6th floor.  I chose to use the stairs each day to get to the apartment as the elevator was too small for my claustrophobic mind (LOL).  We would stay here again."
14128387,183308667,2017-08-17,36621894,Zaakia,Athena's Hideaway exceeded my expectations. This place was perfect for getting all around the city center. The apartment was clean and spacious. Bathrooms were the typical size of European spaces (tight) but very nice. Beds were comfortable. Host left water in the fridge for us. We felt secure and the instructions were fairly straightforward. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.
14128387,184510893,2017-08-20,5183592,Drew,"My wife and I have stayed in Athens many times, both in hotels or AirBnBs. This is my favorite lodging by far in our 10 years of coming to this city. <br/><br/>First the location is excellent. You are close to the metro, within walking distance to most of the fun tourist destinations in the city, and you can easiy get a cab at any hour of the day from Syntagma. The building is beautiful and is on a great street. The apartment itself is very modern, clean, and comfortable. The rooms are very large and having two on-suite bedrooms is great for a big group. The balcony is really nice in the evenings too. <br/><br/>Alexi was beyond accommodating. We messaged back and forth several times and he was very helpful, polite, and hospitable. We traveled with my parents, sister, and 8 month old, and everyone felt at ease and were beyond impressed with our stay here. If you're looking for a nice spot right in the middle of Athens, I cannot recommend this highly enough."
14128387,186010705,2017-08-23,1907043,Mario,Appartamento molto curato e centralissimo. Dotato di ogni comfort. Molto utile la mappa su (Hidden by Airbnb) map fornita da Alexi con tutte le indicazioni su ristoranti e locali.<br/>Consigliatissimo.
14128387,188577474,2017-08-30,70795233,Simone,"Great apartment with all the amenities, great location, great for families! Special thanks to Antonis!"
14128387,188994833,2017-08-31,31216672,Christina,"The unit was exactly as described! Excellent location within walking distance to the Acropolis. Step right out the door and you are right in the middle of tons of restaurants and shopping. Communication was easy and fast with the hosts. To note: the elevator in the building is quite narrow so beware if in a wheelchair, and the sofa bed is a little tight for 2 adults which is okay if you're a couple but maybe uncomfortable if you're friends."
14128387,189563825,2017-09-02,4491847,Orit,"Biutiful apartment, large, perfect location, will defenetly come back and recommend my friends"

14128387,192739762,2017-09-11,36068466,Danielle,We had an amazing stay at Alexi's! Not one bad thing to say about this place. It is the most perfect apartment in the heart of the city. We could walk everywhere and there are so many great restaurants and bars nearby. It is ideal for a large group (we were 8). The beds are super comfortable (even the couch) and the apartment is very homey and clean. Check-in and communication was so easy! Highly recommend! Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks again Alexi and Antonis!
14128387,195592541,2017-09-20,70928789,Ferman,"The apartment had an attractive advertisement on Airbnb and it turned out exactly as presented.  Ideal location, especially if you like shopping and people watching -- 5 stories up with balcony for light and little street noise.  Neat, clean and well-organized; it's very nice to have the three comfortable bedrooms, each with a full bathroom and plenty of hot water  (individual TVs and AC units). Self check-in was quick & efficient; host was very responsive.  Bottom line -- highly recommended!"
14128387,196373138,2017-09-23,5947332,Lisa,"We were 7 ladies on a girls trip to mykonos and santorini and were transitting in Athens. Alexi's place were perfect option being so centrally located very close to the shopping area, restaurants and bar. The atmosphere is so lively. Not to mention we love the apartment decor. Antonis were extremely helpful with any queries. Best airbnb experience I ever had."
14128387,196826211,2017-09-24,1201315,Kirsten,"Alexi's apartment is a great spot for a larger group. The location is perfect: it is right in the middle of everything, so very easy to get around, and there are lots of cafes and restaurants nearby. Alexi was a fabulous host: incredibly easy to communicate with and very accommodating of our requests. Our only (very minor) complaint was that the cleaner was there for a few hours after we checked in, but apart from that everything worked really well."
14128387,197349032,2017-09-25,99228039,Jean Paul,Alexi was able to help us out with a last minute stay in Athens. Is location was perfectly located near the main shopping area and a few blocks from both the main station and the center of town.
14128387,197790920,2017-09-27,104398641,Wes,Alexi's place was perfect for our family of 5.  The place itself was very clean and in a perfect spot to explore the city.  You have great shopping and restaurants right out your door.  Great place to stay when visiting Athens!
14128387,198709633,2017-09-30,22656296,David,Great stay in a great location. Would highly recommend this property.

14128387,202415296,2017-10-11,7869769,Roee,Beautiful apartment in the best location in town!<br/>Alexi responded almost immediately to every question we had and is a great host. When we will return to Athens on our next trip we will most likely stay here again.
14128387,204212807,2017-10-17,62820913,Paul,"Alexi's Hideaway is a wonderful 5th floor, 3 bedroom apartment in the middle of Athens.  It's 15 minutes from the Acropolis, it's in the middle of restaurants, stores, and 5 minutes from the Syntagma Metro.<br/><br/>Alexi was very communicative in all of the advance work.  I had one problem reaching him once we arrived, because we couldn't find the information on the wifi-passwords.  In fairness, after I checked my e-mails I found that he had sent it to me long before we arrived, so that's on us.  But I e-mailed him through Air B'n'B messaging but didn't hear back during our three days.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is a terrific apartment and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to visit and site-see in Athens."
14128387,208345364,2017-11-01,45104651,Christina,"This place was exactly as the pictures described it! It was warm, cozy and full of perfect little touches! <br/>The warm showers were perfect after a long flight and full day in Athens! I would highly recommend this beautiful home and it’s perfect location."
14128387,212275701,2017-11-17,17425,Jesus,"Excellent apartment in a great part of town. Very easy to get to from the airport using public transportation. The beds are very comfortable and everything was very clean and well kept. Many restaurants, museums and souvenir shops within walking distance of the apartment."
14128387,212815430,2017-11-19,47645152,Imran,"This is a great place to stay as the location is so close to the main sites and metro. Everything is walking distance and within 1 minutes you are at syntagma square, highly recommend. Even had a problem with the internet but was fixed the next morning, Alexi has a very fast response time and makes sure everything is in check!"
14128387,213231102,2017-11-20,29737488,Mitch,"This space is unreal! It worked perfectly for my crew of 7. While this place was extremely clean and easy to find, my favorite feature was the location. It was about a 15 minute walk to the Acropolis, right in the heart of several decent restaurants and very safe. I would highly recommend!"
14128387,213797416,2017-11-23,157063554,Sharon,A fabulous stay at a equally fabulous apartment. The pictures accurately depict this beautiful apartment that has a perfect location close to everything. We were thrilled with our entire experience  — from the ease of communication to check in to the accommodations to check out. Thanks!
14128387,214586946,2017-11-26,26004124,Chandler,"My family of six had a wonderful stay.  We felt so lucky to have such a spacious, clean, and modern apartment in such a great location.  <br/><br/>Communication - Our hosts were always responsive, polity, and helpful.  I couldn't ask for more.<br/><br/>Accommodations - The apartment is very large, modern, and clean.  We used all three bedrooms, as well as the couch bed in the living room.  It was also great having three (!) bathrooms.  The combo washer/dryer was also great for our family of six, as we had quite a bit of laundry, and this allowed us to travel much lighter since we didn't have to carry unique clothing for each day of the trip.<br/><br/>Location - I loved the energy in the city around the apartment.  There was so much good food, shopping, and it's just a great place to walk around while being completely safe.  My son and I strolled around the neighborhood without a map, and encountered the cathedral, Hadrian's gate, the walls of the acropolis, Syntagma square, and more.  We even walked from the National Archaeological Museum to the apartment one late afternoon, and it wasn't bad at all.<br/><br/>In summary, we highly recommend the apartment!"
14128387,216153095,2017-12-03,132435341,Ioanna,We loved it!! Everything was just perfect ❤️

14128387,223325610,2018-01-01,13156414,Sandeep,"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC<br/>This place is truly a gem in many regards: Ideal location (10 min walk to Acropolis) and all major sites. We walked the entire city to uncover/discover our own path.<br/>The apartment has a great US feel to it with modern furnishings, each of the 3 rooms has it's own full bathroom, highly functional kitchen with dishwasher, a clothes washer/dryer was a great benefit so we could travel light.<br/>The building that the apartment is in is highly secure and away from any riff/raff. Cafe's below open early if you need an early jolt of caffeine. If you are like me, you probably want caffeine before wearing your shoes to go out. The kitchen was great in that regards<br/>The place was absolutely clean. plenty of towels and extra bed sheets/blankets.<br/>Each room is equipped with it's own A/C (cool/heat) unit so each room can be regulated on it's own<br/>A cute balcony overlooking the street is fun in the morning as the city starts waking up<br/>The apartment windows were surprisingly noise cancelling. Ermou St is a very busy pedestrian shopping lane and the moment you step outside (on the street) you are immersed in the energy. The moment you step inside the apartment, the noise disappears (nice job with that Alexi/Antonis)<br/><br/>Having traveled around the world a bit and having stayed in Apartments/hotels, this apartment is definitely in my top-5 experiences. Antonis, the property manager in Athens is FANTASTIC. Fast communicator, great to work with, very very responsive and just a great human being.<br/><br/>My one suggestion: if you are going to arrive at the apartment after 2am or leaving the apartment after 2am, you may want to coordinate with Antonis ahead of time so you are not locked in/out<br/><br/>I'm definitely recommending this place to my family and friends and if travels ever bring me back to Athens, this is where I'd stay for sure."
14128387,226176305,2018-01-09,16491106,Julian,Beautifully renovated and fantastically located apartment right in the heart of Athens. It was a perfect base for us to explore the city with our two teenage children.
14128387,226932927,2018-01-13,125020787,Sima,"The host was very nice and friendly, he help us a lot and was always available. <br/>The apartment was very clean and pleasant. The location was perfect. <br/>We strongly recommend to book your stay here!!"
14128387,228763482,2018-01-21,16208349,Lucila,"Alexis place was beautiful, very spacious and luminous. We are a family of 5 and were all very comfortable in the big rooms and common areas. Everything was clean and new, and equipped with everything one might need. We loved our stay there, the apartment being very close to the main sights of the city, and on a lively street, near to the big stores. They provided us with everything we needed, and gave us some very good tips on places to shop, eat, etc. "
14128387,232935122,2018-02-07,5096336,John,"There are so many positive things about this apartment. The other reviews really say it all (that's why we chose it). <br/>For us (a group of 7) it was ideal in size (3 bedrooms & a sofabed, 3 bathrooms).  The kitchen is very well equipped but we didn't cook - just used the kettle and microwave a few times.<br/>A key plus is the location. 30m from the main pedestrian street and just a couple of minutes from Syntagma Square.<br/>We had a great time here!"
14128387,234787915,2018-02-14,152889308,Paulo,"Hospitalidade,  resposta rápida ás minhas questões, localização excelente, não vai precesar de andar de transportes públicos para visitar Atenas.<br/>Apartamento enorme."
14128387,238585191,2018-02-26,146815405,Natalie,"Beautiful apartment in the perfect place! Clean, comfortable, and convenient. Stayed for almost 2 weeks with my family and couldn't have been more satisfied. The kitchen was fully equipped, which I really appreciate when traveling with children- and close to a couple of supermarkets. Not to say there weren't numerous wonderful restaurants just steps away. Also located just a short walk from Plaka. It is located in the center of the shopping district Flea Markets are a short walk away, Museums are also extremely close by. There is plenty of things to do in the area. The only thing that this place did not have was private parking. But I will say this, there are many parking lots available in the area and renting a car like we did is not necessary, unless you want to travel to the countryside or down to Sounio to visit the Temple of Poseidon."
14128387,239296430,2018-03-01,172026149,Jiang,"This is a good trip, the landlord is very welcoming, the room facilities are complete and very hygienic, with free fruit and help us to store the luggage."
14128387,240995277,2018-03-07,44740268,Joe,One of the best Airbnb apartments I have stayed at. Excellent location and apartment is very comfortable. Bathrooms are nice and modern. Alexi and Antonio are extremely attentive to any communication. It was a true pleasure to have picked this apartment. I hope to stay again. Thank you!!!!
14128387,242003350,2018-03-11,66053878,Sarah,"We had an amazing stay at Athens Hideaway. Great location and apartment, very spacious. Suited us perfectly. One small thing if you are in the front bedroom you will need earplugs as the road is a little noisy! I would recommend for anyone going to Athens in a group of 4 to 6. It was my first Air BnB so pleased it was successful!  Sarah and Friends"
14128387,243483382,2018-03-16,159601990,Effrat,"Great location, awesome apartment :)"
14128387,244660970,2018-03-19,21424647,Nate,"This apartment is great, mostly because it could be used for a variety of purposes or travelers. In our case, we had a couple and two friends, so the three bedrooms and bathrooms were perfect for our needs. There was space to sit outside, the living room was stylish and, most important, the location is ideal. Right at the intersection of Monastiraki and Plaka, access to transportation, shopping, and the Acropolis area is within easy walking distance.  <br/><br/>Our only very slight issues - that we felt are worth mentioning but are in no way dealbreakers - were a homeless man sleeping just outside the apartment building entrance both nights we stayed. He posed no threat or harm, but it does seem worth mentioning. Additionally, the second bedroom had a slightly bothersome humming noise. For the light sleepers out there, this room would likely not be appropriate. <br/><br/>Those small issues aside, we had great interactions with Alexi and his cousin, they were flexible with our arrival, and the apartment itself could not have suited our needs any better. Five stars."
14128387,245906200,2018-03-24,36749100,Jasmine,Loved the hospitality and the apartment. It’s the perfect location. It’s modern and perfect for families or groups of couples. I would stay here again!
14128387,246377263,2018-03-25,51544316,Peggy,Great space with perfect location.  Wonderful bathrooms.  Highly recommend.
14128387,247084901,2018-03-27,36749100,Jasmine,"Stayed with Alexi twice while visiting Greece. The apartment is absolutely stunning with modern updates. It has good room separation which works well for adult friends or families. His place is located in one the hippest parts of town. It’s a close walk to all major attractions including the Acropolis, bars, nightlife and shopping. I would highly recommend this place and have personally made it my favorite place to stay in Athens!"
14128387,248701730,2018-04-01,56762148,Abraham,"Our group of 6 stayed there for a few nights. It was very easy to find the apartment just steps away from the Syntagma square. It is the perfect location and super clean. The 3 bedroom and 3 bathrooms was perfect for our group. The apartment has been beautifully furnished and feels very modern and comfortable. It is in a very central location, and we were able to walk to restaurants and tourist attractions. The location is wonderful and surrounded by cafes, restaurants, and plenty of shopping. We walked easily to all the sites we wanted to see and the public transportation was also close to the apartment. There was a problem with the water heater, but it was resolved in the same day. Alexi and Antonis were excellent hosts and we would not hesitate to return. Overall, this was a perfect place for a stay in Athens!"
14128387,249410818,2018-04-02,50360757,Niclas,"Alexi was really great in preparing our stay in this great appartment. The location could not have been better and the additional information that were provided were really great and helpful and even the check-in was flexible.<br/>Unfortunately, we could not find enough towels and bed linen for all people so some had to spend the night a little cold and couldn't shower the next morning.<br/>Also the door code provided was not correct. However, I am sure that both things can easily be adjusted."
14128387,250809634,2018-04-06,76179677,Lisa,"This was our first visit to Athens and we were blown away by the location of this apartment.  We were in the heart of the action, within walking distance of everything you would need to see in Athens, including public busses, restaurants and tourist attractions.  Even my 4 year old could walk everywhere we wanted to go. We called Alexi a couple of times and he was available immediately with all the information we needed and even offered to be at the door within 5 mins if needed.  <br/>The apartment was clean, comfortable and stylish. All 3 bedrooms had their own bathroom and the kitchen had everything we needed. The tv had built in Netflix which was a huge bonus for the evening. <br/>If you're looking to stay in Athens and want to stay in the perfect location with amazing hosts, we highly recommend this apartment.  <br/>Thank you for a wonderful stay."
14128387,252343275,2018-04-10,29697617,Danielle,"Alexi’s apartment was simply amazing. He has thought of every creature comfort to make guests feel welcome and comfortable. We especially liked: three beds and bathrooms, all with great dresser and closet space including spacious bathroom drawers so we could put everything away; well-equipped kitchen with coffee so we didn’t have to find a place early in the morning; super convenient location—we were able to do an activity and come back to the apartment for a quick refresh before heading back out; stylish decor and comfortable linens. You will not regret booking Athena’s Hideaway for your Athens stay. Highly recommend!"
14128387,253019631,2018-04-13,168978929,Santosh,We really enjoyed our stay here! The apartment is clean and spacious and ideal for groups/families that are traveling together. The location is very central to all the attractions as well. The host was very responsive on text messages throughout our stay.
14128387,254552572,2018-04-17,8891469,Juris,"The apartment is great in all means for a travelling group of 6 people. We were 2 couples + 1 and it was perfect. Three separate bedrooms with separate bathrooms, all necessary equipment for living, clean & tidy, brilliant location - all main attractions & restaurants just underneath. No metro use needed, just a wonderful walks. Host provided a very good advice's, responded immediately to all questions and solved all maters. Most recommended."
14128387,255603056,2018-04-21,6839726,Itai,Great clean and big apartment. <br/>The best location in AThens
14128387,258003051,2018-04-28,14350054,Penny,"The apartment was exactly as described and the area was very central and safe.  It was very clean and there was plenty of everything that we could need.  This included  good bath products.  It was really nice to have several bottles of mineral water in the fridge for our arrival and the apples were also a bonus.<br/>The very efficient double glazing meant that we didn't experience street noise when the balcony doors were closed. It was good to have both a ceiling fan and air con in each room. We certainly needed it.<br/>The cafes immediately at the entrance didn't cause any issues with noise and they made an excellent iced cappuccino.  It was a couple of minutes walk to the metro and stop 1 for 'the hop on and hop off' tourist bus.  A quick walk across the square and you are in the National Gardens or watching the changing of the guard at the Parliament building.  Most attractions were really within walking distance,  even for us.  It's worth the interesting walk through the flea market area to the Agora any day of the week.  The Acropolis Museum is fabulous as well and with a walk through parts of the Plaka en route.<br/><br/>A great place to stay."
14128387,259046147,2018-04-30,47080558,Rory,What an awesome find. So central. Secure. Safe. Clean. Awesome hosts. Excellent check-in. Communication outstanding. Brilliant (Hidden by Airbnb) maps tips.  This is THE address to stay in central Athens.

This beautiful, three bedroom, three bath apartment is in the center of the center of Athens.  We walked to all the key sites easily.  Great hosts, responsive and knowledgeable about the area.  We will most definitely be back!"
14128387,273438657,2018-06-06,66254429,Carol,Perfect location!  Alexi provides an amazingly detailed map of some of the best restaurants and things to do in Athens. He is very helpful with advice of how to get to the Airbnb. It is a very central location that is walkable to anything you could possibly want to do in Athens.
14128387,274846277,2018-06-10,4853904,Bernd,"The Apartment was great:  All new washrooms and kitchen, really well located in the downtown core, shops and restaurants nearby.  The lift comes in handy to get to the 5th floor.  Alexi was a perfect host, we can only recommend him and the Apartment highly!"
14128387,281666031,2018-06-25,167575141,Stuart,"Our party of 6 (one couple + one family of 4 with two teenagers) had a great time staying here.  The location is stellar.  There are two cafes on ground floor that are good places to grab a quick bite or drink.  You walk out and shortly down to the left and there is an active pedestrian mall area that is good for shopping, eating and people watching.  The Plaka district is very close by.  Alexi gives wonderfully comprehensive information on the surrounding area including some food recommendations.  There is a moderately active street below so you may hear some noise, especially if you are in the bedroom adjacent to the street as I was versus the other 2 buried deeper within the unit, but I had no issues with it.  That's part of the excitement of city life.  The unit is far enough up and well-insulated enough to dampen a lot of that noise....plus, I always run a white noise app on my phone while sleeping anyway.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, we were being tourists and out seeing the sights the majority of the day/night, but the unit had everything we needed when we arrived back at the end of the day.  The place is spotlessly clean.  The rain-head showers are fantastic and spacious.  Linens, soap, toilet paper and laundry detergent were all provided + a few unexpected extras (a few bottled waters in fridge, bowl of apples).  The coffee urn and instant coffee were nice to use while waiting on others to wake up.  I did have to use (Hidden by Airbnb) Translate to figure out the language on the all-in-one washer/dryer unit plus some deductive reasoning (make sure the cycle you select on the dial has the sunshine icon lit to have it dry the load after it washes).<br/><br/>I strongly recommend staying here.  It is a great, centralized vantage point from which you can visit all that Athens has to offer."
14128387,282036749,2018-06-26,96605174,Katie,We booked very last minute because we needed somewhere to stay in Athens before our 6am departure from the airport. The place was spacious and well decorated and clean. In a good area with lots of food options nearby. Alexi was great with communicating remotely and his cousin met us at the building because we arrived late outside of the check-in window. <br/><br/>My group really liked having individual rooms with private bathrooms. We would stay here again!
14128387,285598223,2018-07-04,813102,Michael,"Alexi was an outstanding host with great communication and accommodation. The place was a perfect home-base in Athens. It was clean, convenient, well-appointed, located ideally, and had incredibly effective A/C and wifi. Highly recommend it!"

14128387,294432192,2018-07-22,4129095,Géraldine,Very centrally located and spacious. One aircon is very noisy and might need fixing. The flat was not ready when we arrived but Alexi was flexible for the check out time. 
14128387,297526518,2018-07-28,104409759,Victoria,Alexi’s place was the perfect spot for a quiet place to stay in Athens. Even with the the busy streets everywhere it is so quiet and calm in the apartment. The place was extremely clean and comfortable. Alexi was very quick to respond if we needed anything. We checked out a little later as we ate in the cafe downstairs and Alexi was extremely accommodating. Beautiful place to stay in Athens.

Various places are within walking distance from Alexis apartment. The view was great as well. The place was spotless although the cleaning lady was there 30 min after we were supposed to check in.

The place is perfect for our family of 5 adults.<br/>We had a couple of questions regarding the washing machine and Antoniou contacted us through FaceTime Audio to help us right away.

One bedroom with it's own sizeable bathroom and shower. Kitchen and living room beautiful laid out. Though elevator is a trip, old school<br/>Having not but one coffee shop on lobby floor, but two is amazing if you need your caffeine fix. For center city dwelling, it just doesn't get ant better!"

The apartment was an easy metro ride from the airport to Syntagma Square and then less than ten minutes walk. Antonis was a great host, he looked after us really well and made himself available at a moment’s notice when needed. My only suggestion for an improvement would be to provide more detailed and accurate information about the workings of the apartment, but this was a minor detail. We would definitely stay at Athina’s Hideaway any time we are in Athens in the future."

14128387,433741175558608007,2021-08-21,128173310,Chester,"The location is absolutely perfect, with easy access to the metro, the parliament building and many places to eat, markets and 10+ minute walk to Acropolis.  Having elevators to take us up after a long, hot day of walking around is very welcome.  The A/C inside each room and the main living area is indeed a welcome addition as is having 3 bathrooms, though we found it odd that throwing toilet paper in the toilets was prohibited (need to use rubbish bin).  Clean and tidy place but expect a bit of street noise given central location, especially bedroom facing street and living room.  Still, we all generally slept well due to reasonably decent sound insulation.  All in all, a solid place to stay when visiting Athens with very responsive hosts.  <br/><br/>Things specific to our stay: 1) we experienced a swarm of ants in the kitchen rubbish bin the very first morning of our stay (we checked in late the evening prior so didn’t check this). While it was taken care of promptly while we went out exploring, it wasn’t a pleasant experience for us or our young children.  2) the check in code we were provided for the front door was incorrect.  Thankfully the host responded immediately with a new code. 3) the TVs, while being smart TVs, were unable to use Netflix or other subscription programs and wouldn’t allow us to update the included Netflix apps or connect to the wifi/internet - not sure why.  Not a huge deal to us but should be fixed for future."

As three ladies travelling through Greece, this place was a nice break from the cramped, expensive hotel rooms on the rest of the trip. We had our own rooms, WORKING, COLD air conditioning (!!!) and the showers were amazing. The location couldnt have been better, walking distance from all the sights and hip nightlife. Would 100% come back and recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Athens!"
14128387,446838815949479096,2021-09-08,19914970,Anastasia,"Alexi’s place is the perfect location for exploring the heart of Athens by foot or public transportation. No need for a car in this area! The apartment is perfect for three friends, or three couples. Everyone has their own bedroom and bathroom (a rarity in Central Athens!). The kitchen is well equipped for basic food prep, coffee, etc. Cannot recommend highly enough!"

The apartment is very stylish and extremely spacious.  The 3 identical bathrooms were great to have.  Couldn’t have been better located, for Plaka, Monasteraki and Syntigma square.  Would definitely recommend  "

Apartment is very good, clean and neat. Metro is very near. There are hell lot of restaurants surrounded by apartment. Car rental companies( sixt, avis, Europe car) are also very near. I recommend if some one wants stay in Athens they can chose Kwnstantino apartment. Overall it was fantastic."

<br/>E' stata molto gentile e premurosa, ci ha spiegato tutto il necessario illustrandoci la casa che era in perfette condizioni.
<br/>Addirittura la sua gentilezza si è spinta ad un invito a casa propria sul mare che non abbiamo soddisfatto solo per questioni di tempo..  colgo questa occasione per ringraziarla molto.
<br/>La posizione della casa è eccellente e permette di utilizzare la metro oppure di passeggiare a piedi in un bellissimo e vivace quartiere.

Also, it is located a step away from the metro, the Acropolis, the museum, plakka and great wine bars and exquisite little speciality shops with arty merchandise.  Although it would appear to be a noisy place the double glaze windows keep the noise out. We loved the place and atmosphere and considered changing our itinerary to remain longer. Finally the host was very understanding with us being two hours late from our original ETA.<br/>If anyone is considering staying in the centre don't think twice about where to book, this is The Place."

14132118,120989222,2016-12-13,89084380,Michelle,Our stay at Kwnstantinos place in Athens was excellent. His brother met us at the apartment and explained everything to us. The apartment was very clean and had everything that we needed. The bathroom was very good with an excellent shower with good water pressure. The WiFi was fast and easy to connect to. The best thing though about this apartment was its location. We only had 2 days to see Athens and we were able to walk to all the major sites including the Acropolis.

The beds had fairly hard mattresses like many other places in Greece. We were 4 people and we felt that it was a good fit for this apartment. There was, at the time of our visit, considerably noice from renovation on the floor above us. The apartment has a small kitchen with some kitchenware, but don't count on doing a lot of home cooking. We were welcomed by the mother of the host, Georgia, and she was very nice and friendly. The apartment was clean and the host always very fast and responsive. "

It is lovely and spacious, very clean, with good AC.  Kwnstantinos's mother met us and greeted us warmly - they even provided us with a gift of some food and wine in the refrigerator!  All communication was very easy.  The apartment is situated perfectly on a quiet street (if you look at the apartment on (Hidden by Airbnb) , do not be concerned that the building looks old - (Hidden by Airbnb) does not have up to date pictures, and don't be concerned that it is above a restaurant - we could hear no street noise at all) and an easy walk to the Acropolis and other sites.  We highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Athens."

You absolutely could not ask for a better location than this apartment. It's right by the Acropolis, metro station and fabulous restaurants but it's just one street over which makes the busyness disappear. The street is surprisingly quiet and the cafes & bars around have a wonderful ambience with occasional live music. <br/>The hosts are very friendly and accommodating. They even went out of their way to get us a blender for the kitchen. Great Air conditioning. Updated bathroom. The balcony is another bonus. Great breakfast spot......<br/>During our time we were able to try just about all the restaurants on the street and BY FAR you must go to Liondi! The perfect Greek food experience. "

A nice balcony to sit out in the evening to wind down from the day. AC in all bedrooms. Easy and clear check in and check out, and a very good price. Not everything is brand new, but it is in great shape and very clean! I hope on my next trip to Athens Konstantinos has an opening."
14132118,432359982709292840,2021-08-19,140386649,Christophe,Logement avec rapport qualité prix appréciable.  Au pied du quartier touristique de Plaka et de l'acropole et à 50m de la station de métro Acropolis.<br/>Quartier calme avec plusieurs bars et restaurants.<br/>Je conseille complètement !
14132118,454114241246313330,2021-09-18,55390772,Vicki,"I stayed for 3 weeks at Konstantinos's apartment, and I can honestly say it was one of the best-equipped Airbnbs I've ever stayed in! <br/><br/>I was working remotely from Athens, so wifi was important to me, as was having a comfortable place where I could feel at home to cook, etc. This apartment checked all the boxes!  The apartment could comfortably hold 4 adults for a long stay. The kitchen was well-stocked with pots, pans, silverware, etc. There is a washing machine to wash your clothes, a drying rack to dry them and a vacuum in case you need it. The AC worked well, and there are several wall units within the apartment. The bathroom has a large window in it, which is so nice for providing natural light! Also, there is a large terrace where you can sit and have your morning coffee or wine in the evening. <br/><br/>The area is PERFECT!! Right on the street are several cute wine bars/bars, where you can have an aperitivo. And then you are just behind the Acropolis Museum, the Acropolis, Plaka and so many options for eating and drinking! <br/><br/>Konstantinos always responded promptly to my questions - no problems at all with communication. <br/><br/>The apartment is on the first floor of a building with no elevator (about 20 steps up). Something to consider if you have mobility issues. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this apartment!! It was a wonderful stay!"

We enjoyed our stay. <br/><br/>One note is that we did find the beds a little challenging. The construction is different than what we (all 50+, from the states) are used to and found it a little difficult to sleep. I let the gracious host know. <br/><br/>Overall it was a nice, very well located flat."

14133870,115623562,2016-11-26,85759717,Jeff,"The apartment was exactly as the pictures reflected and John was waiting outside for us upon arrival.  This was helpful since we were unfamiliar with the AirBnB process.  But John was a great host and walked us up and explained how everything worked.  He even had maps and guides for restaurants and nearby attractions.  The booking process was seamless as well, he answered every question I had within an hour or two.
<br/>
<br/>Overall a great experience - this was my first time using AirBnB and it exceeded my expectations.  I spend around 60 days a year in hotels so we were a bit hesitant about whether the amenities would be similar.  But we shouldn't have worried, John provided everything (even a welcome bottle of wine).
<br/>
<br/>It's a great neighborhood, the Acropolis is only a 10 minute walk and there are lots of restaurants in the area.  We were also able to walk to Syntagma square in 25 minutes.  It's a quiet residential street so no noise issues or safety concerns but just two block over is a tram station and big taxi stand.

14133870,123679158,2016-12-30,10770457,Joshua,"We loved this apartment. It was clean, spacious, had all new appliances and furniture. We found the pictures in the listing were totally accurate.  Great location as well -- convenient to public transportation but totally walkable to the acropolis and syntagma square.  The neighbourhood was also very nice -- great coffee shop across the street, supermarket and convenience store also nearby.  The host was attentive and a pleasure to deal with.  We were a group of four and were happy to find that the sofa-bed sleeps great and that living space really does convert into a second bedroom (with its own balcony no less).  We will definitely return here if we visit Athens again.  "

14133870,143089122,2017-04-10,35915148,Jida,This is our first experience with Airbnb and it was spectacular. John was an amazing host available to us at all times day and night. He greeted us when we arrived and stayed in communications with us. <br/><br/>He stayed on the phone with my husband late at night when the wifi was not working. He paid for our cab because we didn't have Euros and of course we paid him back. <br/><br/>We were traveling with our 4 year old and the location was far for her to walk to the acropolis area but we had our stroller. At times it was difficult to navigate with a stroller with the crowds at the market and bumpy street. The apartment was amazing. The two rooms were great for us to watch tv while my daughter slept. Fully modern well laid out apartment. <br/><br/>We did have hot water but we didn't know if we turned on the water heater or not we we would rush through shower time but that is ok. <br/><br/>Great place at a great price and an awesome host who really took time out of his schedule to aid us when needed! <br/><br/>Look no further!
14133870,143690273,2017-04-13,74785346,Rodrigo,"Ioannis was a great holster. He contacted us in advance and waited for us in front of the building. He gave us precious information regarding the city and sites to visit. One night he even helped us to book a table at a fine restaurant with a view to Acrópole and arranged the taxi. The apartment is awesome in its location, decoration, appliances, and everything you need for a fine staying, including a few itens he left in the refrigerator. He also arranged our taxi to the airport. My family and I were really happy with our experience. Don't hesitate book now!!!"

14133870,157249264,2017-06-03,40169937,Peggy,"Ioannis was a very friendly and helpful host. He was there waiting for us when we arrived and offered help with transport and directions. The aprtm is new, very clean and well appointed: it has a nice kitchen with a large fridge with fruit, beer, water and wine and a nespressomachine, coffee and breakfast stuff and a dishwasher and even a washing machine in the wonderful bathroom. My daughter liked the smarttv's a lot. The area is safe and clean and a 15 minute walk to the Parthenon/Acropolis. The new Modern Art Museum is only one block away and you can see the Parthenon from the sunny balcony."

14133870,162218670,2017-06-20,25944847,Erik,"We could not have been more pleased with this apartment! It has recently been remodeled, with a modern, open-space concept. The description provided is accurate – no corners were cut in this renovation. My wife, son and I were comfortable in our bedrooms and slept soundly after city walks. The apartment is not on a busy street so we were not bothered by any street noise. The internet connection (wifi) was reliable and fast, the A/C kept us comfortable and the owner’s Netflix account came in handy when it rained one day. The location is within walking distance to the Parthenon, and Plaka. Uber or taxi can be used to go anywhere in Athens from the apartment. It was such a pleasurable stay, in a beautifully appointed, new apartment in historical Athens. Highly recommended to all travelers."
14133870,165448650,2017-07-01,28561521,Chandresh,"We really enjoyed our stay in this apartment. The apartment was very clean and had great facilities. It is located in a great area and it is near all the major tourist attractions in Athens. <br/>John is a great host, our flight was delayed by over 12 Hours and we arrived at 3:00 AM but John was there to greet us and help us get settled in. The fridge was stocked with beer and wine and there were plenty of snacks. He also arranged a taxi for us and the driver was excellent, he waited for us at the airport and was right on time to take us back. <br/>We strongly recommend this apartment. The only small issue was that the hot water heater took a long time to heat the water and ran out quickly. This is not a big issue, you just have to plan ahead. "

14133870,203938771,2017-10-16,29497950,Jennifer,"This place is one of our favorite places we have ever stayed - we really love the modern flat look.  Ionnis is a builder and renovated this place himself to very functional/beautiful/modern standards.  The apartment has ALL sorts of really nice touches like automatic/magnetic door stops, motion sensing night lights that are the perfect lighting level for seeing without waking the other sleeping people), back lighting in some really cool places; the rest of the design's beauty  is obvious from the pictures.   The place was also sparkling clean and very thoughtfully appointed, with tons of closet space, towels, washing machine powder, etc.  The kitchen had everything we wanted including a sharp knife,  greek coffee maker, something to make loose tea, and lots of pantry stocked items, like olive oil, herbs/spices, teas, coffee, including nescafe for making your frappe!  :)  Neighborhood was pretty good - there's a nice little green space directly across the street and a big grocery store just a few steps away.  Also, there's an AMAZING set of dessert places just a short walk away that we visited every night.  Certainly within walking distance of everything we wanted to do in Athens."

We really enjoyed our 3 nights there. It’s an easy walk into downtown Athens plus it’s close to the subway and tram. We highly recommend this lovely apartment!!!!

John gave us some food in case we needed it. He helped get our luggage inside and was flexible with the checkin and checkout times (within reason). He was just a delight, and the place was just what we needed at the end of a long trip. I would wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone staying in Athens."

He was extremely responsive and helpful in answering our questions and in accommodating our schedule. The place was just like the pictures, beautiful, immaculate, and super comfortable. Our family of 4 had more than enough room to unwind after fun filled days touring Athens. We were walking distance from all the best sites of Athens and appreciated the hints we got from Ioannis about places to visit and good restaurants to try. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you! "

I was travelling with my family (me, my wife and two one-year old babies), and the place - apart from being very cozy, clean and stylish - is well suited for family with kids. You can walk from his place to the Acropolis and it is right next to a major metro line that will take you to most tourist attractions in Athens. Me and my family had a great time in Athens and the accommodation (something that is not always easy when traveling with babies and toddlers) was a high point of our stay."

14133870,318628759,2018-09-04,7177436,Christian,"We have seen a lot of AirBnB apartments but only a few can compete with this one. The apartment can easily be split into three separate sleeping rooms with own brand new TVs etc. Netflix with account was onboard. Everything absolutely brand new and with a lot of taste. All you need is Johns place. Location is central but not directly in the main hotspot. Bathroom was stunning. We loved it!! And the best: John’s the most helpful, service-oriented host ever! We booked literally last second and needed to check in right away and he made it all work on a Sunday. His apartment is perfect especially if you bring kids/ children: you can watch TV and hang out while the baby is asleep in one of the other rooms as you can make the rooms perfectly dark. Thank you John for saving our time in Athens! Happy to come back!"

Loved the ability to close off a portion of the main room to create a second bedroom. <br/><br/>Well located. A supermarket just across the road, a great coffee shop even closer, and lots of great restaurants close by. Even a 24 hr kiosk just outside the main door for last minute essentials. <br/><br/>Really enjoyed being just outside of the craziness of the plaka district. Easy 15 minute walk to get to the Acropolis Museum and the plaka. <br/><br/>Host was amazing in his courtesy in meeting us upon arrival,communication before and during the stay, and providing useful tips on great restaurants etc."

He is the most warm and genuine host, provided us an amazing apartment in the middle of a vacation crisis, and even hand delivered the keys to us during my yoga class. Not to mention he was absolutely accessible and ready with solutions to every little question we had. <br/><br/>The place itself was modern, spotless, in a perfect location, and full of thoughtful little touches. I selfishly won’t say much more because I want the apartment available for our next stay! <br/><br/>Cheers to you John:)... We are looking forward to seeing you again later this year!"

I enjoyed my two-night stay at the fullest, everything was just perfect.<br/><br/>There were a lot of details I'd like to have in my apartment too.

14146634,100382603,2016-09-09,84792947,Mariana,"The apartment is perfect, very well decorated and renewed at the heart of Athens, with a perfect view in the balcony. From there, it was possible to do everything walking. <br/>Athanasios is very good hostel. Gave us some tips and also helped us storing our luggage while we enjoyed the last day before going to the airport."
14146634,100815953,2016-09-11,86886138,Ivy,"Tanasi was very communicative before our arrival to Athens making sure to have his driver pick us up upon arrival. Even though our plane was delayed, the driver was still there and was very nice. We arrived around 10pm to his apartment and Tanasi greeted us and showed us around. His apartment looks exactly like the photos- it is so beautiful! It is a very big space, extremely clean with a breathtaking view of the Temple of Zeus. The bathroom was spacious with a great shower- better than the hotel we were staying at previously! The bed was SO comfortable. Tanasi also made sure that there was food in the apartment- orange juice, eggs, toast, etc. That was a very nice touch. Around 6am we were woken up by very loud banging- there was construction going on outside. We were not able to get back to sleep, but when I told Tanasi about the problem, he contacted the workers immediately and tried to make them stop. For our difficulty with the workers, he also offered a free ride to the airport, which was much appreciated. All in all, Tanasi did everything he could to make sure we had an enjoyable and comfortable stay at his apartment. I would recommend to anyone looking in Athens!"
14146634,100951573,2016-09-11,68620671,Louise,"Athanasios communicated very efficiently as soon as the booking was made, even arranging transportation. He then met us at the apartment, and provided a map with great restaurant and other tips. Apartment was very spacious and clean, and you cannot beat the location! Will definitely stay here if in Athens again."
14146634,101834624,2016-09-15,45784601,Sadaf,"Tanasi was very kind and accommodating. He already planned a route for us to walk the following day. The apartment was spacious with a fantastic view of the Temple of Zeus, especially at night. "
14146634,103085897,2016-09-20,45874273,Anu,"Athanasios was a fantastic host. 
<br/>Very quick to reply to any queries and made us feel at home when we arrived. 
<br/>The place was amazing and worked perfectly for us 7 sailing ladies. 
<br/>He even provided us breakfast supplies!
<br/>Location was perfect and he gave us a tip about local restaurant nearby and we had a best meal in Greece!
<br/>We had a wonderful stay !"
14146634,103732363,2016-09-24,62579408,Katrina,"We were in Athens for a few days with our 2 children and the apartment was in a perfect location - within walking distance of all the main tourist sites, and had great views of the Temple of Zeus and the Acropolis - just as shown in the photos! 
<br/>
<br/>Thanasi was a great host. Arranged for a driver to pick up and drop us off at the airport and the apartment was fully equipped with everything we needed for a few days stay, including detergent for the washing mashine and the kitchen/fridge stocked with the basics - milk, bread, yogurt, eggs, fruit etc.. 
<br/>
<br/>Although there was a clothes line to hang clothes off the balcony at the back, a clothes horse would have been useful to hang clothes indoors as it rained on one of the days we were there and couldn't hang out the washing! 
<br/>
<br/>Overall, our experience was great and would definitely return on our next trip to Athens! "
14146634,104367732,2016-09-26,11647084,Maria,"We were very well received. Athanasios gave us directions to visit the town, to have some good meals and also to plan the rest of our trip. The apartment is large, modern, perfectly clean and you see Zeus temple from the window. <br/>We would come again for the location and comfort of this place!"
14146634,105446848,2016-10-01,80373159,Eileen,"The best part of the apartment is the view. We did takeout dinner and ate at the balcony to enjoy the view. Totally recommend it for couples. The host was nice and left us some breakfast items, snacks and beverages in the fridge for us. You can hear some traffic noise but the neighborhood is quieter than the ones near Syntagma Square. Bed was comfortable and the place is clean. The only glitch was we couldn't exit the building without a key in the early morning when we were in a hurry to leave. Otherwise the host is gracious and helpful. "
14146634,108182965,2016-10-15,70362722,Luzius,"From the beginning communication with Tanasi was extremely easy.
<br/>We just stayed over night to catch a flight early next morning.  A. was not aware of our tight time schedule and had the fridge stuffed with Greek goodies.
<br/>Tanasis recommendations were tailor made to the time available to us so we were able to make full use of our evening in the aura of the Acropolis.
<br/>It was wonderful to spend time in his spotlessly clean and roomy apartement. The view is really spectacular.
<br/>In retrospective we are sad to not calculate at least a full day to spend here in this awesome surroundings."
14146634,108751515,2016-10-17,89880917,Matt,The apartment was in close proximity to main attractions and tourist sites. The description and pictures were accurate. 
14146634,109335085,2016-10-21,89078370,Heather,We stayed for four days and the location was perfect to see the ancient centre of Athens. The beds were comfortable and the apartment well furnished. Athanasios made us welcome and the fridge contained all we needed for our first breakfast so we could get out exploring and not bother with grocery shopping!
14146634,109519843,2016-10-22,94323921,Akta,"Very centrally located overlooking the Temple of Zeus and walking distance away from Acropolis, Tanasi's apartment is perfect for someone who wants to explore Athens on foot. It is luxurious and Tanasi's attention to detail made our stay even more comfortable. He was excellent with directions, stocked the kitchen well even though we stayed only for a night. His communication was prompt and efficient. Highly recommend this place and the host!"
14146634,110386947,2016-10-25,41750015,Thomas,"Tanasi was an amazing host. The night we arrived he sat down with us and drew out a plan for touring the city. The location couldn't be more perfect. Easy walking to all of the major sights. Easy access to the metro as well. The apartment was spectacular. Clean, comfortable, incredibly spacious, and the views from the patio were amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone traveling to Athens."
14146634,111461875,2016-10-31,59933019,Heather,"A beautiful, comfortable apartment in a perfect location for visitors to Athens. The host picked us up from the airport and provided some basic breakfast food as well as a local rundown of the area. We highly recommend it!"
14146634,111647501,2016-11-01,7828426,Xanthos,We had a great stay at this perfect apartment. The only issue was that our stay was too short!! Great experience... Highly recommended...!  
14146634,112283807,2016-11-05,4955579,Suzanne,"Perfect location to visit Athens. You can visit the Acropolis and other sightseeing spots on foot. Spectacular view of Temple of Zeus from the balcony. The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures. It is clean and spacious. The fridge is stocked with milk, juice, eggs and yogurt. Bread, coffee and tea also was provided which helps to get the morning started.<br/><br/>Athanasios is a great host, he met us on our arrival and provided tips on touring Athens. He also arrange taxi for our early morning departure to the airport.  We accidentally broke the glass coffee pot and he was kind enough to let us pay for it without getting upset with us.  Thank you Athanasios!<br/><br/>Highly recommend Athanasios 's apartment for anyone want great experience visiting Athens.<br/><br/><br/>"
14146634,112950419,2016-11-09,74526284,Nabeel,"Tanasi was a great host. He was responsive to emails, easy to arrange arrival and departure with, and provided great recommendations to check out in Athens. The apartment itself was beautiful, with an incredible view of the Temple of Zeus, and a very short walk to the Acropolis and Plaka, the old city. 
<br/>
<br/>I stayed with a group of five, and it should be noted that two of the beds in the four bed count are the blue couches that are showed in the pictures of the listing, with the backs of the couches removed. While perfectly comfortable, this means that there is slightly less living space than expected from the pictures, as the living room becomes a quasi bedroom."
14146634,114026989,2016-11-15,5120766,Roland,"My father and I had a wonderful stay at the apartment. Athanasios was the perfect host; from providing us with the keys and lots of information on things to do in the city upon our arrival to storing our suitcases for the last day while we were in town. The apartment is perfectly located, clean and has everything you need. "
14146634,114387703,2016-11-18,2692991,Paulinho,"Apartamento incrível, muito tranquilo e espaçoso. Ideal para conhecer o centro histórico. Athanasios é o melhor anfitrião possível e eu recomendo muito o lugar."
14146634,114974373,2016-11-21,20315804,Kris,"Tanasi was a wonderful host who was in constant communication and made our stay wonderful. He offered us comforts for our stay, like eggs and other accoutrement to make breakfast. The location was perfect for a couple days of sight-seeing and going out on the town. I would highly recommend if you love to walk around and see everything in town. "
14146634,115479256,2016-11-25,19473354,Sashi,"Fantastic host, very warm and welcoming. Really looks out for his guests. Apartment is simply fantastic with amazing views and a terrific location in proximity to all the major historic sites. "
14146634,116271063,2016-11-28,2906849,Anna,"The apartment itself is absolutely great. It is not even big - it's huge, and the view from the common room is probably one of the best in Athens. The apartment was clean and well eqiped. It is within walking distance (about 10-15 minutes) from more or less all the attractions of Athens. Tenasi was in good and constant contact with us - even though we came quite late as the plane was late, there was no problem. It wasn't also a problem to leave our luggage in the apartment after check in. The area is rather ""vibrant"" (be aware that all the windows from the coomon room go out on rather ""busy"" street with lots of cars, but is isn't a problem, as the bedrooms are on the other side of apartment and there is the air condition in every room), but very safe. This apartment is a very good choice to discover Athens. "
14146634,120049185,2016-12-07,3647235,Raya,"We got into Athens very late with two very young children which made Athanasios offer to send us a driver to pick us up a wonderful option as the price was the same as of the local taxis from the airport.  
<br/>The apartment has amazing view and is very spacious, which is great for those traveling with kids and we got to enjoy the cool interior design. The apartment is a 10 min walk to the Achropolis museum and 2 min from the tram station.
<br/>Athanasios was in the apartment to greet us and give a general description of the area and even filled the fridge with stuff for breakfast. He was also flexible with our late departure so we really couldn't ask for more."

Great place for relaxing and exploring historical Athens."

Walking distance to every single landmark in Athens... close to shops and restaurants... plenty of everything around! The view is breathtaking! I will come back some time and will recommend to all my friends in Australia! Athanasios is very kind and helpful! Is a pleasure to find hosts like him! 
14146634,123884301,2016-12-31,3159320,Kunjan,"This is one of the BEST airbnb experiences we have had. I have always maintained that Airbnb can exceed hotel experiences and Athanasios proved it.
<br/>
<br/>1. Great Location
<br/>- Center to everything. It is smack in the middle of the city with walking distance to Acra, museums, stadium. You can even see the Zeus temple from the apartment.
<br/>
<br/>2. Great Communication
<br/>- Athanasios gave us his (Hidden by Airbnb) and was always very reachable. He was always there to help us.
<br/>
<br/>3. Great Tips
<br/>- We got great tips around places to see and taxi services. He arranged for a great taxi service.
<br/>
<br/>4. Well Stocked Pantry/Fridge
<br/>- We could make our own breakfast with the eggs, yogurt, milk, juice and the kitchen utensils. This was great!!
<br/>
<br/>In addition what made Athanasios great was that he accommodated our request to store luggage, accommodated our checkin and checkout time and was very very hospitable.
<br/>
<br/>Thank you so much."

He was responsive at all time Ana took really good care of us. The location is great and is within walking distance to everything we wanted to see. Great restraurants and shops just a few steps away.  If ever back in Athens, we would stay here again. <br/>"
14146634,125158592,2017-01-04,71180138,Kalliopi,"Athanasios was a very helpful, knowledgeable host who knew everything we needed about the area. The apartment is gorgeous with fantastic views and air conditioning in all the rooms. Would recommend to anyone!"

14146634,125908111,2017-01-08,29140175,Anastasia,"Ο Αθανάσιος αποτελεί την επιτομή του απόλυτου οικοδεσπότη! 
<br/>Ευγενής εκ φύσεως ,με αυθεντικά ειλικρινή πρόθεση να κατανοήσει τις ανάγκες σου  και να βοηθήσει ,βρίσκεται πάντα τόσο κοντά σου όσο χρειάζεται, χωρίς να γίνεται φορτικός.
<br/>Καταρχάς, βρήκαμε το διαμέρισμα σε άριστη κατάσταση. Οι φωτογραφίες ,τολμώ να πω ότι το αδικούν.  Τα κλινοσκεπάσματα, μοσχομύριζαν καθαριότητα, όπως και όλο το σπίτι.
<br/>Η θέα απίστευτη! Ναός Διός, Παρθενώνας ,Λυκαβηττός. .. παραμυθένια.
<br/>Η εγγύτητα επίσης του κέντρου ήταν εξαιρετικά σημαντική. Βρισκόμασταν σε 2 με  10 λεπτά όπου θέλαμε. Στάση μετρό υπάρχει στα 200 περίπου μέτρα.
<br/>Να σημειώσω ότι ο Αθανάσιος μας επέτρεψε να μείνουμε μέχρι τις πέντε το απόγευμα, χωρίς να χρεώσει κάτι επιπλέον ,γεγονός που μας διευκόλυνε πάρα πολύ,μιας και το τραίνο μας έφευγε στις έξι. 
<br/>Συστήνουμε ανεπιφύλακτα τη διαμονή στο διαμέρισμα. Είναι εμπειρία!  Θα χαρούμε να το επαναλάβουμε! "

I staied there with my family, we are a group of 5 adults,  the spaces are perfect, and Athanasios provided a lot of things for breakfast (coffee,tea, marmelade, eggs, butter, juice): He's a perfect host and very helpful. I would recommend him and this apartment! "
14146634,128216065,2017-01-23,96460456,Jessica,"We totally recommend the apartment, it's a magic place. It's spacious, the decoration is simple but classy, and you can find everything you need to feel like home. The location is perfect, you can go walking to the main touristic points but also to restaurants, cafes, and nightlife areas. But with no doubts, we highlight the views... they're even better in reality than the pictures. You can see the Temple of Zeus from the balcony while you enjoy your breakfast or see the sunset with a glass of wine... It was difficult for us to leave the place sometimes! My friend and I totally agree that thanks to this apartment our experience in Athens has been even better. Efjaristó, Athanasios! "

14146634,130906374,2017-02-09,18008611,Jackie,Absolutely GORGEOUS apartment! Upscale decor with an incredible view of the Temple of Zeus. Wonderful location within walking distance of all attractions. Athanasios is a great host; he was very helpful when planning our stay and was able to accommodate our early check-in. My husband and I felt so fancy staying here. Highly recommend!!!
14146634,132284222,2017-02-17,108993733,M,"My first Airbnb and first ever accommodation review so I thought I should include what I would want to know before booking.<br/><br/>The apartment was in a perfect location, just minutes from the Acropolis metro station, and the Acropolis Museum. Other main attractions weren't far away, either. The view was excellent, and could cause arguments on who got what sofa because of it! The apartment is clean, welcoming and nicely decorated. There are a couple of minor maintenance jobs to be done, but they don't detract from the stay. <br/><br/>The host, Athanasios, was responsive to problems (some had nothing to do with him or apartment!) and questions. He provided a good orientation  to the area and gave advice on where to visit. He was also very helpful with bag storage on the last day. In the end we were able to leave the bags in the apartment, but Athanasios had a plan b.<br/><br/>Makings for breakfast were provided - milk, bread, butter, eggs, juice, yogurt, coffee and tea. You wouldn't want to be doing any real cooking in the apartment, but it's perfectly adequate for breakfast and light snack preparation. Glasses, plates, mugs and cutlery provided. A frying pan and a large saucepan were available, too. Both bedrooms were a good size, with large and very comfortable beds, and lots of cupboard space.  <br/><br/>The front of the property is on a busy road, but the bedrooms being at the back were quiet. A couple of little shops are around the corner for purchase of food and drinks. <br/><br/>Overall it's a great apartment and great value for money. And would definitely recommend it."

We felt extremely comfortable in the home and the view is as advertised. Athanasio was communicative and quick in all of his responses. We had a little bit of trouble with the circuit breaker during our visit, but Athanasio sent someone out and it was fixed within 30 minutes. We would highly recommend!"

14146634,141687201,2017-04-04,44923459,Ed,"My group of 4 stayed here in early April and I can't recommend it enough. Athanasios was extremely responsive prior to our visit, and the entire time we were there. He and his colleague took the time to explain the area and make recommendations which were all spot on. It was so helpful to have a kitchen stocked for breakfast, and this location couldn't be more convenient for exploring Athens. And the pictures don't do it justice. Everything met/exceeded our expectations and to have the Temple of Zeus right outside our window, and the Acropolis in full view, especially in the evening was the best. This was the perfect combination of a great host, a great space and a great location. "

Felt very safe walking to and from the apartment. Athanasios' nephew met us and gave a perfect orientation to food and must see sites as well as follow-on transportation to our next destination. Appreciated the driver from the airport Athanasios coordinated for us and his quick response to inquiries. Could not have asked for more!

We see and know great Athens by walk in 4 days easily, only go to the beach by train which the station nearby the apartment. And the Temple of Zeus is outside of the windows, it is really amazing.<br/><br/>The apartment is really comfortable and luxury, everything is good to use and live.

The location was the best, with views of the Acropolis to your left and the Temple of Zeus right in front of you!  It simply could not have been better.

I was worried that the apartment was far from the Acropolis, where we planned to spend the majority of our time, but I was very pleased that everything was less than a five minute walk from his apartment. We had a beautiful view of Zeus's Temple and we will definitely be staying here again our next time in Athens."

The air-con was very efficient in both bedrooms and the living room and was an essential feature for us at the time we were in Athens. Facilities in the kitchen are a little limited but with so many eateries so nearby, there is little need to do much cooking. Highly recommended."

Thanasis was an excellent host, sending a driver to pick us up from the airport, greeting us at the apartment, helping us to become familiar with the city and providing recommendations for sights and restaurants. If you are looking for a place to stay in Athens, you really should look no further. Having the Temple of Zeus right outside the window of the large living area, a view of the Acropolis from the balcony and all the major sights just a walk away made this the perfect place to stay in Athens. <br/>"
14146634,179209512,2017-08-07,113584306,Elena,We stayed in Athanasios apparent just one night. It was a great beginning of our vacation in Greece. Everything you need is there. Breathtaking views of the Temple of Zeus. Athanasios was very pleasant and accommodating. Thanks a lot.

From the moment we walked in, we were in love.  This was a tough place to say ""goodbye"" to, but we cannot wait to come back to Athens.  The ad is 100% accurate.  Close to metro, supermarkets, and the best views from the ancient monuments of Athens.  I can see why this place sells out so quickly.  "

Any question I had he answered immediately.  He arranged for our airport pickup and to be brought back to the airport.  The driver contacted him as soon as we were in his car and Athanasios received us, showed us the apartment and left us with a warm and welcomed feeling.  The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photographs: Spacious, beautifully and artfully decorated, extremely comfortable and incredibly well-situated.  He had some food and juice and water for us in the refrigerator, and coffee and tea in the cabinets.  We couldn't have asked for more.  My only regret is that we didn't stay longer.  I hope to return soon!"

Good restaurants, grocery stores, shops, nightlife and of course the Acropolis, all within 15-20 walk. Athanasio was very helpful and it was nice to have breakfast food and coffee there for me.

Very easy to get to, tour buses and taxis leave from the same street.  You are up above the traffic and noise.  The space is quiet and we found it very easy to sleep.  Not on the Plaka but very near!  Not at the acropolis but very near!  Small grocery shop on same block made it like being home.  On a very well lit street."

He is a font of knowledge which we followed closely and gained a lot from as it meant we were able to explore the great city that is Athens from our arrival at what is an exceptionally well located apartment. Being able to look out at some of the worlds greatest archaeology with such good connections public transport wise was a real bonus.  The city very much lived up to our expectations and it is fair to say that Tanasi contributed much to that.

Excellent soundproofing, once the double glazed balcony doors are shut you wouldn't know you are above a busy road.<br/>Very comfy beds, airconditioners in both bedrooms and living area. Basic groceries supplied, which was wonderful.<br/>There is a lift that is hilariously tiny. But better than no lift! The shower requires a bit of manoeuvring to get into if you are not slim and bendy. Once you are in there you have room enough, however."
14146634,319651627,2018-09-07,24237253,Nelly,Our host was very sweet and accommodating. I definitely recommend staying here when in Athens. I always received very fast responses when I messaged the host. Exceeded my expectations!
14146634,320539257,2018-09-09,133930100,Terry,"The apartment was in a good location-a 5 minutes walk to Plaka and many restaurants. The bathrooms were small and directly adjacent to one another. Neither was attached to a bedroom- they were just outside the bedrooms- so there was little to no privacy. Also, there was only one shower so it made it difficult for four people to get ready in the morning. The host was great and helpful."

Supplies in fridge and pantry unexpected. Facilities exceeded expectations and there is a lift to transport luggage and weary travellers. <br/>It was within walking distance of all the major tourist attractions and even the city centre. Plaka market minutes away and hundreds of options for dining within minutes. <br/>Our host gave us a traditional family restaurant recommendation close to apartment and it was delicious and very cheap. <br/>Highly recommend.
14146634,326453671,2018-09-22,155844885,Curtis,"Location, location, location! Fantastic view of Zeus Temple while you sit and eat breakfast.  And if you are on the veranda you can look up the slope to a side view of Parthenon. It’s  lit up at night and looks heavenly. A quick elevator takes you up to the 4th floor (actually 5 th floor) so 1 floor  shy of the rooftop penthouse above you, offering a very special outlook across Athens. Tremendous value."

Beds were comfortable,  kitchen was ok probably best if you don’t plan to cook much. The host is very attentive and helpful."
14146634,331632869,2018-10-03,25769621,Mayra,"This apartment was in a great location with incredible view. The online pictures do not do it justice . Athanasio was really a super host . Check in was seemless , he arranged for our pick up at the airport , he was there when we arrived and spent a lot of time explaining the area and prividing tips . He left water and breakfast items In the fridge for us which was a very nice touch . We highly recommend this place and most of all Athanasios went above and beyond to make our experience incredible."

14146634,341517886,2018-10-27,46289410,Barbara,"Athanasio was right there to help us and even helped when the wind was banging something above us.  Great location, calming view,  large space (must be unique for a city like Athens).  Kitchen is functional.  We weren't cooking though, we were so close to many great places to eat-even Indian and Thai food!  Bedrooms in the back (where there's also windows and a small balconey were quiet and can be made dark at night with the shutters.  Never needed heat or air conditioning so can't comment ...  Used the washing machine though and that was useful.  Overall a nice big space that makes for a comfortable base for exploring the city!"

The view is just as incredible as it looks in the pictures. We miss this place already and we just left this morning."
14146634,354646415,2018-12-02,1575453,Marcela,This apartment is in an excellent location in Athens. Everything is within walking distance. Athanasios himself is a perfect host and offered a lot of excellent suggestions as it was our first time in Athens. We loved the balcony views - they were picturesque! Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic local experience.
14146634,358986708,2018-12-16,63342722,Panos,"Well what can someone say about Athanasios house? The photos speak truly and say in simple words:  ""Τhe view is GLORIOUS"" . As a fact by itself was enough for checking in.  Plus it is ideally located! Staying there we have acquired one more VERY important reason. Athanasios is a grand, most helpful and really polite host . Athanasios thanks for everything"
14146634,361306706,2018-12-23,196860858,Ivan,"Квартира очень просторная.

14146634,369329664,2019-01-10,11223866,Philippe,"This appartement is a best in town, the view is astonishing and the location is perfect. Everything is reached by short walk without being in the crowded plaka. The appartement is big and luminous. The bathroom is clean, hot water and there is two toilettes which is appreciable. Athanasios is really kind and welcoming, he did all the best to please pour stay. <br/>Try the falafel restaurant just next door, it’s a really nice restaurant, the best falafel I ever eaten( really) and overall the owner make their food with love( not only falafel) , and this you can really feel, everything is delicious !!!"
14146634,402643561,2019-01-19,213515918,Katerina,"It was the best location in the whole city, perfectly nice apartment with many towels and very comfortable beds. We recommend it to anybody who would like to go and visit Athens. thank you."
14146634,406073156,2019-01-28,21166980,Dimitris,"A great apartment with fantastic views and located very near the acropolis museum, Plaka and the historic centre. Excellent access via public transport (and the acropolis metro stop is 5 mins walk) and lots of nice restaurants and cafes (including a brilliant vegan street food cafe next door!) and supermarket nearby. And Thanasis is an excellent host and made us feel very welcome. Thank you!"
14146634,407812732,2019-02-03,239629772,Dennis,"The view is exactly like the pictures. Great balcony. Big bedrooms, also with balcony but no view. Nice and bright. Nice Vegan place downstairs (and I'm not a vegan and i found lots to like, plus great coffee). Grocery store a few doors down. Museum, restaurants, and subway a couple of blocks away. Easy walking distance from many of Athen's good spots."
14146634,411083047,2019-02-11,124681580,Marios,If you planning to visit Athens Athanasios place is one of the best in city?<br/>Everything are in walking distance
14146634,414274264,2019-02-19,5561360,Jennifer,"Great space and GREAT view.  Very easy to walk to all main sights. The beds are very comfortable as well.  Athanasios was very quick to respond and easy to communicate with.  Having a washer in the apt was a bonus.  The only negative was that we were there during February so it was cold, and the heating unit in the main living room was not enough to warm the large space.  There is wifi but it is slow.  I would still recommend this apt to anyone heading to Athens."
14146634,415699939,2019-02-23,225178935,Zhanna,"Athanasios is a wonderful hospitable host. The apartment is in the best place - all major sights can be easily reached on foot. Photos are fully consistent with reality. When visiting Athens, I will definitely try to stay in the apartments of Athanasios."
14146634,421756256,2019-03-10,7161321,Olga,"Wonderful hospitality, location can’t be any better! Athanasio also gave up some local’s tips on good place to eat (without tourists).<br/>View is INCREDIBLE from the flat!<br/>The only thing we couldn’t make work well was air con (to warm up one of the two bedrooms). Otherwise, lovely time, would recommend and come again myself!"

14146634,425882605,2019-03-19,166953775,Anam,"This apartment is in such a perfect location with really good views of the Acropolis and temple of Zeus.  Athanasio was such a great host and he even provided us with tea, coffee, bread and Greek yogurt which was a very nice touch. The apartment is great value because of its location. It’s in the centre and close to everything. There are loads of restaurants and cafes nearby and it’s centre to all the main sites in Athens. The apartment is very clean and the building is very safe as well. This is a place that I would definitely recommend for a trip to Athens because of its location, cleanliness and a host that is very good and responds in a very timely manner to any queries."
14146634,431595167,2019-04-01,55045195,Christiann,"I don't have enough good things to say about this place. First of all, the view is incredible - literally right across the street from the Temple of Olympian Zeus. In addition, the location cannot be beat - you are right in the center of Athens and about a block away from the Plaka. There is also a small market nearby if you need any groceries. The actual space is great - 2 nice size bedrooms, comfortable beds & pillows, lots of fresh towels, and a washer, and eggs, toast, juice, yogurt in fridge for breakfast. Lastly, our host was wonderful - he returned all messages within 15 minutes. Lastly, the price cannot be beat. I highly recommend staying here!"
14146634,434578503,2019-04-08,85874461,Aye,"Athanasios’s beautiful apartment is located just a few min walk from the plaka and the Acropolis. The apartment’s balcony looks out to the stunning view of the temple of Zeus. The night time view of the temple is breathtaking as well! Most of the major attractions in Athens - the Acropolis, the temple of Zeus, the Panathenaic Stadium were all walking distance away! We had a great experience in Athens and Athanasios’s apartment contributed greatly to it!"

Notre hôte a été très réactif et prévenant, un taxi nous attendais à l’aéroport et un autre pour le ferry. Des petites choses étaient dans le frigo à notre arrivée. L’appartement est grand et propre, les lits parfait. Un grand merci à vous. Je le conseille sans hésitation."

14146634,445833541,2019-04-30,23921140,Sue,"Athanasios’ apartment is amazing and it is easy to get most of the scenic spot in Athens. From the balcony a fantastic view of Zeus relics and Acropolis can be seen as well. We check in late during the night and the landlord was waiting for us then, and help to receive our delayed luggage as we are out the other day. There is full equipped kitchen cookware and landlord prepared some breakfast food supplies for us! Great great thanks to Athanasios! A second time choice definitely!"
14146634,446768137,2019-05-02,41870702,Barry,Best location in Athens.  Priceless balcony view.

The apartment is perfectly located within easy walking distance to Plaka and the historical sites. It definitely is as described with views as amazing as the photos.

14146634,451189959,2019-05-11,3343772,Malte,"Absolutely stunning place - both in location and interieur. Being this close to the center will mean you‘ll be living by a busy street, but that‘s just Athens in this. Athanios’ apartment is amongst the best appointed and tastefully arranged that I have seen in a long time. Added to that, our host was incredibly helpful and forthcoming. All in all, a delightful stay that we would be happy to repeat any time."
14146634,451860059,2019-05-12,1566381,Jess,This space is perfectly located in the heart of the most vibrant part of town. We arrived early and the host arranged for us to relax in one of his other properties as we were traveling with an exhausted 11 month old. He also arranged a taxi to meet us at the airport and return us the following day. The space is gorgeous with outstanding views. You can walk easily to all the main tourist attractions and amazing restaurants. I highly recommend staying here!!
14146634,452829866,2019-05-14,149811282,Anne,"This accommodation is very well positioned near the Acropolis and Plaka - which is vibey and fun.

14146634,460357351,2019-05-29,26110827,Hazel,"Fantastic views, great location, wonderful host. Tanasi’s place has two bedrooms with queen beds but I loved the view from the living room so much, I slept on the couch, looking at the lights of the Temple of Zeus. It is a short walk to the shops and restaurants of Plaka and the entrance to the Acropolis Museum. Tanasi arranged for our pier and airport transfers for which we were grateful. I would highly recommend this place and would stay here again in a heartbeat."
14146634,461264746,2019-05-31,162480997,Deirdre,"This place is the perfect spot in Athens! So close to the Plaka region and the acropolis. Close to the metro should you wish to get around the city. Athanasios very kindly arranged for transfers from the port then to the airport. With a fantastic balcony overlooking the temple of Zeus and with a great view of the acropolis, it’s the perfect spot to unwind with a coffee or wine. There is a lift which is great if you have luggage. Highly recommended!"
14146634,465618182,2019-06-08,172258799,Susan,"Athanasios’s place was even better than expected. The accommodations were comfortable and clean, and the view is incredible!! He is a friendly, hospitable host who is quickly responsive to questions and needs.  This is an excellent place to stay in Athens - close to all major sites and you won’t believe the view you’ll have every morning and evening. Highly recommended!!"

14146634,467844414,2019-06-11,192886802,Elena,Tanasi es un gran host. Ha sido una gran experiencia en una localización inmejorable pues todo estaba a unos minutos andando. El apartamento está muy bien y con todo lo que necesitábamos.
14146634,468668377,2019-06-13,4011849,Jamie,"Great location and spectacular view! The host met us at the apartment and was very helpful with arranging a taxi for us when we arrived and when we departed. The taxi driver was also very friendly and helpful! The space was incredible, lots of room and very clean. The host provided light breakfast food that was really a nice touch. The vegan cafe downstairs was great to have nearby, and there is a mini market just down the block that was very convenient. Highly recommend staying here!"
14146634,472157530,2019-06-19,71511935,Katherine,Really lovely apartment with fantastic views. The location was brilliant. Would definitely stay here again :)
14146634,473099386,2019-06-21,43287613,Jessica,"The pictures do not do this view justice! We stayed at Athanasios’s place for the last few days of our trip on Greece and it was so lovely to relax with that view outside of our window. The location is amazing, only a few minutes walk to restaurants, bars, and the Acropoli."

The location was perfect, just 2 min. walk from Akropolis metro station and very close to the city center on foot. The apartment was perfect for our needs and the information provided was accurate. We really appreciated the flexibility with out late check-in. The communication with Athanasios was very easy and smooth and he replied very quickly, always providing answers to our questions. He went the extra mile by helping us arrange transportation a couple of times. I strongly recommend this place to families and groups of friends who want to enjoy the local experience in Athens."
14146634,483161370,2019-07-07,12669905,Steven,The pictures don’t do Athanasios’ place justice. The apartment is amazing (it’s huge) and the location can’t be beat. We checked in extremely late due to a cancelled flight and Athanasios and his colleague Eli were beyond helpful.
14146634,484547032,2019-07-09,72550691,Kevin And Stephanie,"We spent one day in Athens before taking a ferry to an island and this was the perfect place. Only a few blocks from the Acropolis and a great view of the Temple of Zeus. Athanasius was an amazing host...even arranged pick-up from the airport and drop-off at the port. He also provided some drinks, breakfast food, and helpful hints. Definitely recommend and will hopefully stay there again."

14146634,488527114,2019-07-15,49630595,Heike,Alles prima. Toller Blick auf den Zeuztempel. Super netter Vermieter . Sogar  zum Frühstück wurde von ihm eingekauft. Strasse davor ist leider viel befahren und bei offenen Fenster  etwas laut. Dafür steht zentral gelegen
14146634,490126475,2019-07-18,9700234,Fotina,"Amazing to get offered a pick up and drop Off service. Makes arriving a much better experience. Centrally located, nice views and all amenities provided"

14146634,495469572,2019-07-26,166738989,Bob,"We had a great stay here. Nice and clean, very spacious, and our hosts were generous with food in the fridge for breakfast.<br/><br/>When I first saw the photos of the view, I wondered if there was any Photoshopping, but they are the real deal! The Temple of Olympic Zeus is indeed right across the street, and you can also see part of the Acropolis when you are on the balcony. <br/><br/>it is located on a busy street, but soundproofing is great, and you'd never know from the bedrooms which are away from the street. There are a few restaurants and a mini-market around the corner, and lots more choices just minutes away. (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps will show you the Acropolis is a (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minute walk, which is true, but that's to the main entrance right near the top. You'll actually find yourself at the museum and the ""side entrance"", which is the quieter one, within about 5 minutes. The Metro stop is right there as well. The Plaka (lots of shops and food) is just 5-10 minutes away, as is the entrance to the Temple of Olympic Zeus (it's on the other side of the site, so it's not quite as quick to get to as you might think with it being across the street). <br/><br/>Would happily stay here again."
14146634,496089404,2019-07-27,36997575,Beth,"This apartment is spacious, in a great location, and has great views of the temple of Zeus. Eli coordinated our arrival and departure and was very helpful, even arranging taxis for us both ways. We were only there one night, but it's great place to stay and see all the major tourist sights in Athens."
14146634,501053102,2019-08-03,57972637,Matt,Beautiful apartment that has stunning views out across the Temple of Zues. Very comfortable and the host was very friendly!

We found in the fridge all we needed for our breakfast, water,coffee, tea, bread for toasts,juice,youghurt. Mr Athanasios is of course a classy person, so kind , in a word the perfect Host !  This would be our choice if back in Athens :)"
14146634,505476300,2019-08-09,263525753,Anna,"Athanasio’s apartment is stylish and spacious, centrally located with probably the best views in Athens. Staying there made our trip a great holiday.  It was spotlessly clean, and the small extra touches were appreciated. We got fantastic advice on restaurants and other amenities which also added to our visit. Thank you so much."

U can reach easily any place you want. <br/>By the way, there is a great vegan falafel downstairs....<br/>Will be glad to return someday..."
14146634,514869668,2019-08-22,18432221,Rachael,"We needed a spot to stay overnight while we were traveling between countries, and Athanasios’s place did not disappoint!! Just a few minutes walk from the acropolis and a lovely area of shops and restaurants. Looking out at the Temple of Zeus off the balcony is such a treat, as well. The apartment was spacious, beautiful, clean, and more. I really wish we could’ve spent more time here!"
14146634,516970212,2019-08-25,8848445,Cecilia,"The location is fantastic. It’s only a short walk to restaurants and shopping. It’s conveniently located at the base of the Acropolis which makes it very easy to meet up with our tour guide and to the hop-on-hop-off buses. The apartment itself is spacious for the 3 of us, all adults, to spread out and very quiet. Photos are very accurate and the apartment was super clean. The view from the two balconies were amazing. A special shout out to our host and Eli, the handsome young co-host! Our flight was delayed leaving LAX which forced us to take a later connector. Upon arrival we found out that one of our luggage was missing and by the time we arrived at the apartment it was almost 4am. I had informed our host, Athanasios, of the delayed from LAX. Athanasios kept in touch with me the whole time, and at the end not only did he send young Eli to wait up for us but he didn’t charge us anything for the inconvenience. On top of that, the fridge had bread, eggs, orange juice, and Greek yogurt waiting for us so we didn’t have to worry about breakfast the next day. All in all, we couldn’t have asked for better hosts who went above and beyond for us. Thank you so very much Athanasios and Eli!!!"
14146634,518669062,2019-08-27,147317532,Songyi,"The apartment is in walking distance to the Acropolis, the Monastiraki square and everything in the Plaka area. The apartment itself is spacious, well-designed and nicely decorated. You can get a view of a part of the Acropolis from the balcony too. The owner, Tanasi , gave us most of the information we need to know as tourists on the first day we met. Tanasi has also been very helpful when I asked him about places to visit apart from the city center. Those places he recommended are really worth visiting. <br/>It was a pleasant stay at Tanasi’s apartment."
14146634,519783038,2019-08-29,22868605,Marika,We had a fantastic time at Tanasi's apartment. The space was lovely and clean and very spacious.

I was met by a lovely taxi driver at the airport and welcomed to the apartment by Eli who was very friendly and helpful. The apartment was very clean and the fridge stocked with milk and juice (I can't remember what else, that's all I used). Air con worked perfectly and I had a very pleasant and comfortable one night stay. Athanasios' communication was great as I needed somewhere to keep my bags before travelling onwards and he was very helpful and accomodating.

14146634,537870279,2019-09-29,241023067,Lizette,"Our host welcomed us downstairs and walked us through the apartment. We absolutely satisfied with our stay. The view was amazing, we had light breakfast on the balcony every morning. The location is super convenient and easy to walk everywhere. Never had to use public transportation, only a cab to and from the airport which our host arranged for us which was super helpful! This AirBnB made our stay in Athens so welcoming!"
14146634,543090184,2019-10-07,39341691,Ankit,Fantastic space with unforgettable views from the terrace. It was great to just relax outside with a beautiful view of the Temple of Zeus and the Acropolis. Communication was great and check-in was easy.

Great vegan restaurant right below the apartment and walkable distance from the Acropolis. We would definitely go back!

It is very close to the Acropolis and subway stations. There is a restaurant downstairs, and there are many restaurants and supermarkets nearby. It is a very convenient and comfortable apartment. The room is very clean, the balcony is facing the temple of Zeus and has a very good view , we sit on the balcony every day to enjoy the view of the temple. Tanasi has been actively helping us solve all kinds of problems, and also helping us to take care of our luggage when we left. Eli received us and introduced everything we need nearby. Thank you very much, Eli. If I have a chance to go to Athens or someone I know wants to go, I will definitely recommend this apartment."

14146634,566347246,2019-11-19,210164946,Karen,"This AirBnb is great! The views of the temple of Zeus from the apartment are absolutely beautiful. And so conveniently located: within easy walking distance to the Acropolis, the acropolis museum, the Temple of Zeus, Hadrians arch, and many restaurants and bars. The beds were comfortable,  the location was quite quiet, with only some light traffic noise, and the hosts were attentive and easy to communicate with. We didn’t really cook, so I can’t speak to the cooking amenities. All and all, would stay here again."
14146634,566683385,2019-11-20,263276848,Valerie,Excellent location. Excellent service. Highly recommend!!!!
14146634,567722853,2019-11-23,13737635,Linda,"Place is easily within walking distance to the various sites.  Hop on and hop off bus a block away.  Great food at small take out place next to the store, which is on the same block!  Highly recommend.  The view is Fantastic."
14146634,568258883,2019-11-24,12793166,Patricia Judith,"Although we only spent one night, the property exceeded our expectations. The host communicated promptly and arranged a wonderful taxi driver to pick us up at the airport and again to deliver us  back to the airport. The property was well equipped, even with some breakfast articles. Best of all was the location and the view. We were able to walk everywhere and enjoy our short time there. We would highly recommend this apartment."
14146634,570700146,2019-11-30,17477906,Jerry,Fantastic large apartment close to everything. Unbeatable location with beautiful view of the temple of zeus and minutes from plaka and the acropolis. Check in was smooth and communication with host was excellent. Highly recommended!
14146634,572833305,2019-12-04,128313348,Morgan,My favorite place to stay in Athens! Amazing location with the best view! Athanasios and Eli were amazing!
14146634,575021117,2019-12-09,10329605,Jessie,"Expect Anthanasio's place to be big and spacious - there was plenty of space for my family of 4 and our 2 big and 2 small luggages.  The view of Temple of Zeus and also Acropolis from a distance nice as well.  There is a small balcony, so it would be lovely to sit out there in late spring/summer to enjoy the view.<br/><br/>Anthanasio was very responsive and quick throughout the booking process and also during our stay.  Unfortunately the wifi was not up during our stay and he quickly showed up with a SIM card with data plan for my family to use.  He topped it up quickly when we run out as well.  It was not convenient as the kids could not access their devices freely but that simply meant they had to spend time with family :)  And again when we did not know how to work the air conditioner/heater properly, he showed up to tune it for us and even offered to send a technician to look into it but we turned it down as we could manage.<br/><br/>The apartment is very close to Acropolis Museum, Acropolis and also the Panathenaic Stadium.  It is about 15mins walk to Plaka, Syntagma Square - so take note of that if you are looking out to be closer to those centers (but they are very crowded).   As the apartment is closer to residential area you can find inexpensive breakfast cafes."
14146634,580767644,2019-12-23,55106138,Con,By any measure this was simply a first class experience for us. We stayed 16 days and the property and the host were just outstanding. Highly recommended without any hesitation.
14146634,583745787,2019-12-29,53614828,Tim,Outstanding location with fair price. You can walk everywhere. View into temple of Zeus is wonderful. Thanks!

14146634,609046257,2020-02-22,134074979,Will,"The view!  Great location and clean, comfortable accommodations.  Athanasios is an ideal host - quick communications, easy check-in, helpful arranging transportation to and from the airport.  Did I mention the view?  Good eats nearby include:  Veganaki (the vegan restaurant downstairs), Olympian (casual, local hangout), and Meat Me Food Corner (family owned, don’t be fooled by the name and get the falafel sandwich)."
14146634,611535534,2020-02-27,172593361,Alex,Excellent location

14146634,617872757,2020-03-14,196148848,Jennefer,"The apartment was exactly as pictured and the view of the Temple of Zeus is absolutely stunning. The location was great, lots of little markets and great local eateries within walking distance. We were also able to easily walk to the Acropolis, the Temple of Zeus, Syntagma Square, and the areas of Plaka and Monastiraki. In addition, Athanasio gave us great tips on navigating the nearby area, as well as provided complimentary breakfast foods for our first morning there. He was also gracious enough to make several driving accomodations for us including airport pick-up and drop-off and trasnport to and from the port of Piraeus... all for very reasonable prices. We really could not have asked for a kinder host or better central location. We hope to return to Athens again soon and would not hesistate to stay at Athanasio's place again and again!"
14146634,638296737,2020-07-15,190452147,Joe & Ashleigh,"This was the perfect Airbnb! The space is big, modern, and sparkling clean. There are two queen-size bedrooms, a washing machine, a clothes line on the back balcony, an iron & ironing board, a hairdryer, good Wi-Fi, and a big shower. The front balcony faces the Temple of Olympian Zeus directly across the street, and you can see the Acropolis from the front balcony also! AMAZING views! Our host was very helpful & quick to respond to any questions we had.<br/><br/>We were a 4-minute walk from the Akropoli metro station which made getting anywhere in the city easy. There are 3 metro lines in Athens & It’s an easy metro to understand and use. The Acropolis is a 7-minute walk from the Airbnb, the famous Plaka shopping district is an 6-minute walk away, and the Temple of Olympian Zeus is directly across the street.<br/><br/>Pro-Tip: Download the Beat taxi app while in Athens. It’s like Uber, but for Taxis. If you don’t use it, the driver is going to over-charge you. Happened to us twice. When you use the app, it estimates the price of the trip on the app so you don’t over-pay."
14146634,639348956,2020-07-18,177006709,Karine,Très bon emplacement proche de l'acropole et des transports. Logement très propre avec une bonne literie. La vue est superbe.

14146634,664192668,2020-09-14,25366901,Armando,Our expirience in Athanasios appartement was great!. He arranged for us the taxi to go from the airport to his appartment and his driver was waiting for us with my name. He did the same thing for us to go to the airport when we were leaving. The appartment is as in the pictures and it's really clean. The view from the balcony is amazing: we had dinner every night from there. The balcony can be a little bit noisy but the inside the appartement you won't hear a thing: our 1 year old baby didn't have any issue to sleep. He also provided to us a baby crip. We won't hasitate to stay again on Athanasios' appartement next time on Athens.

The apartment is very close to transportation  (easy to get too) and a couple of stop from the Acropolis. The apartment is very spacious, comfortable very clean, and even better than the pictures in the listing. I felt very safe at the location and in the neighborhood. Overall I would highly recommend the location when visiting Athens. "
14162485,124899100,2017-01-03,9552599,Ihor,"It was the best flat I've ever rent on airbnb. It is so exiting to wake up in modern art gallery and to discover something new every time. At the same time the place is very comfortable, has all the things you need. Highly recommended to stay in Athens!"

14162485,142627143,2017-04-09,22486251,Matthias,It was one of the best places I've ever found on Airbnb! Yiouli is a great host. She gave me all needed information (e.g. how to come from the airport to the apartment) even before I thought about searching for them. She was very helpful and even prepared a little something so that I had breakfast the morning after I arrived. The apartment/loft is in the ground flore which comes with a very nice little backyard garden. It was clean and quite generally really nothing to complain about.<br/>I would come back if I have the chance!

14162485,155953752,2017-05-29,94192018,Kristian,I can describe our staying at Yiouli's Studio as one of the highlights of our visit in Athens. Everything was as described or even better. It was a pleasure.
14162485,156550594,2017-05-31,122317969,Faith,"Youli's place is just as the pictures state; wacky and artistic. It takes about 20-30min walk to reach the monuments from Youli's place, or you can opt to take the train. Youli was very organised and allowed us to check in earlier when we told her our flight would arrive early.  Overall my friend and I had a lovely time at her place. "
14162485,160250729,2017-06-13,23869297,Gerard,"I had a very good experience at Yiouli's. Even though my stay was short, I enjoyed my stay! The place was very spacious, clean and it was very convenient for accessing the metro! It is also worth mentioning that Yiouli was very flexible in guiding us to her loft despite our late arrival. I would definitely stay there again the next time I'm in Athens... I recommend it!"

Everything was superb. <br/>Yiouli prepped all maps and info about happenings in Athens at the time of our stay, so we had no problems whatsoever finding what we wished to see or visit.<br/>Thank you "
14162485,169987106,2017-07-14,81719908,Eddy,"The quit huge loftspace is an artistic workshop, very inspiring indeed. Also the accommodation for guest are optimal, the workshop function doesn't disturb at all. A good bed, all kitchen amenities and shower.  The air conditioning was welcome because during our stay it was 37°C in Athens. Very quiet inside.<br/><br/>Although a little side of the main areas, we loved the neighbourhood with local live and a lot of shops. Conveniently situated near the main train station and metro lines."
14162485,171640871,2017-07-18,4845407,Frank,"Yiouli's place was a good deal: it had all the comfort and she welcomed us in a very nice way. It won't make you dream, mainly because of the location which we found to be less pleasant than most of the other areas we discovered in Athens. But as I said: it has all comfort and is close to the subway..."
14162485,172163183,2017-07-20,87674546,Rachael,"Yiouli's place is perfect for a stay in Athens. It is very clean and comfortable, with breakfast supplies provided. The air conditioning is a welcome respite on a hot summer day. There are a lot of eateries, supermarkets and bakeries close by and we walked to the Acropolis in about 25 minutes. Yiouli is lovely and very easy to communicate with and helped us with so many extra things for which we were very grateful. She even organised a taxi from the airport with her friend. We will be returning to Athens to fly home and will stay with Yiouli again."
14162485,174189394,2017-07-25,54112916,Robin,"We had such wonderful days in that place, and Yiouli and her friend took time to show us what to do in the surrounding. Such a great welcoming! The apartment is a quiet place, pleasant to live and hard to leave!"

14162485,182188239,2017-08-14,59838702,Vera,Symphatetic owner(s) with lovely  and bohemian art studio. So inspiring!
14162485,183441333,2017-08-17,19751525,Lino,Die Unterkunft ist zentral gelegen und bietet sehr viel Platz. Man hat einen kleinen Hinterhof indem man seine Wäsche trocknen kann. Die Unterkunft bietet alles was man braucht. Wir würden sie immer wieder buchen.
14162485,193551061,2017-09-14,19635428,Yannick,"Nice place decorated with Yiouli's creation.<br/>The kitchen/bathroom is a little small however the whole flat is perfectly clean, spacious, well decorated and functional.<br/>We did not know Athens and his areas, the flat is perfect to discover it.<br/>Also Yiouli is very flexible on arrival time / departure <br/>Thank you very much"
14162485,198675326,2017-09-30,8185709,Dmitry,"A great and unique place that is an artist's studio. Place is ideal for a couple and has everything you need. Yiouli was very flexible in terms of check in and check out and we have had a quick and easy communication throughout the stay. The only thing is that some streets around a bit dodgy, but this can be said for most of the center of Athens - so as long as you are fine with it, it is a great and unique choice."
14162485,201824486,2017-10-09,149979813,Joseph,"Great place to stay! Big clean living area, with all things catered for that you'll need for your stay like towels etc. Short walk into the city centre, also has a nice kebab place located 2 minutes away which is open late and has good prices. It's also very close to a train station. Yiouli is very helpful too. Definitely recommend the place."
14162485,203471920,2017-10-15,27397227,Juli,"Yiouli is an amazing host. She answered very quickly and was very helpful. The loft is as in the pictures - huge, impressive and very artistic. It's perfect for summer because it's cold inside. Also the little backyard is very nice. <br/>The only 'negative' thing is that it's a bit far from the central places but besides that I would definitely recommend her anytime!"
14162485,206202982,2017-10-24,6272321,Jamie,"Yiouli's place was perfect for our 4 day stay in Athens! <br/>The apartment was one of the most interesting and inspiring ones I've had the chance of staying in. Yiouli provided all the maps we needed and even books with the beautiful scenery of Greece. <br/>It is walkable to Larissa metro & Athens Railway station, and we were taking the metro daily during our stay. The area does not have as many food choices, but there is a supermarket very nearby. We would recommend to have your meals in the main areas like Syntagma/Acropolis before heading back to the apartment by metro. <br/>The WIFI was slightly unstable during our first 2 days, but it seemed to work perfectly in the later part of our stay. Youli was contactable and always available to help, which we were very thankful for.<br/>Highly recommended, one-of-a-kind place!"
14162485,209399656,2017-11-05,44011266,Eva,"La casa corrisponde alle foto, non un vero appartamento ma uno studio arredato. Pulitissima e accogliente, è però rumorosa, poiché ubicata al piano terra, e ha un bagno troppo piccolo e non proprio comodo. La posizione è centrale, in un quartiere molto popolare, e permette di raggiungere facilmente qualsiasi altro punto della città sia a piedi che in metro. Yiouli e suo marito sono stati molto gentili e disponibili."
14162485,211033335,2017-11-12,759228,Bjoern W.,"Special, arty place to stay - a little off the city centre. Yiouli & her husband were very friendly and welcoming."

14162485,216529255,2017-12-04,45705691,Riany,"I hundred persen agreed with all the good reviews from everyone to yiouli and yani’s place. Really a stratrgic one; because it’s near the larissis station;<br/>And they are a super host.. They were very thoughtful to the 3 of us, they help us to booked taxi to the airport  on our check out in 4:00’AM. Very recommended"
14162485,218502537,2017-12-13,49547817,Stella,"Yiouli is very nice and hospitable. I chose her place because I am a big admirer of art and wanted something different. When I asked personally to meet her, she found time to come and see me, which I think was very sweet (even brought me local patisserie)! Thanks Yiouli! <br/>Only I wish the shower/bathroom was little bigger."

14162485,234539941,2018-02-13,114851356,Олександр,"Very interesting design. It is former art-studio. I liked internal garden with orange trees. Location is good, you can walk to any culture places free. I recommend this for everyone who like not typical apartments."

As an artist myself I loved having such creativity all around me :) it’s close to cafes, restaurants, taxis and buses. There’s a heater and AC which I appreciate cause it was a little chilly. <br/><br/>Communication was quick and very helpful. Thank you!!"
14162485,247671190,2018-03-29,35026314,Karen,"Would only recommend as an affordable option for 2 nights or less. <br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Only a few metro stops from Acropolis. <br/>- Responsive host. <br/>- Large space. <br/>- Weekly farmers market nearby (Wednesday’s).<br/>- It’s cheap. <br/>Cons:<br/>- Limited internet. Only 20GB is free, you need to pay for additional. Description falsely advertises “free” internet. A little misleading. We were here for a month and we got the same amount of data as someone staying for one night. <br/>- Forced to pay cash for additional internet, despite there being an Airbnb feature for exactly these situations. Host was unwilling to use (Hidden by Airbnb) or Transferwise as alternatives (no fees for receiver). <br/>- Bathroom is very small and the shower is right on top of the sink/toilet, so everything gets wet. <br/>- The “kitchen” is a plug-in electric stove, so the heat settings/range is pretty limited. <br/>- Being a ground floor apartment it is relatively dusty, so no amount of cleaning makes it less dusty/musky."
14162485,249349349,2018-04-02,7106282,Sima,"Yiouli and her partner were both excellent hosts. Very accomodating, friendly, and quick to respond.<br/>The loft itself is big, well equipped and has a fantastic little courtyard where we enjoyed having our breakfasts in. Centrally located in a neighbourhood that unfortunately looks a bit run down but close to metro so convenient.<br/>I highly recommend this to others!"
14162485,251126101,2018-04-07,50002652,Bertrand,"Un super accueil, un petit jardin privatif, une grande pièce à vivre."

14162485,257478968,2018-04-26,37638822,Egor,"My girlfriend and I loved staying at Yiouli's place. The only thing i wish they could approve is wi-fi as at times it seemed there wasn't any..<br/>However if you are a girl and plan to stay here alone or with some other female friends, this neighborhood may not be safe when coming back home after sunset. Very dark with many drunk and high people, so bear this in mind if you are into parties  and staying up late."
14162485,260228942,2018-05-04,45106116,Becky,Quirky and cool studio apartment with extremely helpful hosts! The studio is really close to the metro with the centre only a few stops away! The fridge was stocked with breafast snacks and the hosts were so helpful when we were trying to travel from the airport! Would definetly reommend.
14162485,262564251,2018-05-09,48841394,Pubenza,"The Neighborhood is dirty, smells bad, far from all touristic activities.<br/>The bathroom  floor is slippery , and to (Website hidden by Airbnb) was a garage, so it is direct connected to the street.People should tell them how many sheets they will need.<br/>This is a “Loft for very young people."
14162485,263862229,2018-05-13,28208186,Pascale,"Bonne prise de contact de notre hôtesse avec des explications claires pour arriver<br/>Les photos du studio ne reflètent pas la réalité, par exemple ne montrent pas qu’il n’y a pas de lumière du jour, fenêtres occultées et qu’il s’agit plutôt d’un entresol aménagé. Il faut descendre 4 marches pour y accéder. <br/>Pas de salle de bain à proprement parlé mais un coin douche/wc très réduit.<br/> La nuit , le quartier n’est pas très engageant, porte cadenassée !!<br/>Le côté atelier ne permet pas une propreté au top: poussière sur les canapés et œuvres d’art.<br/>A plus de 20minutes du centre ville (marche +métro) <br/>Pour nous, pas une bonne expérience"

14162485,272270042,2018-06-03,34158091,Ioana,"This place has great connectivity with everything - you are 5 minutes from a metro (Larissa station) where you can get an express line to the airport, and most days we just walked everywhere! You can pass by the market on the way to the center where you have some of the best & most authentic places to grab a bite to eat (like Ta Karamanlidika). We enjoyed the openness of the space and it had a very comfortable bed, much better than some hotels we stayed at. Yiouli and Yannis were very accommodating and  very quick to answer anytime needed. We had everything we could need for a few days stay at their place and would stay here again when we come back to Athens! It is a great place to experience the full spirit of the city! <3"

Though some may not like that the shower wets all of the bathroom, it has good pressure and heat so we were fine :) Also a lot of thoughtful bits and pieces with breakfast, extra universal adapter, emergency female hygiene products, extra blanket.. It's a little further away from the touristy locations but the train was easy to take and there is a yummy (local?) greek restaurant nearby with cheap gyros etc"

They allowed us a slight late check out to accommodate for the flight timing and were there punctually for the keys. The apartment has the added advantage of having the metro station and the main Larissa railway station both in easy walking distance. There's a direct train from the airport to the main railway station which takes just 50 minutes, and the apartment is located 5 minutes walk from there. We had a comfortable stay and appreciated Yiouli and her husband s hospitality. "

The hosts are very friendly, we only met Yiouli’s husband and we kept in contact with yiouli through the app and text. It is very easy to get around city with metro, and the Larissa Station, which is the closest one, is only 5 min walk from the place. There was some food/ drinks in the fridge which was nice! Many tourist info in the table in the living room help tourists getting around. And the cherry on top are the beautiful exculptures around the place that makes it magical! Thank you Yiouli, if I come back to Athens one day I wouldn’t try other airbnb! "

I would love to give more stars to their place but I found it a bit cold and damp. The toilet us small, with no shower plate so after taking a shower the floor is cover in water making its use very uncomfortable. The decoration is very arty but the location is not very nice, I did not feel safe walking around the area, but big number of streets had the same feeling, I guess Athens is like that."

Yiouli is very nice, the communication was fluent and she had many information material on Athens prepared at the AirBNB. The metro station is super close, but if you like walking you can also walk to the most famous tourist sights. On my last day I had to leave really early and even for this case we found a great solution!"

14162485,492073013,2019-07-21,14461362,Gabriel Ioan,"We stayed for two nights at Yiouli's place, during the hot summer days of July. But you don't need to worry about the heat, as the studio is equipped with a powerful air conditioning. The studio has all the necessary that is needed for a long stay trip, like washing machine or stove,  and it even has access to a private garden. The only negative is the location, the studio it's not on the best streets of Athens. It's relative proximity to the city centre, and the great  price makes this seem a less of a problem.  The hosts are great, they  are responsive and nice, which made our short visit to Athens a welcoming experience. <br/><br/>Ross and Gabi"

We did choose to get a cab home late at night due to some other guests concerns about the area, but it's the same in any city really and it only cost €3.50 from the centre. Enjoyed our stay at the studio, good value for money and we would stay again if in the area. Yiouli was a lovely host and even let us check out later in the day which was really useful. Recommend!"

It was interesting to live in such an unusual place!<br/> 2 km from the Acropolis and very close to the station to get to the South of Athens or the Airport.  Nearby are supermarkets and what is very pleased in this area are several local male and female Ateliers, which sell fur coats and men's jackets and other clothes at a price lower than all the others that we saw while walking on.<br/> The courtyard of the apartment is nice, had breakfast there every day.<br/> Everything is fresh and washed, and even the decorative pillows smoothed out smelled of freshness. <br/><br/>Хорошее и уютное место! Много деталей но все очень чистое! Было интересно жить в таком необычном месте!<br/>2 км от Акрополя и очень близко со станцией что бы добраться до Юга Афин или Аэропорта. Рядом супермаркеты и что очень порадовало в этом районе несколько местных мужских и женских Ателье, в который продаются шубы и мужские куртки и другая одежда по цене ниже всех остальных, которые мы видели гуляя дальше. <br/>Дворик у апартаментов милый, завтракали там каждый день.<br/>Все свежие и выстирано, и выглажено даже декоративные подушки пахли свежестью."

14173004,169690674,2017-07-13,13336465,Andrea,"Our stay in Athens was perfect, thanks to our wonderful host, Panos and his fabulous 'space'. Panos was so friendly, helpful and quick to answer any questions, before and during, our time in Athens. He had some treats waiting for us on arrival (and more on our departure) and many suggestions about places to shop, eat and visit.  On our last night we took a taxi ride to a restaurant recommended by Panos and it was one of our food highlights! My husband and son wanted to visit a venue from the 2004 Olympics and Panos was straight on the phone to check details for them. What a gentleman. We were 2 families, 8 people and the space was ideal (and fun) for us. Its location is really central, close to great bars, restaurants, a little supermarket and bakery and we walked to museums, gardens, shopping, changing the guard, and whilst we took a hop-on hop-off bus, we could have walked to the Acropolis as well. The accommodation was a serene, sparkling oasis, a sanctuary amongst the relentless heat and energy of Athens in July. Of course you can see how beautiful the space is in the pictures, clean and white with some fun touches of colour, texture and original artwork. It was super clean and comfortable and the verandah area was an incredible added bonus. I highly recommend Athens Soho Lofts if you are the type who will appreciate and respect the thought that has gone into putting this space together and the genuine warmth of Panos. "

14173004,252563521,2018-04-11,40149372,Rabia,"A beautiful apartment, which offers excellent value for money. You can stay with up to 8 persons and you have to bathrooms. Very comfortable and clean. The location is very good, because it is close to the main attractions and there are numerous bars/restaurants around. The only downside is that it can be noisy at night due to these bars. Panos is a great host, we arrived at 2am, but he was very friendly. He gave us good tips and a map. He also reached out in between and arranged a good van for transfer from and to the airport for us at a good price."

As a large group of 7 friends we could not have found somewhere more ideal to stay! We also asked the host to leave our bags there after our checkout until our flight which was in the evening and not only he made us that accommodation but he also let us stay in the flat until our flight. We really had an amazing stay and would definitely visit again! Thanks for everything Panos, sunny greetings from Cyprus :)"

Il loft è fantastico e insolito, la terrazza un perfetto luogo per potersi rilassare. Avendo prenotato entrambi i locali, quindi loft e appartamento, avevamo la struttura completamente privata e ciò ha contribuito indubbiamente alla nostra esperienza positiva. È possibile raggiungere a piedi con un massimo di 20 minuti qualsiasi cosa, e si è completamente immersi nella vita dei locali ateniesi. Un market umile ma completo è situato appena a 20 metri dalla porta di casa, e nella via adiacente è possibile trovare ristoranti tipici molto economici. Consigliatissimo"

Upon check in we were greeted and provided with baked goods which was a nice personal touch.<br/><br/>Beds: The beds were strategically laid out to give this space an open concept. We were a group of 7 and I never once felt like we were on top of each other. We had more than enough room. The beds were comfortable. <br/><br/>Cleanliness: The loft was meticulously clean which is important during the pandemic. I can tell Nikos takes a lot of pride being a host. <br/><br/>Extra amenities: Nice rooftop balcony. AC and Wifi were working properly. Hot running water provided. Water, soda, juices, toiletries, more than enough toilet paper, paper towels, the place was well stocked with whatever we may have needed.<br/><br/>Accuracy: Everything in the airbnb listing was accurate. <br/><br/>Overall it was a great stay.

Nous vous remercions beaucoup tous les 6.<br/>Appartement très propre.... Manque juste un peu de luminosité car les fenêtres sont très petites.<br/>Je recommande vivement cet appartement à tout le monde de passage à Athènes."
14173004,479475488417195728,2021-10-23,142477502,Guillaume,"Top apartment !<br/>Localisation is just perfect, many restaurants, bars at less than 5 minutes by walk. It's the same thing for the big monuments or cultural activities, the most famous are around 10 minutes, 15 maximum!<br/><br/>About the apartment, it was perfectly what me and my friends needed. A big place, everyone had his own good bed and we all have enough space to not walk on the each others.<br/><br/>And the last but not the least, Nicos is the best host that I've met. He his really nice and friendly and if you need advise or something else he will be there for you !<br/><br/>So don't hesitate, take this apartment!"
14176086,98962230,2016-09-02,7455468,Nino,"I was Konstantinos' first guest! He owns this lovely old large flat right on Victoria Square. You'll be charmed by the stylish decor, the wooden floor, the high ceilings, the amazing breezy polyhedric balcony (perfect for people watching), the huge room, the extreme cleanliness and, above all, by the host's endearing personality. You'll have the impression you're visiting a friend. A polite and non intrusive friend too. Although the area can be noisy, the triple glazing in the AC-fitted manorial bedroom makes sure that at night you'll only hear yourself breathing. Victoria Square is a great neighbourhood, buzzing with people, shops, cafes... And very central too: metro is at the doorstep, Exharhia and the National Museum literally 5 minutes walk away.  <br/><br/>All in all, I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely come back. "
14176086,101741518,2016-09-15,61431255,Lisa,"I had really nice time with Konstantinos. The place is central, two metro stations from acropolis or 20 min by walking,really nice and tidy, and Konstantinos is open minded guy, friendly and easy going.
<br/>I had a small view about warm Greek welcome.
<br/>Thanks a lot Konstantinos, and see you somewhere "
14176086,107600821,2016-10-11,18235047,Beihua,"The place is great! 
<br/>It's right on top of the Victoria subway station. Easy to get to everywhere and the national museum is within walking distance.
<br/>The room is big enough with high ceiling and a balcony. The mattress is very comfortable.
<br/>The host, Konstantinos is even greater. He is very nice and helpful. He gave me a map and showed me the interesting places. He took me to a very good local restaurang and walked around the Acropalis together with me at a beautiful night.
<br/>He even got up at 5:30 am in the morning on my last day in Athens to prepare breakfast for me to let me to catch my 8:30am fiight.
<br/>Konstantinos is wonderful! He is eactly the Airbnb experience I am looking for. Thanks a lot!

14176086,109763458,2016-10-23,95387800,Andrew,"This home has such a great view of the square and Victoria station. It really is a good spot to watch all the people coming and going from the square. Although the square/station is pretty lively for most of the day, the room has 2 sets of french doors that keep the noise out, so once you close the doors you feel a lot more private. The balcony is big enough for a small table and 2-3 chairs and it's nice to sit outside in the early mornings with a hot cup of Greek coffee or cold beer in the (whatever time you want - you're on vacation!) The photos don't do the property justice. The vibe of everything seems like it has lived through generations and it feels really cool to be apart of it. The white marble kitchen sink is over 100 years old! Everything you need is provided, from cold bottled water, juice, greek coffee, fresh local fruits to wifi, full kitchen with microwave, extra clean towels, thick blankets, a/c unit & heaters, essential toiletries and he even lent me his personal umbrella when there was a big thunderstorm! On top of all that, he is a talented artist, ask him to show you his work! It was great to stay in this home because you can be in the train station in 1 minute from your room if you're really in a hurry, and same with any food/snacks at 3-4am because the restaurant and stands downstairs are 24/7. One note to anyone staying here, try the souvlaki/kebab place downstairs when you see it - I only remember seeing it open in the evenings (it wasn't open during the day time on my last day so I missed out on that!)"

14176086,149874757,2017-05-06,18944167,Claudia,"Konstantinos ist der perfekte Gastgeber. In seiner großzügigen, schön gestalteten und eingerichteten Altbauwohnung (die Fotos versprechen nicht zuviel) fehlt es an nichts und man fühlt sich sofort wie zu Hause. Direkt an der Metrostation gelegen und um die Ecke vom Archäologischen Nationalmuseum und dem Kneipenviertel Exarchia gibt es für Alleinreisende oder Paare kaum einen optimaleren Ort für einen Athenbesuch. Platz und Straße  vor dem Haus sind quirlig, aber wenn man die Doppeltür zum Balkon schließt können auch Lärmempfindliche ruhig schlafen.<br/><br/>Zum echten Erlebnis wird der Aufenthalt aber durch Konstantinos besondere Offenheit und Gastfreundschaft. Er denkt an alles, ist wahnsinnig nett und zuvorkommend, immer ansprechbar und auch bei einer Tour durch die Kneipen des Viertels ein spannender Gesprächspartner, der einem das Athener Lebensgefühl näher bringen will. Konstantinos teilt bereitwillig die Wohnung mit seinen Gästen, alle zentralen Räume sind offen zugänglich​. Nach einer Woche habe ich mich fast als Athenerin gefühlt ;-) und würde sofort wiederkommen. "
14176086,151802372,2017-05-14,129833582,Kenny,"It is centrally LOCATED, and you are in the heart of the city.   Everything is within a subway/train/metro or an inexpensive taxi ride.   An experience so worth it, and you won't get a better host.  <br/><br/>"

I loved chilling on the couch and enjoyed the sunlight from the big window. And the kitchen has some essentials, so it’s good for a long stay too. Located right heart of Athens. Being just a few minutes away from Syntagma metro station, it is a great place to stay in. The host was very friendly. Thank you very much! I’ll most definitely come back here!"

14194511,100215081,2016-09-08,43823728,Scott,"Marcin's apartment was largely to my satisfaction, being clean with wifi and having a good sized balcony. However, the cooktop in the kitchen did not work (and no instructions were provided), there are some dogs kept on nearby balconies which make a lot of noise, and I was not given the name of the door buzzer before my arrival at the agreed time. Not having the buzzer details meant I waited on the street for some time only to have to obtain mobile phone credit to make an international call to Marcin so he could contact the cleaner inside to bring me the keys. I believed someone would be meeting me outside at the nominated time. Better communication about key handover is suggested. The area surrounding the apartment is not particularly interesting, but the walk to Attica or Victoria train stations is easy enough."

There is a supermarket really close from the flat and there is also a few night shops around it. The apartment is good-located, almost everything is at a walking distance, and the taxi doesn't cost a fortune (3€ to go to the center)."
14194511,101937133,2016-09-16,74105946,Julia,"Great place! We arrived really late at night, around midnight, and there still was someone to welcome us in the flat. The apartment is really nice, the bathroom even has a washing machine. The kitchen is equipped really well, so you could cook your own meals, and not go to restaurants if you're on a tight budget. It is a comfortable accomodation for four people - it was really comfy for three of us. We were provided with all the bed linen and towels. The air conditioning works perfectly. The tarrace is a very nice place to eat breakfast or just sit and chill in the afternoon or evening. Marcin is really nice and kind, and the communication was great. We hope to visit again!"
14194511,104360300,2016-09-26,93896114,Lisa,The flat was very nice and tidy as it is shown in the pictures. We had a good time there and especially enjoyed the beautiful balcony. It can is reached easy by the metro and the food market in the next street is definitiv worth visiting. Marcin was a very helpful host and it was no problem to stay for a day longer even if we decided that only spontaneously when er were already there. So we can definitly recommend staying there for a weekend.

14194511,122377939,2016-12-23,27276270,Derek,Stayed here with my two friends. It was  a good size for the 3 of us and has a nice balcony. The hot water for the shower was a little (Website hidden by Airbnb) started out hot and then got quite cold. Marcin was very responsive and check-in was smooth.
14194511,123432350,2016-12-29,108151924,Stavros,Booking this house was a great choice.The host took care of all the important stuff for a nice three days stay.

14194511,137559844,2017-03-16,103543625,Julia,"We stayed for 5 days at Marcin's appartment in a Group of four. As the Pictures of the appartment looked quite inviting and the evaluation was good, we decided to book. Contact with Marcin was really problem-free, frequent answering and very friendly. Unfortunetly the appartment was not that clean, especially the bathroom. The setting and the surroundings were really ugly and looked quite poor, but it was a fast way to the train. For visiting Athens it's okay and we would recommend the value for Money. So all in all we were a Little disappointed, but it was really cheap to stay, so if you are not sophisticated for a short stay, book the Apartment."
14194511,141057477,2017-04-02,37778149,Olena,"Апартаменты находятся в хорошем месте. Недалеко метро (600 м), очень близко хороший недорогой супермаркет, в 20 метрах (только в субботу) рынок где можно купить фрукты , овощи, оливки, оливковое масло (очень вкусное), рыбу, креветки . Район очень тихий (рядом полицейский участок). Квартира просторная, чистая, приятный балкончик, удобная кухня. Был только один неприятный момент. На постеле была приличная про (Hidden by Airbnb) еная дыра. Когда меняли постель её явно видели и специально перевернули одеялом вовнутрь. Мы написали хозяину ответа не дождались. Это не испортило нам приятного отдыха. Апартаменты рекомендую. "
14194511,143024958,2017-04-10,2647479,Anais,"Though we had a rocky arrival (the apartment wasnt ready and cleaning lady was 40 minutes late), we enjoyed our stay at Macin's apartment. We were out working and visiting all day and just came back to crash and its a good apartment for that. We really enjoyed having breakfast on the terrasse or a beer in the early evening. The apartment is a perfect size 2-3 people but would be tight for more. The bathroon is quite small and not updated. However the terrasse and bedroom balcony are great features. The apartment is not central, but easily accessible by public transport. The market on Saturday morning is worth visiting. "

Also market on Saturday was fun! TaxiBeat app to travel to-from downtown made travel fast and safe! Late arrival at night, you may find section of street in front of apartment closed to traffic because police station in front of building- they do this for safety - do not worry about it! Very greek neighborhood and no it is not ugly , it is just not ""6ème arro dissement de Paris""! Us ,Canadians, recommand the place. Communication with OWNER really deficient upon arrival - no contacts with us days before arrival but his friend arranged proper check-in and owner let us check-in early which we appreciated a lot!"
14194511,156317832,2017-05-30,31993629,Björn,"We had a very pleasant stay in Marcins appartment. The size was perfect for the two of us. Located near Metro lines 1 and 2 (Attiki or Victoria station), all points of interest are reachable within 10 minutes or so. A supermarket is in the same street just 2minutes away. Bathroom was a little bit small but totally sufficient. A highlight is the balcony to round off the day! We'd definitely recommend this appartment! "
14194511,159624633,2017-06-11,16911861,Eve,It's a comfortable apartment into an older building in a residential district near to the metro's station Attiki (lign 1 - lign of the Piraeus's port). They are fewer tourist around but the local life is rich <br/>especially during the Saturday market. A total immersion in the Greek actual life out of the antique's site. The terrasse is remarkable.

Grandios ist der Balkon, auf dem man an einem lauen Abend gar nicht merkt, wie schnell die Zeit vergeht. Was etwas fehlt, sind, wenn man sich nicht in der Umgebung auskennt, Restaurants."

14194511,343075466,2018-10-30,56170690,Marc,Eine wunderschöne Wohnung in einem schwierigen Viertel. Eine Polizeistation vor der Haustür sorgt für Sicherheit.
14194511,590698447,2020-01-09,187962728,Reda,"Unresponsive host as he’s not based in Athens. He introduced us to a friend of his but communication was very difficult. WiFi didn’t work and there was no heating system. Only a small electrical heater which was clearly not enough for January as temperatures were below 6 degrees in the evening. So the flat was very cold. As to the location, if you’re coming as a tourist it may not be the side of Athens you want to see and it’s rather far away from the historical part of Athens. <br/>Booked it for a month but as the heating problem was unsolvable and the host unresponsive, had to report it to the Airbnb support team and they moved me to another flat."
14194511,627540393,2020-06-03,40478393,Marie,Logement spacieux et agréable. Le balcon est très appréciable. Je conseille également pour un long séjour. Mais il faut penser à acheter le minimum nécessaire avant d'arriver il n'y avait aucun papier toilette ni de quoi faire la vaisselle.

14208866,94298016,2016-08-15,28175898,Juliann,Athina was a perfect host! I only stayed in her apartment for one night but I wish I could have stayed longer. The place is so cute but she's still waiting on Airbnb professional photos so the current ones really don't depict how fun the space is! I was pleasantly surprised. Athina and her mom own a decor shop and the space is decorated to a tea!! Stay here. It's close to everything worth seeing in Athens. She even provided light snacks and orange juice :)
14208866,94556652,2016-08-16,23489793,Matthias,"OUTSTANDING and PERFECT!!! Everything is pretty in this apartment! 
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood, but close to the Acropolis and the center. It is very close to nice two pedestrian roads where you’ll find bars and restaurants. It is very well equipped and the WIFI works smoothly. 
<br/>
<br/>Athina was very kind, giving advice on where to go. She also prepared a nice breakfast for the next morning. She even had small welcoming for our two kids!"
14208866,95947993,2016-08-21,90013278,Philippe,"We stayed 3 nights in Athina's place, and the first words that come to our minds is ""feel like home in this little, cosy, quiet appartment"". You will find there all confort necessary,  you will stay close to the old town and Acropole,  and Athina will do do all she can to help you. You can send her messages, the answer will arrive in the following minutes ! Our daughter really felt like home and loved to spend time in the cute little terrace where she decided she would take her breakfast. This appartment feels LIFE. We hoped to spend our last two nights in Greece, but unfortunately it was already reserved.. Our first choice there!"
14208866,96734713,2016-08-24,7579514,Matthew & Rachel,We loved staying at Athina's place. It's easily the prettiest Airbnb we've ever been in and the little thoughtful touches and her assistance with transportation were invaluable.  The location was great too - walking to the Acropolis and old town was easy and safe. We'll definitely stay again!
14208866,97602170,2016-08-28,43147112,Casey,Athina's place was amazing. only stayed for a short time but wish we could of stayed longer. Athina was extremely helpful organizing a driver to pick us up from the airport and pick us up early in the morning. Only a short walk to see all the ancient sites in Athens. Would happily stay there again. 
14208866,98274918,2016-08-30,4271115,Bonu,"Athina's place is like stepping into a magazine photo shoot- it is absolutely exquisite.  It is so beautiful and comfortable in every way.  Athina herself was outstanding at communication, extremely accomadating and kind.  the spot is walking distance from everything you might need, metro station, acropolis, lots of great restaurants- do not wait- BOOK NOW"
14208866,98466202,2016-08-31,17518442,Hamza,"The apartment was very clean and well presented.

14208866,99478965,2016-09-05,48706407,Mary,"This was an amazing place to stay and Athina was the perfect host!  The apartment itself is adorable, has a great balcony and is so much more comfortable than a hotel room.  The amenities that Athina provides are over the top - fresh fruit, juice, wine, toasts with spreads, coffee & tea.  We couldn't ask for better.  The neighborhood is great too - not touristy, but plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops to make it attractive.  You're super close to the Metro or just a quick walk to Plaka and the Acropolis.  It really is the perfect spot."

Her place is only 10-15 minutes walking to Acropolis, thus it is very convenient (plus there's a super market directly in front of her building, very convenient for us who cooked our own dinner). Athina herself is super nice. I broke one of her plate (I'm so sorry, Athina) but she doesn't fuss about it. she also came to pick us in front of the metro station near her place. Before, she told us clearly how to get to her place and help us with our enquiry. Good communication and good accommodation. Very recommended.<br/>"

It was located close to all the amenities that a visitor would need (supermarket, pharmacy, hairdresser, tourist help advisory centre) and the main tourists attractions but also made us feel part of the Athens of the Greeks. Athina was very friendly, helpful and always contactable. She made us feel so at home with her gestures of Greek hospitality and was always very accommodating. We felt very at home here and we would recommend it highly to future visitors. "

Everything is just the way it looks in the photos.  The laundry machine in the bathroom is very convenient as well. The kitchen is well stocked and perfect for breakfast & coffee in the morning, especially on the balcony. The neighborhood is quiet but has two streets nearby with lots of cafes bars and restaurants, an easily walk-able area.  It is well situated close to public transportation, 1 metro stop away from Acropoli, and allows for easy travel to other tourist areas and ruins sites.  Would highly recommend this cozy place!"

She was very attentive and explained everything to us. Athina anticipated a lot of our needs (coffee, breakfast, towels, even laundry). <br/>The place itself is very cute and clean. The balcony was great to drink wine and relax.  The location is absolutely amazing! We were able to walk to the Acropolis within 10 minutes. The metro is also very close.

I was finishing up a month of travel and was nervous that I would get bored with 4 days in Athens. Athina' s place felt like home and has been my best airbnb experience since I have started using it."
14208866,139959516,2017-03-27,54384226,Carole,Very cute apartment. It is small but the way Athina has it decorated it is very comfortable and livable. The bed is good and the pillows are excellent. The area is typical residential Athens. There is a grocery store right across the street and coffee houses and restaurants two short blocks away. Major attractions are in walking distance. I would definitely recommend this apartment!

Big space , very cozy , with beautiful balcony all facing to the courtyard which makes the place super quiet.

Nice touch! <br/><br/>Pictures of the B&B are really representative of what the place is - cute and comfortable.

Athina nous attendais sur le trottoir devant son logement ! L'appartement est super sympa, très bien décoré, original.

L'appartement est chaleureux, calme, bien équipé et bien situé ( à 10 minutes à pied de l'Acropole et de la Plaka) Nous avons apprécié tous les produits mis gratuitement à notre disposition: café, sucre, beurre, œufs, fruits et jusqu'à une bouteille de vin blanc. Un supermarché se trouve juste en face de l'appartement. Une boulangerie (excellente) se trouve dans une rue voisine. Nous avons passé 5 jours agréables dans cet appartement. Nous y reviendrions volontiers à la fois pour l'appartement et la ville d'Athènes qui mérite qu'on s'y attarde et qu'on la découvre ou redécouvre dans chacun de ses quartiers."

The street had some good restautant options.<br/>The place was near Acropolis but little far from marketplaces like Monastiraki and Syntagma squares (walkable but far). Athina also gave us thr map and explained a lot of things, she also suggested us some good places to eat and was very helpful. Overall it was a great stay and i would strongly recommend. "

14208866,149210346,2017-05-03,69130577,Himansh,"The word perfect would find the most appropriate meaning if it decides to stay at Athina's place. The location is brilliant, right opposite a super market, and Vodafone store(in case u need a sim). Hardly 20 steps to a pharmacy​, another 20 to a great restaurant. Hardly 10 minutes walk to acropolis. Taxi availability prompt. <br/><br/>Coming to the room, again absolute perfection, I have never seen such a nice sense of decor in any apartment I ever stayed at. Everything was awe inspiring, and the photos would tell u the rest. "

14208866,150450046,2017-05-08,103618539,Emily,"Athina's apartment was the perfect spot for our 2 night stay in Athens.<br/><br/>Location: It was located on a quiet street very close to the Plaka district and within walking distance from the Parthenon. Great for those who prefer to walk everywhere. <br/>Airport transfers: Athina was able to arrange taxis to and from the airport which made our transfers much easier. Both drivers were very knowledgable about Athens, provided some travelling tips and made us feel safe.<br/>Unit: The apartment was exactly as pictured! We appreciated the AC unit and washer/dryer for laundry. Athina has added a lot of artwork and unique collectables throughout the apartment that made it feel like a one-of-a-kind spot. We bought a plug adapter ( I believe C or F) at a little shop in the Plaka district, but only used it to charge our iPhones. <br/>Host: Athina was able to greet us in person and was able to give us an overview of the area and unit. She was available by phone and messaging for any questions we had. She was also kind enough to allow us to leave our bags after check out while we explored the city before our next flight. <br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay here and I would recommend this spot to many travellers."
14208866,151103283,2017-05-11,60416457,Taylor,"Athina is definitely a 5 star hostess! Not only was the apartment clean and cute, but it was close to many of the tourist attractions as well as restaurants, shops, etc. The apartment is exactly as pictured - super adorable and cozy. Athina left eggs, butter, biscuits, wine, juice and fruit for us which was great.  Her quick response time and helpful nature made our stay so wonderful.  Athina recommended Astir Beach for us since we were looking for a nice beach day at the end of our stay, and she also set up all the taxis quick as a flash.  Not only was the beach a huge highlight, but she made everything so simple for us. We would definitely recommend Athina's place to anybody looking for a quiet retreat close to many historic sites and amenities - you won't be disappointed!"

She offered the taxi to pick us up from the airport for €40. We were group of 4 so that was pretty convenient. The taxi driver waited for us with a sign of my name so easy to spot. Athina as well ordered the taxi for us to Piraeus port for €20. She was very very helpful. Now, her place is amazing! So so pretty and clean. The decoration in her balcony was "" (Hidden by Airbnb) worthy"" :) she left us juice, eggs, and breads for breakfast even though we didn't take any. I would totally stay here again if we come back to Athens. "

Μας βοήθησε να βρούμε θέση στάθμευσης μπροστά στο σπίτι και μας υποδέχτηκε στην είσοδο στην άφιξή μας στις 12:00 τα μεσάνυχτα. Το διαμέρισμα πολύ όμορφο και καθαρό, προετοιμασμένο με εντυπωσιακή προσοχή στη λεπτομέρεια από άποψη φροντίδας και διακόσμησης. Γενικά η διαμονή ήταν πάρα πολύ ευχάριστη!"

Our time in Athens was very short, but she helped us make the most of our half day there. <br/><br/>Booking and communication was a breeze! She offered to arrange a taxi for us from the airport, but wanting to experience the public transit, we opted for the metro from the airport. She then met us at the train station and walked us to her apartment.<br/><br/>Her apartment is so wonderfully decorated (just like the photos!) and equipped with a kitchen, full bathroom, wash machine, and had all the amenities I think one would need for any stay. There is an ATM next door to the apartment and a supermarket across the street. She provided maps of the area, and gave us clear directions to the Acropolis, and also gave great recommendations for restraurants/bars off the tourist track on a nearby pedestrian street. <br/><br/>She also arranged a taxi for us when she learned we had to leave very early the next morning. We were very happy with our brief stay in Athens thanks to her, and hope that we can return sometime to stay longer in her apartment. Don't pass this place up if you have the chance to stay!"

De ligging was ook heel goed. In tien minuten sta je te voet in het centrum van Athene. Athina bestelde een taxi voor ons die ons ophaalde aan de luchthaven. Ze wachtte ons op om het appartement te tonen en wat tips te geven over de stad. Daarna was ze constant bereikbaar voor verdere vragen. Een topadresje."

14208866,191869318,2017-09-09,84016958,Craig,"Awesome apartment in central Athens. Walking distance to all the main attractions including the acropolis - but away from the touristy area of Plaka.<br/>Athina was the perfect host, even arranging a taxi for our 5am arriving flight and meeting us in person at 5.30am to check into the room. Nothing was ever too much trouble for her including recommending local restaurants to visit (all of which were great). The apartment is beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. Highly recommended."
14208866,193033321,2017-09-12,38798231,Cassandra,"We had an amazing experience staying at athinas place.  The apartment was extremely adorable and comfortable - we enjoyed staying our mornings with breakfast (fruits and eggs provided by the host)  on the cute little balcony.  You cannot beat the location. We walked everywhere,  although some of the waking was quite far. you could have easily taken public transit in that case,  but we like to walk.  It's only 10 minutes to the acropolis! The plaka is a bit further,  and the ancient Agora and stadium ended up being about a 25 minute walk. Athina have us many suggestions,  all of which were great!  Our only regret is that our stay wasn't longer so we could have done everything on our list."
14208866,193318327,2017-09-13,136484647,Isha,Athina was an amazing host and her place is stunning with a beautiful balcony. Metro station is within walking distance.

Would definitely stay at her place again!
14208866,194543423,2017-09-17,23052676,Katherine,"Athina made our stay absolutely wonderful. She greeted us at the metro station to help us navigate (super easy!) and made sure we had everything we needed. There is a grocery store across the street and it's absolutely lovely to start your day with breakfast on her balcony. If you want to explore Athens but escape tourists at the end of the day, this is the place to be!"

The host was very friendly and she even came in early to get our beds ready. I had booked the place a little late and she went out of her way to make sure the place was ready in time for our stay. She even helped us with directions, tips, or any questions we had about the city. An overall very pleasant experience and a 5 star host. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! :)"

The space was clean and perfect for the three of us. She even had fruits and eggs in the refrigerator for us to cook breakfast! She was very nice and offered a lot of recommendations on our first night, complete with a detailed map of the city. We really appreciated that and enjoyed our stay! I would highly recommend Athina's apartment to anyone who wants to explore Athens."
14208866,199536896,2017-10-02,137599092,Retha,Athina is aresponsive and helpful hostess. Her place is clean and welcoming. Very convenient. A great home away from home in Athens.

14208866,202446982,2017-10-11,1848441,William,"What can I say? I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. It started with Athina arranging a pick up at the airport. Nothing better after flying all night than to have your name on a sign and a cab to whisk you through streets to the place. The super nice cab driver called Athina as we approached and she literally met us at the cab door to take us to the apartment. It was perfect! After just a few minutes, my wife said she wished with could stay our entire 12 days there. The little touches made you feel right at home. Place was immaculate. The bed was large and comfortable  and private from living area. Bathroom was good with good water pressure and small clothes washer. The building is an elevator bldg and the apartment in back of building, so extremely quiet from street noise. My favorite part however is the neighborhood. We went on a short trip to Rhodes and upon return we had to book another place because Athina's was booked.  Even though that neighborhood was fine, we literally double booked another place right up the street from Athina's because we loved the neighborhood so much. It is totally safe. And you can easily walk to the Acropolis, the Acropolis Museum (must see) and all the sites of Athens. Our first night we wandered up to the Acropolis to look around and found a free concert at the Odeon. Even being strangers and in our 60s, we felt perfectly comfortable walking through the neighborhood at night. But it it a totally non-tourist neighborhood. Almost our entire experience were with the friendly Greek locals.  Best of all, the apartment is only a couple of blocks from a tree-lined, pedestrians-only three block plaza filled with the most amazing outdoor cafes, bakeries and restaurants. Take Athina's advice on the ones to visit first and then experiment. Remember anything that cost more than 6 Euros in Greece, you should share because it will be huge. DEFINITELY take Athina's advice for the breakfast cafe. Huge mound of scramble eggs, smoked salmon and brioche with cream cheese for 5 Euros, in a cool, people watching atmosphere! What's not to like? We are veteran Airbnb people who have stayed all over the world in places and this may be our favorite. I definitely could spend months here. Thanks Athina."
14208866,203391239,2017-10-15,22290307,Cynthia,Athina is a wonderful host! The proximity of the apartment is perfect and such a lovely place to relax at the end of the day!

14208866,206630759,2017-10-26,135955734,Mohit,"Athina is a great host. Her replies are super fast so If you need any help before or during the trip you have her to rely upon. The apartment is at a great location. 5-7 min to the metro station, opposite to the Vodafone store and a supermarket.. all great locations are very near. She left us with some fruits and wine which we really appreciate. Thanks for the help Athina. We highly recommend your place to others."
14208866,207458577,2017-10-29,9121523,Sheila,"Athina is a lovely host with a great little apartment in a wonderful location in Athens. She was so wonderfully accommodating and communicative with us. The apartment is cute with a nice balcony and all the amenities you need. The location is dope, just so close to the Plaka, Acropolis and a bunch of little cafes and restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay here!"
14208866,208139740,2017-10-31,23198714,Gillian,"Athina’s apartments are seriously PERFECT. They make you feel like you’re at home. They’re so comfortable, with just the right amount of added touches. I’ve now stayed in her apartments 3 separate times over the month I was in Greece because I was able to relax and actually slow down. The spaces are beautiful and creative too. Athina is wonderful and so helpful and accommodating. She’s easily he best host I’ve ever dealt with. Highly recommend her!"

It’s also a close walking distance to the Acropolis and Plaka. We love every space in the house, we wish it was ours! (Especially the bedroom!) Athina was easy to communicate with and she attended to our every needs. Her place is probably the best accommodation we’ve had in our 10 months of travel. We would definitely choose to stay here again if we come back to Athens. Thank again Athina! You’re an amazing host!"
14208866,216711527,2017-12-05,157436675,Joanne,"We could not have asked for anything better than Athina’s place. It was so central, within walking distance to the Acropolis and yet far enough to be away from the tourist centre. We had the pleasure of dining in authentic local restaurants and enjoyed walking along the streets that were lined with orange trees laden with fruit. So beautiful. <br/><br/>The apartment itself was lovely. So well kept, arty and comfortable. The balcony was a real plus. It was nice sitting outside with a cup of coffee enjoy the quiet. All in all a great stay. Highly recommended."

Eravamo 3 donne e 1 bambina, e non ci siamo mai sentite in pericolo!<br/>Nell’appartamento c’è di tutto: aria condizionata, asciugamani, phon, saponi e dentifricio, colazione con macchina del caffè Nescafè (cialde incluse), tisane, marmellate, biscotti...e di fronte c’è un supermercato, nel caso la colazione inclusa non fosse sufficiente!! :)<br/>Ideale per massimo 2 adulti e 2 bambini, con il divano letto montato infatti si perde un bel po’ di spazio in soggiorno.<br/>Athina è super disponibile: ci ha prenotato il taxi sia per l’andata che per il ritorno (la corsa costa 40€), e ci ha procurato anche del cibo senza glutine su nostra richiesta!<br/>Tantissimi dettagli che rendono l’alloggio caldo e unico!!<br/>Consigliatissimo!!!!"

Easy walking to Plaka area and acropolis. Very much recommended."

14208866,228518187,2018-01-20,110097772,Stephanie,Athina is a wonderful host and the space is not only adorable but in the central part of Athens. We never used the Metro and just walked everywhere. Can’t recommend the place enough. 
14208866,229392314,2018-01-23,157803782,Carla,"The place was just like in photos and as described. With my kid it took us 15 minutes to Acropolis. There were a lot of restaurants and shops near by inclusing mini markets...We never got on the bus/ not once, we walked all over, even to the Olympic stadium panathenaic...with my 8 year old. The place is quiet, no noise and very clean. Clean apartment building. It  has everything you need to cook, sleep, eat and relax (Website hidden by Airbnb) kid loved channels 34 and 37 which are kids channels/she also liked the bread and nuttela for breakfast. Athina left us a lot of teas, coffees, eggs, water, butter and jams plus candies. In the shower she left shampoo, conditioner,soaps, q-tips and toilet paper. The washer machine came in handy the last day/there was detergent and softener too. We never got to enjoy the balcony since we did not have time and were gone most days but it was clean, neat and cute.  Clean host, she explained everything the day we met/ recommended restaurants and greek snack bars."
14208866,231860770,2018-02-03,34689346,Lutye,"All that I hoped and more, staying at Athina's place. She was, and her place. The apartment charming, clean, private, comfortable. The corner wing back chair to read. The balcony off living area, and the bedroom, for a coffee. A safe and smart lift...or, four flights of stairs. Location of delightful place, perfect. Any direction. Easy, easy walk. Acropolis in  minutes. Bakeries, coffee shops, places to eat, so near. Grocery mart across the street. A safe neighborhood. Lovely and sweet tailors, two doors away, my on the road repair need. They were fabulous. The host, Athina, so good in communications and exceptional kindnesses. Washing machine provided. TV. There if needed, or the world of Athens outside the door."
14208866,234286302,2018-02-12,167062856,Eva,"To those looking for a good spot to stay in Athens, whether alone or as a couple, Athina's flat is well situated in a safe and fairly quiet neighbourhood only 15 minutes walk away from the Acropolis. With the closest metro station (Syntagma) being only 5 minutes away, there's no excuse not to get out and explore! I would suggest trying the 'Baking Room' up the road for good breakfast snacks and the 'Balcony' a little further up for an amazing rooftop meal. Happy traveling!"
14208866,235882646,2018-02-18,17395,Zoë,"Athina's place is lovely and cozy and importantly for me, very quiet! The location is fantastic for the Acropolis museum (10 mins walk) as well as for the contemporary art museum (5 mins) and great for bars, restaurants and bakeries too. Athina very kindly and thoughtfully provides all the basics such as coffee, sugar, washing up liquid etc which is just great, especially for short breaks. Her kitchen is very well equipped too with a kettle, pots and pans, kitchen paper and so on. There are many items in the appartment and I did find myself having to put things on higher shelves so that my curious toddler wouldn't take everything in his hands. Athina provided everything I needed for him too - cot, towel, flannel and even soft toys :) The appartment was also spotlessly clean. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend to anyone visiting Athens!"

Host was late preparing the room for us, but was friendly and kind."

We especially liked being able to easily walk to Filopappos Hill with its amazing views of the Acropolis and the city, especially at sunset.  The walk to the Acropolis and Monastiraki is also not difficult.  Although it is located on a well travelled street, the apartment is quiet, cozy and comfortable with a very pleasant balcony.  Pedestrian streets with good cafes and restaurants are very nearby.  Athina thoughtfully leaves some basic groceries along with tea and coffee, and the kitchen is well equipped. She also very kindly allowed us to leave our bags after check out so that we could enjoy walking in Athens on our last day."

Small market just in front to buy food. Many restaurants near by. Athina was a great host , always answering our questions very quick. She booked us a taxi for airport pic up an to tour the city. I recommend!"
14208866,278880937,2018-06-19,193051841,Prasad,"Athina's place was really nice. Clean, with lot of artistic touches. All amenities working satisfactorily.  Reasonably close to Acropolis.<br/><br/>Our only issue was not being reachable at arrival and the consequent wait to dump our luggage. Rest all fine."
14208866,282357273,2018-06-27,127464728,Daniel,"Athena’s place is delightful. She was so hospitable, gave us great recommendations, arranged for taxis, and even provided a light breakfast of fruits and eggs. The location of her place was ideal for anyone visiting the Acropolis. We highly recommend. "

Near the Acropolis and near pedestrian strips full of shops and great eats. Athina is lovely and such a wonderful and accommodating host. Although public transportation is accessible, Athina helped us arrange for cabs late at night and early in the morning. Thank you so much for everything!"
14208866,288151883,2018-07-09,27888598,Sabine,"I stayed at Athina’s place with a friend, attending a conference in Athens. We both loved the neighbourhood and that Athina’s place was quiet, with a lovely balcony and air conditioning in the bedroom and living room. The apartment is small and quirky. As the bedroom door can be closed towards the living room (with the sofa bed), it is suitable for two adults who don’t want to share the double bed. We found everything we needed in the apartment and Athina was very easy to communicate and very helpful with organising us a taxi from the airport even when my flight got unexpectedly cancelled. Thank you for your excellent hospitality."
14208866,292056151,2018-07-17,202072368,Marianne,Veldig hyggelig og litt kitchy sted 10 minutters gange fra Akropolis. Kort å gå opp til Filapappos hill da det er rett bak leiligheten. Vi var en familie på 4 og det fungerte bra selv om leiligheten ikke er så stor.  Fikk veldig raskt svar på våre henvendelser og hun var veldig behjelpelig.

Tiene una muy linda decoración y cuenta con todo lo necesario para una agradable estadía. Nosotros fuimos una familia de 4 personas y a pesar de que el departamento luce pequeño fue muy cómodo para todo a nosotros. El sofá cama es mucho más cómodo de lo que podríamos haber esperado. Cuenta con aire acondicionado tanto en la sala como en el dormitorio principal, además de tener todo lo necesario para cocinar desayunos, almuerzos. Incluso Athina nos dejó frutas, bebidas y demás cosas para poder cocinar y comer.<br/>La ubicación es excelente, te permite ir caminando a los principales lugares de Atenas y el barrio es muy tranquilo. Al llegar Athina nos recibió muy amablemente y nos explicó dónde estaban los principales lugares de interés en la ciudad y como llegar, ademas nos entregó unos folletos y guías que nos permitieron movilizarnos tranquilamente. Además de eso estuvo siempre atenta a cualquier duda o inconveniente que tuviésemos durante nuestra estadía. Nos respondía muy rápido y nos ayudó siempre.<br/>Definitivamente un excelente lugar para quedarse mientras se visita Atenas y Athina una gran host!"

The balcony is incredible, so warm and inviting you won't want to leave it.  Wish I had more time to enjoy the space (only 1 night). The location is fantastic as it's only about 10mins to the acropolis.<br/><br/>When I arrived there were cookies in a plate for me to enjoy and melba toast with hazelnut spread + wine, water and fruit is the fridge.  Great touch, my tummy was very happy!<br/><br/>Athina was so quick to respond to my messages felt like only seconds.  I travelled alone and was nervous because I arrived in the evening but she reassured me the entire time. <br/>She also met me outside the metro and walked me to the apartment so that I was comfortable...truly truly appreciated gesture. <br/><br/>Overall great experience."

Es ist gemütlich und gut ausgestattet und man hat eigentlich alles, was man braucht. Athina hat uns sehr freundlich begrüßt und uns eine Karte gegeben und alles wichtige darauf markiert. Wir konnten die Stadt von dem Apartment aus zu Fuß erkunden. Sie liegt so zentral, dass man alles in der Nähe hat, was man braucht. Das Frühstück, was inbegriffen ist, war super jedoch nicht sehr vielfältig und für 2 Personen etwas wenig. Was nicht schlimm war, denn gegenüber gab es einen Supermarkt, in dem wir uns alles kaufen konnten. Ich empfehle auf den süßen Balkon in der Sonne zu frühstücken. <br/>Ich kann dieses Apartment nur empfehlen und wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Danke Athina :)"

We arrived before our check-in time so she stored our bags in our room for us so we could stroll the city. When we did “check-in” a few hours later she gave us some insight on local spots with the best food and they were all amazing and well priced. The space was quaint and well decorated, perfect for 3 adults or two adults and two kids. Has everything you need. 10 minute walk to the main sights, sort of in a busy area, so may be a bit loud if you have young children. Right next to at least 10 restaurants, eat at them!"
14208866,437717318,2019-04-15,11669221,Mary,"Do not hesitate to book this awesome spot! The apartment is in an amazing location, just down the hill from all the action and sights but in a more authentic and low-key neighborhood. From this place, you can have it all without the crazy crowds of the tourist district but everything is close by if you want an easy trip to the Acropolis, restaurants, and other tourist amenities. Right on the street are some incredible cafes and Athina has great recommendations too. The apartment is also fully equipped (and adorable!) for a long term stay with cooking and living space. The balcony is the best little spot. The apartment was silent and pitch black at night, quite a change for a big city! Athina was also very kind and helpful without being overbearing. Communication was quick and constant. Book this place!"

She deserves a pat on her back for this one!!<br/><br/>People, Take good care of your belongings, this city has its perils given its financial struggles! Cheers"
14208866,441622003,2019-04-22,58276815,Prateek,"Athina's apartment is lovely and very artisticly decorated. It is as shown in the pictures. We are glad that we chose to stay here for our 3 nights stay at Athens. There is a supermarket right in front of apartment, all the amenities like ATM, bakery, cafe and restaurants are within 1-5min walk. Even the archeological sites and museums are walkable distance, we covered all places by foot. <br/><br/>Athina is a great host. She guided us to reach the apartment waiting for our arrival. Recommended Greek dishes and restaurants. She chalked out a 2 day complete itinerary for us. Thank you for being kind and helpful. Apologies in case we let you down as guests."
14208866,445914519,2019-04-30,92349779,Andreea,"Athina’s apartment is beautifully decorated, with a very nice terrace on which you can have breakfast or drink something in the evening. The location is perfect - very close to Acropolis and main attractions, in a nice and safe neighborhood.<br/>The apartment was very clean. The communication with Athina was very good, she’s very prompt and she gave us useful advice.<br/>She even left us some food, fruits and traditional Easter food.<br/>I gladly recommend to stay in her apartment, it’s totally worth it."
14208866,449642350,2019-05-07,15023112,Emile,"Perfect little place for a short or long stay in Athens. The apartment is clean, very quiet (it looks out onto a central courtyard, not the road), and is full of amenities. The balcony was a lovely place to have breakfast. We travelled there with our 8-month old son, so we can  safely say that the flat is well equipped for babies too! The neighbourhood - Koukaki - was surprisingly nice. Lots of delicious restaurants nearby, loads of small shops, a very residential feel. It's also a short walk from the main sites and the metro. It's hard to think of a better place you could stay in Athens, not least because Athina herself is so helpful and responsive. Overall, a first-rate Airbnb experience!"
14208866,450697277,2019-05-10,63089376,Kate,"What a hidden gem in the middle of Athens!! Athina was so warm and welcoming when we met her and she gave us excellent tips on where to go, how best to get around, and what to see! Her place is so cute and stylishly decorated (we especially loved the balcony - the perfect place to enjoy a quiet bottle of wine after a day full of sightseeing!). There were plenty of goodies in the kitchen to tide us over until meals, plus pretty much anything else you could think of (long live the corkscrew!). As my friend and I switched off on sleeping arrangements, I can fully testify that both the bed and the sleeper couch are wonderfully comfy. The shower is a bit tricky to navigate if you're not used to a hand-held ""wired"" showerhead - if you need two hands to wash your hair like I do, it's possible to prop the showerhead against the shampoo bottles so you can shower hands-free, but it takes some wrangling/knotting of the shower cord to do so. Just know it IS possible (but make sure to get the shower curtain fully closed so you don't get water everywhere). <br/><br/>Importantly: you can do LAUNDRY here! What a godsend after ~10 days on the road!! (We were starting to smell quite a bit.) There is a washing machine, detergent, and fabric softener available for use which was a much appreciated touch. Again - wonderful hospitality here! Also of note: the neighborhood surrounding Athina's place is awesome - she recommended some great spots for food, which proved to be fabulous. We were so happy here! We'll absolutely return on our next foray through Athens. Ευχαριστώ Athina!"
14208866,452391929,2019-05-13,94351225,Melissa,Very responsive and friendly host. Nice and homely place to stay in.

14208866,456251966,2019-05-21,13209666,Michael,"I had a very enjoyable tonight's today. Athina was waiting to greet me a check in and explained everything very well. Her place is in a fine location in Koukaki, which is a very pleasant neighborhood with plenty of food and service offerings nearby. The apartment is small, but it's tastefully furnished and feels quite comfortable.  The amenities were also fine, although for me, the bed mattress was rather soft and springy.  Still, I had a very enjoyable stay and would certainly not hesitate to recommend it to others."
14208866,457860848,2019-05-25,20739433,Janet,Our apartment neighbourhood was authentic and neighborly. We really enjoyed the atmosphere. The apartment also was sparkling clean and beautifully decorated. The fridge was filled with breakfast food and fruit of all kinds. A generous host for sure.

14208866,462437965,2019-06-02,52463595,Amy,Athina’s place was charming and comfortable. She provided us with great local recommendations and advice. We loved the neighborhood and found ourselves missing it when we moved to a hotel in the city center for the remainder of our time in Athens. Definitely recommend staying here for a more authentic Athens experience.
14208866,465094391,2019-06-07,37093877,Tala,"Great host! Wonderful location and the apt was spotless. Very thoughtful breakfast was also in the fridge waiting for us. We truly enjoyed our stay. There was also a washer, which was great. No complaints at all!"
14208866,467361847,2019-06-10,64576089,Yancy,"One of the best Airbnb options for Athens. It’s great for a family of four. Athina is an amazing  host and communicated promptly every time I had a question. She also helped us booked transfers from/to airport and port and the taxi drivers were very punctual, courteous and helpful. <br/>Athina’s place has so many details that no other Airbnb has had. Everything you might need it’s there. She left a basket with food, delicious fruit in the fridge, eggs and everything to make breakfast. There was even wine to relax in the evening. The place is super eclectic, cozy and cute. Another plus is LOCATON!!! It’s 10 minutes walking to Acropolis museum, Syntagma, Plaka, etc.<br/>She also recommended delicious restaurants in the area. We were looking for local flavor and atmosphere and we got it (only a couple of blocks from the apartment). Also, there is a supermarket right across the street. <br/>We couldn’t have asked for more. Thank you, Athina! Our time in Athens was wonderful with all your help! "

14208866,478522603,2019-06-30,5504763,Margaret,Athina's place was a welcome retreat following days of travel and walking around Athens.  It was a charming space in a safe and convenient local neighborhood.  Athina was very helpful in answering questions and giving useful suggestions.  It was so nice to have some basic food items for the morning and be able to relax and make breakfast.  The metro is within walking distance and there are some good restaurants/cafes in this area.  We would highly recommend Athina's place.
14208866,482892852,2019-07-07,82222649,Nataya,It was amazing! Athina is so thoughtful and welcoming. Our flight was delayed and she was still there for our checking 3 hours later. She has everything you could need while staying there even the little things you usually forget and she even stocked the kitchen for us! Absolutely wouldn’t hesitate to book again! Thanks for everything Athina ☺️
14208866,484611611,2019-07-09,246987078,Céline,"Nous avons passé 2 nuits dans l'appartement d'Athina. 2 adultes et 2 enfants. Ces derniers dormaient dans le canapé lit du salon. La décoration est top, on a vraiment l'impression d'être chez soi. Le balcon bien isolé des regards donnait sur une petite cour à l'abri. C'est calme. Athina met à disposition beaucoup d'équipements ainsi que des produits alimentaires de base. Il y a même de quoi faire son petit déjeuner. La location est située dans un quartier tranquille avec un petit supermarché juste en face et des restaurants à proximité. On n'est qu'à 10-15 minutes des principales attractions d'Athènes. Athina est très accueillante et saura vous conseiller pour vous déplacer ou vous restaurer. Vraiment un bon plan !"
14208866,485658405,2019-07-11,52475593,Bertrand,"Venu pour 2 nuits à Athènes avec mes deux filles, Athina nous a accueilli très chaleureusement. Le logement est parfaitement situé à deux pas de restaurants très bons et le quartier est agréable avec tout les commerces de proximité nécessaires. La climatisation du logement fut très efficace et appréciable alors même qu'il faisait 37 degrés à l'extérieur. Beaucoup de petites attentions au sein de l'appartement qui facilitent l'installation. L'appartement est très bien aménagé et très propre. Nous n'avons manqué de rien. Je suis très content d'avoir séjourné dans cet appartement."
14208866,489160100,2019-07-16,45436588,Sophie,Situation parfaite du logement d'Athina pour visiter Athènes à pieds. Accueil très bien ; organisation irreprochable (réservations taxis). <br/>Certes le logement est gorgé de meubles à la mode suédoise (enseigne jaune et bleue) et la mondialisation nous prive des petites touches locales typiques ... nous finissons par retrouver les mêmes accessoires et meubles bon marché et plus ou moins jolis un peu partout sur la planète ... dommage... mais ceci mis à part c'est un excellent point de chute. Je recommande +++.
14208866,490227835,2019-07-18,8757291,Christa,Athina was very helpful and left food in the fridge for breakfast which was fantastic! She was quick to respond to questions. Her place has a really nice balcony and has a lot of charm.

Appena fuori dalla confusione dei turisti a voce alta. Bello, divertente, colorato, in un quartiere con una sua sobria eleganza....Athina è poi, la padrona di casa che non ti aspetti, gentile e generosa. Grazie"

The apartment is very nice and comfortable and located very near the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum. And it isn't noisy at all. The balcony is a nice touch. We were also very pleasantly surprised that pretty much everything we needed was already provided in the apartment (such as food, tooth paste, shampoo and so on). <br/>Athina also gave us a lot of helpful tips as to how to get around the city or where we could find good spots to eat.

All room were thoughtfully decorated and were the right size for a couple. The apartment will fill a maximum of 3 adults and anything more would be a bit of a squeeze<br/>Check in/out : Athina was there to receive us for check-in (at around 7pm) and we used a keybox located at the entrance of the building for check-out. <br/>Location: The apartment is located is definitely withing 10' of walking distance from the Acropolis and has a number of nice pedestrian passageways and restaurants/bars close by. There is a supermarket/pharmacy located right opposite the building for any emergency needs. The building that the apartment is located in is also secure so there's no cause for concern at all. <br/>Other: Athina had filled up the pantry with all our breakfast needs for 4 days. We had milk, bread, cereal, honey, tea, coffee, cheese and some basic condiments in case one feels like cooking. She's also super friendly and was very responsive to any requests. <br/>It was a great stay and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Athens!"

I can really see the efforts she made to create a cozy place. Great value for a great price. We had a pleasant time and would choose to come again."

14208866,612794170,2020-03-01,551701,Benji,Athina is very hospitable. Her place is nice and cosy. The location is also very good. Really close to the center and in a neigbourhood with lots of resto's and bars.  Perfect to visit and explore Athens!
14208866,616606924,2020-03-10,35267134,Olivia,"Athina was a wonderful host and her apartment was so lovely! Really cosy and comfortable, with everything you could possibly need.<br/><br/>Athina met me at the apartment for check-in and she was very kind and friendly; she showed me everything I needed to know and made me feel at home. <br/><br/>It was great to have some basic food items already there, too! That was such a lovely touch. Not all the items mentioned in the listing were available, but what was there was still great and much more than what you get at most Airbnbs."

Good for public transport, 5 mins to metro and bus stops right outside.<br/>Loads of bars and cafes with a market directly across the road.<br/>A beautiful flat with everything you will ever need and lots of quirky furnishings.

14208866,642213645,2020-07-25,53836887,Magda,"Pros: Cozy apartment with a nice balcony full of flowers, well equipped kitchen, helpful host.<br/>Cons: No laptop-friendly space, daytime noise due to constructions."
14208866,651807758,2020-08-16,198281840,Matthew,This place was perfect for my type of stay. Located in the centre of Athens walking distance from every site I wanted to visit. The size of the apartment was larger than I initially thought and I didn't even use the balcony during my stay. There was AC in both the bedroom and living room when coming back from a day of walking in the sun and the kitchen was packed with equipment allowing me the option to cook if needed.
14208866,654579889,2020-08-22,52596068,Jude,Great host and great location
14208866,657215081,2020-08-28,154426508,Alice,"Athina’s place is lovely. She was a very good host who was great at answering questions. The place has everything. She leaves jams and butter and eggs, cereal etc. There was also all crockery you’d need and toasters and coffee makers. The flat was also very cutely decorated and had a lovely balcony. There was air con in the bedroom and sitting room which was amazing as it was so hot. You also have access to a washing machine and all detergent. Thanks for everything Athena you were great"
14208866,662031578,2020-09-08,328889040,Manon,"The appartment was perfect for everything, the location, the cleanliness, the attention to the details... I personally love the decoration. <br/>The little snacks were very helpful, it's always nice to arrive in a non-empty place, even more after a long journey. <br/>We highly recommend the place and Athina as a host. <br/>She is very helpful, professional and kind."
14208866,663539728,2020-09-13,33210890,Anna,Just perfect! Nice location close to the metro and everything you need. A supermarket in front of the house. Very clean and comfy place. We felt like home!

14208866,668313403,2020-09-27,3623545,Zoe,"As described by previous reviewers, the apartment is very well - appointed, with lots of nice touches upon arrival including snacks, breakfast options, etc. Athina was very mindful of the current situation, too, providing sanitiser and masks in case of need. Air conditioning worked well, apartment is quiet, balcony is a great extra space to enjoy.<br/><br/>By staying here we also discovered a part of town which we would not otherwise have visited; Koukaki had a really nice vibe. And with buses / metro, we never felt far from any part of town."
14208866,671781119,2020-10-06,103733123,Monika,"Stayed for 6 nights and I have to say if I ever come back i will choose Athina’s place again. It must be the most charming airbnb I have ever stayed in, especially the cute balcony to enjoy coffee and breakfast. Has all the amenities, location was perfect and host very responsive."
14208866,701399892,2020-10-18,324327335,Anthony,Appartement sympa avec balcon idéal pour le petit déjeuner. Athina nous a fourni le petit déjeuné et les produits alimentaires de base (ainsi que gel hydro-alcoolique ). Les transports sont à proximité et beaucoup de lieu touristique sont accessibles à pieds.

Decorated with a burst of colour & offers an extremely beautiful patio filled with plants, her place is one of a kind! You have tons of cafes and restaurants at a mere walking distance. All major landmarks are a lovely stroll away and Athina’s attention to detail makes you feel like you’re home away from home. I’m already missing her lovely home but forever grateful to have been able to stay in this gem! <br/><br/>Athens has a special place in my heart, thanks to Athina!"
14208866,704797231,2020-10-29,53837559,Maurann,"Lovely place in a really sweet neighborhood! The apartment is a bit smaller than what we excpected, and the matress is actually 2 matresses which made it a bit difficult to sleep (especially for couples). But overall we had a great time there, and Athina was very responsive and helpful."

14208866,747322313,2021-04-10,83469042,Katharina,"Athina’s place is exactly as pictured- stylish, beautiful and cosy. We especially loved the balcony! The flat is in an excellent location- close to the metro and many touristic sights in a vibrant neighborhood with cool bars, nice cafes and little shops. The flat is quiet despite the central location thanks to facing the courtyard. Kitchen is fully equipped and both kitchen and bathroom have windows for ventilation. The flat was very clean and in excellent condition. Wifi worked very well throughout the flat. Athina is an extremely generous host who provided not only food and drinks, but also masks and hand sanitizers. She offers contactless check-in and check-out during the ongoing pandemic, but was easily accessible and replied very promptly to messages. I highly recommend this place and hope to come back!"
14208866,751787795,2021-04-25,5136751,Evgeniia,We are delighted with this apartment a lot! Every detail has carefully been considered. we felt as if we had come to visit where they were waiting for us with great joy and impatience! The apartment is ideal for two two people.

14208866,763589760,2021-05-29,2552637,Chloe,"Superbe petit appartement richement décoré et très bien agencé. La terrasse est un vrai plus et donne sur l'arrière donc on y est au calme. Athina avait prévu de quoi se désinfecter les mains ainsi que des masques et des petites bouteilles de gel hydroalcoolique. L'appartement est situé dans un super chouette quartier, en face d'un petit supermarché ce qui est très pratique et entre deux rues pleines de très bons restos. Le métro n'est pas loin et on peut se rendre dans le centre à pied. Un superbe séjour dans cet appartement, nous recommandons."
14208866,766847572,2021-06-06,254433476,Claire,"This is an amazing place. Quiet and close to all the major attractions that you will be frequenting during your time in Athens. She is a great host and helped with all our questions. We had to unexpectedly cancel the last two nights of our stay, and she was gracious in refunding the amount and even helping us book a taxi. Kitchen has everything you might need for cooking. Many thoughtful touches all around the apartment."
14208866,391752503676239294,2021-06-24,248666848,Anna,"This is absolutely wonderful, bright, cozy apartment with everything you may need, including small things you won’t need to buy: water, some food, stuff in kitchen and bathroom. Nice balcony that would make you chill on it even if it’s too hot outside. Athina was very flexible, spent some time to solve some our logistics issues."

14208866,403304482087571455,2021-07-10,39203822,Wendy,"Athina’s place is in a very nice neighborhood and is in a very convenient location. There is a supermarket right across the street, and a few cafes nearby. There are also some very nice cafes, restaurants and bakery nearby. <br/>The unit itself is homey and cozy, good enough for two people, the balcony is lovely and nicely decorated.<br/>Athina is responsive to my questions and is very kind and patient, and we are so grateful that Athina is accepting our pets. <br/>We will definitely come back to Athina’s apartment unit when we go to Athens again."
14208866,404828608927156381,2021-07-12,862023,Melissa,"This is one of our favorite airbnb experiences to date. Athina's place is so cute and cozy. The black out blinds make for a wonderful jet lag transition. Athina had everything we needed including some breakfast items and stuff for our toddler. Plus this place was close to all the good spots to eat, drink, and enjoy coffee. Thank you, Athina!"
14208866,408463868968624964,2021-07-17,124154829,Rachael,"We could not have dreamed of a better time in Athens! This airbnb was close to everything, close to the metro, and had the most amazing food just around the corner. <br/>Our host was phenomenal at helping us with our taxi for our early morning flight and responding quickly to us. Check-in was a breeze. This was the best place to come back to in the heat of the day or at night before adventuring the next day. <br/>There was something for the morning to have before starting your adventures into the city, which was an especially nice touch. Thank you!"

14208866,418591369332359037,2021-07-31,153286908,Grace,Gorgeous little apartment! So many restaurants and cafes nearby. Athina was a lovely host with great communication.
14208866,422132638928566638,2021-08-05,415668842,Georgios,"Everything was as positive as I expected after reading the other reviews. The apartment is very comfortable, clean and quiet (although the was a dog in the neighbourhood who occasionally barked like crazy), it's not too far away from the next metro station and from the centre, and Athina answered all my questions quickly and satisfactorily. What I didn't like is that only sugar was being offered in the kitchen and that the eggs in the refrigerator were from eggs raised in cages. I will definitely reconsider choosing Athina's apartment for my next stay in Athens."
14208866,425762792717363768,2021-08-10,5075406,Brittany,"My husband and I had a fantastic stay. Possibly our best ever Airbnb experience to date! The apartment was spotless and the decor was happy and inviting, we truly felt like we were at home. The free coffee, tea, fruit basket and other snacks were an especially memorable touch that made us feel very cared for. Having a supermarket directly out the front door of the apartment was very convenient and during our 5 day stay we were able to walk everywhere we went! Some of our favorite places nearby include Tuk Tuk Thai and Django for gelato. The WiFi was good and the air conditioning was a life saver. Thank you for everything Athina! We would be more than happy to stay here again in the future."

Man entdeckte immer wieder neues in der deko.. und trotzdem fand man Platz seine eigenen Dinge zu verstauen. Kleine, aber feine Küche mit vielen Utensilien. Waschmaschine und eigentlich alles was man so brauchen könnte, war vorhanden.Wir schliefen mitten im Zentrum,Akropolis etc fußläufig zu erreichen , und trotzdem sehr leise. Zum Frühstück stellte Athina ein paar Zutaten in die Küche,zum ergänzen ein Supermarkt direkt (Website hidden by Airbnb) direkter Nähe gab's allerdings auch ein paar  kleine Cafés  für ein Frühstück. Athina organisierte zwei Taxi- Shuttles perfekt und auf die Minute genau. Wir würden immer wieder dieses appartement wählen, wenn wir noch mal nach Athen kommen"

The location can’t be beat-there is a grocery store and electronics place across the street, bakery next door, pharmacy on the corner and lots of bars/cafes and restaurants near by. I most appreciated that it is close to the tourist areas without being in them so you get conscience and feel like your living like a local."
14208866,451202400900307924,2021-09-14,24711856,Vicki,Really cute efficient space with absolutely everything you need.  Athena is attentive.  We couldn’t have been happier in our choice.

14208866,473695348084861216,2021-10-15,145416522,Velica,"Great and cozy apartment, close to everything, we were able to walk to Akropolis all the way to Monastiraki. We had a great time even we had some issues finding how to flush the toilet, we could not see a thank and the button to flush, had to contact Athina and advised to pull a chain from the roof. We were thinking it was decoration so we we’re afraid to pull and cause a disaster! My advise about the shower, is placed in a different way than America, so we had issues were the curtain stick to our body while showering and the water filter out of the curtain and ended on the floor, but that is something could be fixed with a heavier shower curtain probably.  The faucet is placed on the side of tub which makes a little bit difficult while showering i got hurt my leg while trying to maneuver the issue with the curtain sticking to my body. After all we had a great time and recommend the place."

L'appartement est au coeur de la Plaka mais au calme et la terrasse offre une belle vue sur l'Acropole. Au pied de l'immeuble se trouvent un petit supermarché et une boulangerie, ainsi que la petite place ombragée de Sotiros et son restaurant familial le Saita où nous avons vite pris nos habitudes !  Christina s'est montrée très accueillante et a eu la patience de nous attendre car nous sommes arrivés plus tard que prévu. Nous recommandons chaudement cet endroit paisible et prévoyons d'y retourner. <br/>Nb :  Christina a vécu en France et parle un français impeccable !"

L'emplacement est idéal, au coeur de la Plaka mais dans une rue très calme donc aucun problème de nuisance sonore. La terrasse avec vue sur l'Acropole est tout simplement époustouflante. Christina est très sympathique et francophone, elle vous donne les 1ers conseils (transport en communs, visites, restaurant, commerces...) et si vous souhaitez aller plus loin dans les discussions ... elle est également disponible. Très bon choix pour passer un séjour dans le coeur historique d'Athènes."

Apartment was clean and ready for our visit. She even filled up the fridge for us! I highly recommend this authentic apartment in the heart of the city. If you're looking for ""a breakfast with a view"", Christina's balcony is amazing for an outstanding view of the acropolis. Thanks again, Christina! "
14232632,169860205,2017-07-14,43161775,Isabelle,L'accueil et la disponibilité de Chrisina sont appréciables. Ses conseils sur le quartier et sur la taverne toute proche nous ont été très précieux.

14232632,451859411,2019-05-12,19574475,Chiara,"Christina is probably the most welcoming Airbnb host I have ever encountered. She was very accommodating with check-in and check-out times and she met us to show us around the flat and at the end of our stay to ensure everything had gone smoothly. She had kindly stocked up the fridge for us, and we greatly enjoyed our breakfast on the veranda with a stunning view of the Acropolis. The location is perfect to get to the airport by metro, as well as to most of the touristic sites on foot. Cannot recommend this place enough!"

Note to light sleepers thinking of staying over the weekend: there is a bar downstairs and could get slightly loud at night."
14247182,109117710,2016-10-19,2369941,Nicholas,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the apartment and the location.  Comfortable and cozy, the apartment had everything we needed for a week in Plaka neighborhood, offering a perfect home base to explore the area's history and night life.  Tucked away behind a trendy neighborhood, the location is quiet enough to be restful while being a 2 minute walk to a vivid night life."

Μπορεί κανείς να κινηθεί για ψώνια, καφέ και βόλτα στο κέντρο της Αθήνας χωρίς την χρήση αστικών (Website hidden by Airbnb) διαμέρισμα ανταποκρίνεται σε αυτό που δείχνουν οι φωτογραφίες.. Υπάρχει ωστόσο ακριβώς από κάτω ένα καφε-μπαρ που πιθανόν να είναι ενοχλητικό λόγω θορύβου ιδιαίτερα τους καλοκαιρινούς μήνες"
14247182,111995274,2016-11-03,86178440,Jonathan,Great studio in the heart of the Plaka where we experienced more locals but we're close to tourist attractions as well. Our host was very helpful and good with communication. The room was small but just what my wife and I needed with a small kitchen which we didn't use much because we ate out the whole visit. There's a cafe downstairs from the studio which gets noisy during the night until 2 AM and kept us up a bit but for the location and price you can't beat it! I would stay there again and highly recommend it! 
14247182,112988380,2016-11-09,95197662,Diane,"This apartment is perfect for those wanting to experience Athens nightlife and pleasant walks  to the historic sights.  A very lively bar is right below it and many nice restaurants, taverns and cafes are within a couple of blocks. It is also close to the metro and buses. We caught a tram which took us to Athens beaches. If you are looking for peace and quiet though, this place is probably not for you."

Hot water heater and electricity would go out often due to old electrical wiring in the space. Once inside the space I noticed all the soap and shampoo had been used and all the old bottles were just still sitting there so I went out and bought my own essentials.Also was only given 1 full sized towel and 1 hand towel upon arrival so had to request an extra since there weren't any extras in the space. Additionally, the space is above a very very noisy bar so it got quite loud at night. George and Eben were helpful with my issues and gave me some good tips on things to do in Athens. I would probably not stay here again but if you are on a budget and want a good location I would definitely recommend it!"

The only thing is the hot water in the shower doesn't last very long and the apartment is right on top of a bar/restaurant, so some nights it's noisy until around 2am. That wasn't that awful for us but is good to keep in mind."

Το σπίτι αρκετά περιποιημένο όπως ακριβώς φαίνεται στις φωτογραφίες. Το μόνο αρνητικό ήταν ότι τα υδραυλικα είναι λίγο παλιά. Πολύ καλή σχέση ποιότητας τιμής. Το συνιστώ

Situated just outside of the Plaka and monasteraki market it is on a small cobble stone street scattered with cafes, restaurants, bars and studios.  Very hip and arty vibed neighbourhood with an easily accessible location to all amenities!"

I stayed for 3 nights and it was the perfect location to explore the city. I arrived in the neighborhood very late my first night and was sort of nervous about getting from the metro station to the apartment (solo woman traveler) but it's a very lively area and I had nothing to worry about for the entirety of my stay. <br/><br/>It is worth noting that the flat is directly above the Cafe, so it can be loud at night. Just bring ear plugs! <br/><br/>George was a very accommodating and very easy to communicate with. I actually can't recommend this place enough! I'll be back, for sure."

Ganz in der Nähe findet man unzählige Cafés und Restaurants, Geschäfte und grüne Parks. Die Lage in dieser geschäftigen und lebendigen Umgebung führt natürlich dazu, dass es in der Nacht nicht wirklich ruhig ist, gleich unter dem Fenster befindet sich zum Beispiel auch ein Café. Als Alleinreisende fand ich die aber Lage perfekt und wenn man die Fenster schliesst und dafür die Air Condition anschaltet schläft man bestens."

La climatisation est très appréciable dans la chaleur de l'été à Athènes. On entend tout de même le bruit de la rue (terrasse de café) le soir, ce qui peut être gênant pour dormir. Idéal pour un court séjour."

A bit of noise from the downstairs bar is really not a big deal, you'll sleep comfortably here. Communication from the host needs a bit of improvement and the house is pretty basic and it would really benefit from a small renovation, especially in the bathroom. All in all a good experience and you should consider visiting George's place if you need something in Thisio!"

La zona es muy linda y tranquila, y a pesar de que tiene un bar debajo, no hacen disturbios ni ruidos.

14247182,207840232,2017-10-30,121351910,Emmanuelle,"Un appartement idéalement situé pour découvrir Athènes à pied, une proximité du métro pour des expéditions plus lointaines (comme Delphes ou Le Piree). Un appartement qui convient plutôt aux personnes souhaitant découvrir, aussi, la vie nocturne, de nombreux bars et restaurants se trouvant au pied de l'appartement."
14247182,208577813,2017-11-02,11424716,John,Great place located within a short walk to Acropolis. Exactly as you see. George was very responsive. Would recommend.

14247182,216859646,2017-12-06,56209499,Kenneth,"What an incredible place to stay when in Athens! In the middle of everything, wonderful location, and a great and comfortable living space. George was very accomodating and communicative before/during/after my stay and i am very grateful! Already missing Athens and my little home while I was there!"
14247182,219016665,2017-12-16,158565934,Florin Doru,Very good location.
14247182,231057307,2018-01-30,7097062,Karina,Such a great location & bed is very comfortable. Access to everything at your doorstep...would highly recommend to experience Athens this way..
14247182,235018898,2018-02-15,50996636,Richard,"A cozy little place in a great neighbourhood, short walking distance to a lot of archeological sites and tourist hotspots."
14247182,238071193,2018-02-25,21902930,Christine,"Lejligheden er i god afstand fra Akropolis og andre centralt beliggende seværdigheder, og om sommeren er den formentlig dejligt sval at bo i. I februar var den vældig kold, men George havde et ekstra varmeapparat, som afhjalp problemet. George er nem at få fat på via appen, og han gjorde det let for os at tjekke både ud og ind - han udvidede endda vores udtjeknings tidspunkt flere to timer, hvilket vi var meget taknemmelige for!<br/><br/>Billederne misrepræsenterer dog lejligheden - i virkeligheden er den langt fra lige så flot, som den ser ud på billederne. Den bærer generelt præg af at være brugt, og badeværelset er slidt. Da vi ankom, var der et stort lag støv under sengen, hvor vi ville placere nogle af vores ting, som derfor gjorde det åbenlyst. Sengen er hård, så hvis du kan lide det, er det en oplagt mulighed for dig.<br/><br/>Opsummering: Hvis du ikke regner med at bruge for meget tid i lejligheden, mens du er i Athen, kan jeg anbefale Georges lejlighed."
14247182,248706326,2018-04-01,33858048,Anurag,George’s place is very close to Acropolis. Nice. Easy. Convenient. Will recommend it.
14247182,250154907,2018-04-04,13788375,Mark,"Nice place. The location was brilliant, only a few minutes walk from the centre of town and all the big sites like the Acropolis, and close to supermarkets and restaurants. Lots of local cats to make friends with. George was lovely and let us check in early. Only downside was that the hot water takes a while to heat up, resulting in a cold shower on the first day... Once we figured out how to get around that, great place!"
14247182,251123913,2018-04-07,19563726,Amy,"Loved my stay in this apartment! It is centrally located to all of the key attractions in Athens and there are some great bars and cafes right below the apartment. I loved being able to walk up the end of the street to get an amazing night view of the Acropolis. <br/><br/>As a solo female traveller I felt safe in this neighbourhood and catching the Metro to and from the airport couldn't have been easier. You have the option to change at Thissio station but the main station Monastiraki is less than 800m away and goes directly to the airport. <br/><br/>The nightlife below is quite noisy and could be difficult if you were a light sleeper, however I had just gotten off a long flight from Australia so I had no issues sleeping for the two nights I was there :) <br/><br/>I didn't get to meet George but all of his communication was great and he was very quick at responding to my questions prior to and while I was staying here. <br/><br/>Highly recommended as a great spot to base yourself to explore Athens!"
14247182,256569338,2018-04-23,158180294,Aldona,"Great location to visit Athens, close to everything - you can actually do without public transport. A beautiful, atmospheric place.<br/>Thank you!"
14247182,257661205,2018-04-27,166733681,Rhiannon,"Amazing central location and near to everything. George is a fantastic host, I would recommend his place to anyone looking to stay in Athens. <br/>Thank you so much for letting me stay at your place George!"
14247182,260505287,2018-05-04,178382667,Steve,A basic studio apartment that is pleasant and ideal for a week stay at Athens. <br/>Great location for all amenities flea market shops bars restaurants and ideal location for visiting the sights of Athens. <br/>Nice little bar underneath the apartment run by Thanos a very friendly and helpful man.
14247182,261923595,2018-05-07,65283555,Zhang,"房子下面就是一个酒吧,第一天晚上我基本没有睡着,一直很吵到凌晨4点左右｡第二天幸好下暴雨,没有人去酒吧所以很安静｡注意,不是那种有点吵,而是无法入睡的那种!所以各位入住时请配好耳塞!<br/>其余的方面都很满意,距离景点非常近!特别方便!"
14247182,263464428,2018-05-12,51334770,Vanessa,George is a great host and his apartment is incredibly cosy. Located just above a very sweet cafe and in a wonderfully central and convenient neighbourhood. George was super responsive and quick with all my queries. He even came round especially and supplied me with an iron on my first day when I'd arrived with crumpled clothes in my suitcase. The perfect house and lovely base to get to discover Athens. I thoroughly recommend George and his charming apartment!
14247182,267565135,2018-05-22,75670644,Addie,"George’s flat is just lovely! It is in the perfect location, allowing you to explore a really neat and lively area of town. It is cozy and bright, and a great spot to come back to after a long day of walking through Athens. George was a wonderful host- very prompt with responses and helpful and kind. I would definitely stay here again! "
14247182,268872925,2018-05-26,176583667,Zachary,Picture perfect for a solo traveler with an amazing location.
14247182,270718049,2018-05-30,14703463,Rhys,"Let me first begin to say that George is a kind soul. Thank you very much for allowing me to reside in your place despite a very short stay in Athens. As this was my first time in Greece, George's apartment is located strategically in the heart of Thisseo. With a few minutes to numerous places of attraction, it makes no wonder that his apartment is highly in demand.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is very spacious, especially for a solo traveller like myself. All of the amenities were in working condition, especially with the stable wifi, air-conditioning unit as well as the heater. The bed was comfy, allowing me to have a great night sleep.<br/><br/>If there presents an opportunity to head back to Athens, I will not hesitate to rebook this place again."
14247182,270999395,2018-05-31,101842155,Andrew,"If you’re looking for an economic, close choice to see the Acropolis then this is a great choice.  My girlfriend and I stayed here one day and night on our way to Santorini to visit Athens, and it served us very well to get to the Acropolis and the surrounding area to try local food and go out in the lively neighborhood, Plaka.  This place for us would not have been enjoyable for a long stay because it’s compact size, hard mattress, and older style.  It overall depends on what you value more: affordability and proximity, or comfort."
14247182,273737203,2018-06-07,63351871,Michael,"We had a wonderful time! George was a gracious host, easy to get in touch with and available at all hours. Location took a day to get used to, but afterwards, you realize it’s in a prime location with everything available within a short walking distance. Thank you George!"
14247182,275877508,2018-06-12,28141554,Merilyn,This apartment is conveniently located near Thisios railway station ---- and it's a short walk to go restaurants and the Acropolis. It is simple accommodation. Check in was not our usual experience of Airbnb.
14247182,276290358,2018-06-13,30685778,Katia,It was perfect ! We recommend and will be back when we will be in Athens<br/>Thank you !
14247182,278470027,2018-06-18,33020553,Andrea,"The appartment is situated in a very nice part of Athens with many retaurants, bars and always a view to the acropolis. It has all you need for some days in the city.  All the sights of interest are in walking distance. Check in and check out were very easy and uncomplicated. There is a bar/cafe situated directly below the Appartment where you can sit and Enjoy a Mythos or a Cafe frappe. unfortunately, it is not completely quiet at night until the bar closes, but with ear plugs we slept very well. we would book it again! "
14247182,279549610,2018-06-21,113370925,Tom,"Small, but sparkling clean and cosy place worth choosing when you want to explore Athens by foot. It's 10 mins of nice stroll to Monastiraki and 15 to the heights of Acropolis. Moreover, you see the former from the street!<br/>George is a great host. There was not a single problem with check-in and check-out.<br/>I really recommend George's place!"
14247182,281532827,2018-06-25,17424176,Anna,Great location! Easily Walk-able to most main attractions. Apartment was fairly basic but the kitchenette was very convenient!
14247182,284087738,2018-07-01,185328910,Jan,The Apartment was good. George was kind and could answer to all questions 
14247182,286401327,2018-07-06,161485440,Josh,"The place we stayed in was lovely and situated in an ideal location, making most landmarks close by easily accessible by either walking or by the metro. We loved that we were seconds away from a small, stylish bar with very nice outdoor seating and quick service. <br/><br/>The place is ideal for couples who are staying over for a few days as it has everything you need to stay comfortable and happy. I especially liked the aircon as Athens is incredibly hot this year. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the hot water from the shower stopped working after the first night, but that wasn’t too big an issue as it was nice to cool off from walking around in the heat. Also, I would have personally liked it if there were some more pots and pans (and a multi-stove!) so that I could have been a bit more explorative with cooking. <br/><br/>Other than the above, I would highly recommend staying in George’s Airbnb if you are sightseeing around Athens - it’s ideal!"
14247182,289311155,2018-07-12,109093358,Kit,"Very nice street with very useful location right next door to the acropolis, slightly noisy from bar below but all in all a nice place to stay. I would advise you to be wary as we witnessed a robbing as a arrived in Thisseus and were followed ourselves shortly after.  But If you are careful then it’s a very nice place to stay and would highly reccomend."

14247182,300945816,2018-08-03,199887832,Maria Giovanna,"The host was polite and the location was good. However, the apartment is very squallid. In particular, the bathroom is too small and in a terrible state: visible pipes, rust on all the metal parts, infiltrations on the walls, the bathtube is stained, the water is spouting all over and it is impossible not to flood the bathroom floor. The towels are so old and stained although (hopefully) clean. The wifi did not work. The apartment does not get a lot of natural light and it is impossible to sleep before the bar downstairs closes at 3am. "
14247182,303722815,2018-08-08,68189829,Andrew,"Great value for money considering its prime location. <br/><br/>A bit on the small side and it was a bit loud at nights over the weekend as it is on top of a bar.<br/><br/>However George was a great, efficient host and we enjoyed our stay overall.<br/>"
14247182,307348978,2018-08-14,15690282,Jes,"George's place was a fantastic apartment to stay at for a quick trip to Athens!

14247182,310818299,2018-08-20,12103780,Cori,"My husband and I stayed at George’s place for 2 nights. We were pleasantly surprised at the convenience of the location. It was close to many restaurants, bars, and historical sites! We walked all over from this place! George and his assistant were both excellent and prompt communicators, even giving us restaurant recommendations. Check in and check out were a breeze as well. We highly recommended George’s place. "
14247182,312865103,2018-08-24,9160462,Emma,"Location is great, close to the train and shopping district and there’s a charming bar underneath where the owner is always keen for a chat. Communication was easy and timely. Thanks George. "
14247182,319401169,2018-09-06,12530876,Sarah,"George's place was a charming little apartment above a neighbourhood cafe the Thisio area. Do note that the cafe is open till late and you will be able to hear the music playing from below you, but if you are a person who isn't fussed about background noises like me, you won't have any issues sleeping. <br/><br/> Location was really convenient as the Thisio metro station was just a short 5 to 8 mins walk and if you felt like walking, the Acropolis as well as Monastiraki areas are totally doable by foot if you choose not to take the Metro (which i have done so on some days). The neighbourhood also felt safe and as a solo female traveller, I didn't feel unsafe at any point while walking around the area."
14247182,320075471,2018-09-08,191523951,Gail,"Such a stunning location.  Very central surrounded by pubs, restaurants and street markets.<br/>Accommodation basic but adequate. Bathroom not great. Plumbing very old. George was a very responsive host, always available if needed."

14247182,322076516,2018-09-12,20955544,Naomi,"This is a cosy apartment in a fantastic location for Athens. It is just a short walk up the hill to the Acropolis, or to Monsteriaki or even Syntagma in less than 15-20 mins walk. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within a few steps of the apartment, some with rooftop views of the acropolis that will leave you speechless.<br/>The apartment is very good value for money for its location, size and amenities. All the basics are there. The bed is firm but comfortable, the hot water is hot and there is enough space for two to be comfortable.<br/>There will be some noise from the street at night, or from the bar downstairs so if you need silence to sleep this might not be the place for you. I just giggled at an old man teaching young tourists how to swear in Greek late into the evening. It is all part of the Athenian experience!"
14247182,323196052,2018-09-15,200001650,Tristan,"George was lovely and quick to get back to me when I had a question upon arriving to the AirBnb. It's very close to the Metro, and is easy to get there from the Airport.<br/><br/>It is a modest apartment, with everything you need to make yourself at home in Athens. The bathroom is a bit cramped, but there is a washing machine which is helpful if you're staying in the city for a while, or if you travel very light. It's a great place to stay for the cost.<br/><br/>I had read reviews that the cafe downstairs could be noisy, but I found that it was nice to hear the sounds of the city, and it wasn't loud enough to disrupt my sleep at all. It's easy to walk to the Acropolis and explore the city by foot from George's AirBnb."
14247182,324883417,2018-09-18,191026215,Sydney,Great place in a perfect location. George's place was very close to many of the historical  sites in Athens and had a lot of character. The apartment is not over the top but has all the basic amenities needed for a great trip. Would definitely recommend this spot!

No hace falta coger ningún medio de transporte para llegar a todos los sitios de interés y la zona es de las mejores de Atenas con paseos fantásticos. Solo tiene una habitación con una cama, muy cómoda y grande, una mesa con dos sillas, un armario y un arcón pequeño. Es un primero y por ello no es muy luminoso y hay a veces ruido de la calle y del bar de abajo. La cocina y el baño son lo peor porque son muy pequeños y antiguos. Todo funciona muy bien: el agua caliente, el wifi, la calefacción (de aire acondicionado). Las fotos del anuncio reflejan muy bien lo que es la casa. Volvería sin dudar."

Kitchen is basic but there’s a supermarket nearby if you fancy cooking something up. Plenty of cafes and restaurants about otherwise. I really enjoyed my stay here ~ very comfortable and great heater as it was storming and raining on one of the nights I stayed. it is situated above a bar/cafe so Saturday night was noisy but it was all part of the experience. Definitely recommend to seek this place out as an option to stay in Athens

14247182,447213280,2019-05-03,6005849,Jinyoung,"Overall, good value and awesome location. I didn't even use public tranporation at all. Most of them are in walking distances in a safe area. <br/><br/>But bear in mind that the noise level at night can be really challenging. The bar right outside closes like 3am. The apartment facilities look old and there was time that I was struggling to get hot water. <br/><br/>Although George is always ready to help, communication was done on messages only, so it was a bit hectic when there're things to be solved soon."
14247182,450770313,2019-05-10,20423318,Tom,Great place in a very nice area of Athens
14247182,451125744,2019-05-11,24171668,Carolina,George’s place was great! The location is excellent. We were in an area very close to the touristic attractions as well as good restaurants and metro station. George communicates super fast and is prompt to answer any question. I highly recommend this place.
14247182,454918918,2019-05-19,253828933,Julian,"George place was the perfect location for our two day stop over at athens. The apartement is positioned in a very nice area (Restaurants, Roof Top Bars...) and allows to explore the most cultural site by foot. Its also covenient to get to and from (airport or ferry) by metro. George responded always quickly and the Check-in was eventhough we arrived late, easy."
14247182,457485443,2019-05-24,29229273,Michele,"George’s place is in an amazing location, extremely close to all common attractions and on the subway line. We were able to walk everywhere, which was great. The place is clean and perfect as a jumping off post. George was also extremely accommodating with respect to our very late arrival and was quick to respond to messages. I would recommend ear plugs for future guests as there is a somewhat popular bar/cafe on the first floor; with the earplugs, I didn’t hear anything. Thanks George!"
14247182,462320999,2019-06-02,58727,Georg,Great stay at a very nice place with a really amazing location!!<br/>George was a great host who took the time to understand all our needs.<br/>Thanks
14247182,467915882,2019-06-11,251640052,Caroline,This location is great and within walking distance to all the major sites! George was a great host who was very quick with his responses to us. The cafe below the apartment is a little noisy at night but other than that this location was perfect for our quick visit to Athens! Would stay here again.
14247182,468765274,2019-06-13,117245447,Dana,George is a really lovely host and keeps communication lines open. The place is in a very good part of Athens where you feel safe (some parts in Athens aren’t very good to stay in). The flat has everything you need. The only thing is that you can hear everything in the apartments above you and the cafe below but it’s easy to sleep through it when you have had exhausting days exploring Athens!
14247182,469258101,2019-06-14,83113478,Helen,"George’s place was exactly as described, comfy and cosy. It’s location is great. A small stroll in the evening and you stop in your tracks at the sight of the Parthenon, all lit up, just a touch away!"
14247182,471271521,2019-06-17,76282151,Serene,"George’s place was really convenient, with a lot of bustling restaurants and activities just a few minutes away. You’ll definitely have a lot to do in the evening. It was a safe neighbourhood and short walking distance to many key attractions (eg Acropolis, Syntagma Square). It can get noisy at night but that didnt bother us too much. One area of improvement would definitely be the bathroom, which wasnt so clearly captured in the photos but was pretty old with some chipped tiles on the floor. If you’re super picky about cleanliness then this may be uncomfortable for you. Other than that, this place was great :)"
14247182,471750596,2019-06-18,1211059,Yuriy,Simple and comfortable place to stay in absolutely great location. George is a very responsive and helpful host!
14247182,473201935,2019-06-21,64950354,Elizabeth,George and his Airbnb are just outstanding. George ensures that my boyfriend I were taken care of and do above and beyond by doing so. He is such a kind and thoughtful host. His apartment was also absolutely perfect for what we needed with easy access to amazing food and all the sites. Couldn’t recommend this Airbnb enough!

14247182,488572656,2019-07-15,219047464,Dustin,AMAZING location you rely can’t beat it.  George is also very quick to respond and help you with anything.
14247182,493328678,2019-07-22,5546362,Molly,"The apartment suited our needs perfectly: affordable, conveniently located and clean. The street is a bit loud at night, so bring earplugs if you’re a sensitive sleeper! George is wonderful and very quick to respond to questions. Recommended!"
14247182,493771575,2019-07-23,52877647,Alexis,"George’s apartment is the perfect launching pad to experience the hip and happening city that is Athens. Centrally located and close to one of the most historically fascinating walks in Europe. The flat itself is lovely and well-kept, and right on one of the nicest streets I’ve been on in the city, tree-lined with friendly cafes and tavernas below. It’s in walking distance too to interesting neighbourhoods like Keramaikos. Would thoroughly recommend!"
14247182,502905439,2019-08-05,147880439,Danni,"We had a great stay here in Athens the room was fantastic great location, very clean and we felt totally safe in this area. Would 100% stay again when visiting Athens. Great coffee shops and restaurants very close by. Thanks again."
14247182,506129154,2019-08-10,59725348,Nury,"George’s place is a cozy apartment in great location to visit Athens. Next to Thissio station, it’s near to great places to cafes and restaurants, and to visit all the Ancient Greece amazing places in Athens."
14247182,508619068,2019-08-13,185324525,Henriette Edvarda Ingeborg,"Very nice and clean place situated at the center of Athens, close to many of the attractions, parks, popular streets and shopping. George is super sweet and very forthcoming, and seems delighted to help with any issue or question you might have. The only thing to comment on, is all the noise coming from the bar right underneath the apartment at night. Loud voices and lots of people hanging out, drinking and talking, made it difficult to find a good night's sleep."
14247182,509906429,2019-08-15,115750339,Jonah,Great place in great location!

14247182,513338911,2019-08-19,257434827,Elizabeth,George was incredibly helpful on my trip to Athens! He gave me step by step instructions about how to get to the place-complete with cost and time estimates- and checkin that included pictures which were invaluable since I checked in later and it was already dark outside. He answered all my questions kindly and quickly. The space was clean and well-kept and close to everything that I wanted to do with my limited time in the city. Check out is very easy as well and is later in the morning so it accommodates travel plans better.
14247182,519786087,2019-08-29,77219660,Mohammed,"L'appartement de George est idéalement situé pour bien visiter Athènes, de jour comme de nuit, en toute sécurité."
14247182,520583441,2019-08-30,31834618,Rani,Place is as described but the room is above a bar.

14247182,529754850,2019-09-15,128419743,Brayana,"Ok first of all the location was good, very good close to everything. But the flat was not in good condition, there was a problem with warm water, you could only have for 5-8 minutes after doing some kind of maneuver, the WC was terrible in order to flush it, you had to pull a button from another bucket of water over the wc, it was uncomfortable and really weird. The flat was smaller and not well prepared to receive people in general, great location and that’s it. Be aware"
14247182,530694722,2019-09-16,263905120,Mary Ellen,George's place was in a fantastic location if you're looking to go to the Acropolis!

14247182,531790016,2019-09-18,21663650,Luka,"A truly great, clean, unpretentious apartment with everything you could need in literally the best location in Athens. I’m going to stay at this place every time I visit Athens from now on. George is helpful, the neighbourhood beautiful, the cafe downstairs has a great vibe and in 20 steps you can see the Acropolis . Perfect."

14247182,537042848,2019-09-28,36126156,欣亚,"Very good location, easy to arrive almost places of interest. The apartment is clean but a little bit noisy since downstairs there is a bar. And there is no slippers and toothbrush and toothpaste, guests should prepare yourselves."
14247182,539892290,2019-10-02,45106909,Colin,This is an ideal apartment for those who plan to visit the Acropolis. George is an outstanding host. I strongly recommend this apartment.

14247182,552222002,2019-10-21,7121527,Roberta,"Location is perfect! Walking distance from the main attractions, restaurants, bars, supermarket and metro station. I stayed there during the weekend so I could hear people talking and also listen to the good  playlist  from the coffee shop just under the bedroom window. The apartment has all you need to make a quick meal, the bed is comfortable, good internet connection. I highly recommend the place!!!"

14247182,638578166,2020-07-16,43311388,Maria Luisa,"Wow! I do not recommend this place. It was terrible, the mattress was extremely uncomfortable, the pillows were thin like paper, we only got a small sheet to cover during the night, the bathroom it’s hideous and the hot water runs for only 5 min. It is not worth it for the price. It was dirty, moldy, electrical outlets falling apart and the painting was coming off. Ghetto apartment. Not sanitary. I stayed in another place in Athens for the same price and it was not even close to this one."
14247182,640403138,2020-07-20,54975573,Iacovos,"Beautiful, cozy little flat in what's probably the best area of Athens, especially if you're there for sightseeing. Perfect for a short-term stay."

If you want to stay in a residential part of Athens and yet be in easy walking distance to all major sites and nightlife this appartment is a great deal."
14247182,664232855,2020-09-14,365990353,Jorge,George answered me really quick with all info I needed it.<br/><br/>The space is cosy perfect size for a couple or solo traveler. Location is amazing and marvellous around there. <br/><br/>Perfect for a couple of days.
14247182,669319815,2020-09-29,37748631,Clementine,"My stay at George's flat was great! I loved the area, I could just go round the corner to grab food or a drink at the cafe just below. Very friendly, vibrant neighbourhood. Also very relaxing to walk around the acropolis several times a day going in and out of the flat. The space is cute and convenient, I liked the candles for cosy evenings. The cafe downstairs is noisy but with good earplugs I slept just fine! The people at the cafe are very friendly too. George has been very responsive / clear in his indications so the stay was really smooth. Thanks again :)"

14247182,398307499201173710,2021-07-03,235336347,Christina,"Wonderful locations with everything one could need! The spot was walking distance from many of the sights in Athens and across the street from a museum, surrounded by very nice cafes. The nightlife was accessible and there were cute feline friends on the sidewalk outside. The room has extra bedding and many kitchen appliances for cooking. It is stocked also on cleaning supplies if needed but the apartment was very clean. The washer was in English which was very helpful and there was even some coffee supplies as well as water in the fridge when I arrived. George was an excellent host and responds quite fast and with helpful information. Parking was also not an issue, there was plenty of free parking nearby. If you are staying in Athens, especially for a long time, I would highly recommend staying here! I loved it and the trip would not have been the same without <3"

Toll gelegene Unterkunft, mitten im Leben aber durch die Lage an einer Fußgängerzone absolut ruhig. Unten vor dem Haus befindet sich unter alten Bäumen eine gemütliche Taverne. Immer gut für einen Absacker, wenn man abends spät nach Hause kommt."
14247182,404738692385673275,2021-07-12,14422136,Thomas,Tèo is a great host! He was kind enough to provide clear instructions on taking the metro from the airport to his apartment and even waited for our arrival around midnight to give the keys! The place is very well situated within walking distance to the Acropolis as well as a very lively neighborhood with nice restaurants and bars around. Tèo was also kind enough to let me use the washing machine in the apartment. I highly recommend this place!

The host also printed our ferry tickets last minute which was so nice! No frills but clean and good place for travelers looking for a place to cool off, sleep, and house their things."
14247182,446050208055483358,2021-09-07,20398206,Elena,"Thanks! Teo&George are lovely hosts. There was all we needed for three days in Athens. Location is great as it is in walking 5 min distance to Thisio metro, 10 min Monastiraki which both are easy to get around or from/to the airport (50”). <br/>Next door on the crossroad is a great place to eat which generous portions all fresh, delicious food, right downstairs is a bar with all kind of drinks. This bar is a slight issue if you’re a sensitive sleeper as it stops working around 2am. Aircon helps to make the bedroom quieter. Supermarket, cigaret kiosk is near by few hundred meters. <br/>Easy to get to all the ancient town locations as Karameikos, Acropolis, ancient agora, library, Adrian’s arch, old botanical garden,  and much more. I’d recommend this place if you like history and like to get around easy. It’s a place with a character of old Athens."
14247182,448227956559447857,2021-09-10,151646300,Anna,"A neat little apartment in a wonderful part of Athens: full of restaurants and greenery, right next to the park surrounding the ancient Agora. This neighborhood is considerably more relaxed than the nearby Monasteraki district, while still being close to everything a traveller might be interested in. The apartment is small and clean, and located right above a cafe. Given that, one can hear people talking there in the evenings (but not in the mornings). I personally use earplugs for sleeping anyway, so it did not disturb me too much. Tèo and his assistant were very responsive and friendly, always ready to help!"
14247182,452575324125727349,2021-09-16,152265035,Rocio,"Teo’s place is the place to stay in Athens. Location, studio, communication, everything on point! . It was my first time in Athens and my stay here was lovely! Felt safe and like in home. The location is ideal to go to the top city sites like Acropolis, the area of Plaka, Monastiraki, Psyri and more. Also it’s so close to the metro station!. The apartment also has all the amenities that you need!. Loved it, thank you so much Teo!!"

His brother met me with keys on time and was also very nice.<br/>The location is great. Iraklidon street and surrounding gives you real authentic experience of vibing Athens.  <br/>The apartment is located on the first floor exactly above a café with seats outside. Even if was busy till late evening hours the noise wasn't annoying. Just chatting of people and music but not any shouting sound system. <br/>The apartment may seem a bit grim since no direct sun goes but trust me it's a big advantage in hot Greek city :-) I didn't need to use A/C at all since the temperature inside was totally fine.<br/>I was doubting if to say but I will. I've been many time in many places in Greece bit this was for the first time that I didn't have to throw a toilet paper into a basket instead of toilet  I appreciate "

<br/>and she even arranged for portable wifi !
<br/>the apartment is located a few mins walk from everywhere that counts , or a short cab ride.

It is a place where you look for getting back. Stavroula made her best to make us feel at home and she gave very quick responce to all the questions and infos needed about transport and other stuff. I wish to had a longer stay just because of such a nice home. Quiet place in a 10 -15 min walk from Acropolis. Enjoy your stay. "
14279398,98846854,2016-09-02,47846456,Christina,"Stavroula is the best host you could have. She met us at her flat and spent time helping is navigate our time in Athens. She went over and beyond to host us. Her place was gorgeous! The pictures don't do justice to how cute her place is. It's a 3rd floor flat, so take that into consideration as you pack. But do not let this persuade you from not choosing to stay here. Her place and the sunsets are worth a million stairs. The entire place is very spacious, clean, and nicely decorated. You can watch the sunset from the couch through her beautiful large windows, or the balcony. The best part is the private roof time. You almost have the same view of the city and the sunset as Mars hill. The neighborhood is quiet and safe, just enough distance away from the business of the city, but close enough to walk everywhere. If you're in Athens, please do yourself a favor and stay here! You won't regret it."

The accommodation was in great condition and a very lovely space.  It was near enough to everything that you could walk or, if your destination is a bit further, taxis were plentiful.  I plan to stay again when I come back through Athens."

<br/>Nous avons été chaleureusement accueillis par Stavroula qui nous avait donné de précieux conseils pour le transfert de l'aéroport à son appartement. 
<br/>L'appartement est situé dans une agréable maison lumineuse, en dessous de l'Acropole. La décoration est soignée et la vue du balcon et de la terrasse est juste magnifique (vue sur une bonne partie de la ville et au loin sur le port du Pirée). 
<br/>Il y a plein de petits commerces très proches et notamment une très bonne boulangerie ( (Website hidden by Airbnb) et un café coopératif sympa.

14279398,123384618,2016-12-29,20968285,Liz,"We loved the apartment and Stavroula was the perfect host.  She struck the balance between being helpful/available and giving us space to explore on our own.  We communicated regularly via (Hidden by Airbnb) and she set us up with the requisite items for some Greek New Year’s traditions (a pomegranate, cake, cookies, etc.), which was super fun. 
<br/>
<br/>The location of the apartment was perfect for us.  It’s very quiet, but not far from all of the main attractions.  There is a small coffee shop/pub very nearby that we enjoyed spending time at, as well as an enjoyable restaurant near Melina Merkouri square. \  We also enjoyed the views at the top of the hill directly behind the apartment.

<br/>I completely recommend staying here.  "
14279398,128234344,2017-01-23,47331905,Troy,Stavroula was a fantastic host. Easy to communicate with and went out of her way to ensure our comfort.

14279398,130780751,2017-02-08,10253916,Karen,"First I have to say that I doubt I ever have stayed in such a nice apartment than this from Stavroulas house. From the beautiful and well chosen interior with bright wood and marble surfaces, to the amazing view of your own roof terrace(!) or the sight of lemon and orange trees in front of the window- it really is sublimely beautiful.<br/>In addition to this Stavroula is just a nice person and an excellent host. When we first arrived at the apartment after a long journey Stavroula already bought some food and drinks which was so nice and thoughtful. The house is located in a very nice, green and quite neigbourhood just 15 minutes walk away from the Acropolis and the city center.<br/>All in all our experience was so generally positive that we really felt at home and definitely (in the not to far future) want to come back!"

14279398,134931426,2017-03-02,34289060,Sherif,"so far this is my best airbnp experience, i would summarize it as the following;<br/><br/>- Location: Perfect location, might be not so central but still walking distance to the acropolis for around 15 to 20 min, to Monastiraki and plaka around 20 to 30 min walking, the good side of it is the scenic view from the terrace, beautiful buildings, quiet neighborhood and wonderful walks specially at night!<br/>- The apartment itself: all amenities are in a perfect condition (kitchen, bathroom,heating,doors,lighting Wi-Fi etc..) and decoration was wonderful mix between old style and smart home touches.<br/>- Hosting: Stavroula is a very supportive and kind host, she provided all kind of info about the apartment, city and even strikes times and types, she left some delicious food for breakfast which was so kind of her, she was available always to answer questions.<br/><br/>overall it's a perfect experience and definitely would stay here again, a very cozy apartment and very nice neighborhood, highly recommended!"

14279398,137892160,2017-03-18,31413761,Davey,"I would highly recommend staying here while in Athens! While you are located in central Athens, you feel like you are in a quiet, safe suburb of the city. You are amongst locals when you stay here, with access to authentic bakeries, shops and restaurants just minutes away. The home is clean and has everything you need for a trip to Athens. And between Stavroula's hospitality and the amazing view, you can't find a better place to stay in my mind!"
14279398,138723394,2017-03-21,19799481,Lisa,Perfect! The apartment is very nicely decorated and has everything one can need.  Best place we have ever stayed in.

It has an amazing view, it's minimalistic and nicely decorated yet has all the things imaginable that you might need during your stay. This place made our time in Athens comfortable and relaxed. I very much hope to stay there again when I'm back in town."
14279398,140632261,2017-03-31,117019183,Peter,Superb apartment on all fronts - we really couldn't have wished for a better place to stay in Athens. Stavroula is fantastic and made everything very straightforward as well as providing us with plenty of tips for our week. Roof terrace is incredible and the photos don't do the rest of the apartment justice! We'd stay again without hesitation. Thanks for a perfect week!

14279398,147110636,2017-04-25,49947619,Rene,"Stavroula's apartment is, without doubt, the best self-contained accommodation we have found to date, in terms of space, layout and ""feel"".  We have stayed in Airbnb accommodations around the world in the last 6 months of our travels and we were absolutely awed by this place.  A couple could easily move into this apartment and make it a permanent home.  The three outdoor spaces ensure access to morning and evening sun off the front and back patios, and the large, rooftop patio is a great place from which to view the city.  The generous number of windows allow light into the space at all times of day.  Staying in this accommodation provides you with an immersion into Greek life, with the church directly next door and the back of the apartment looking into the ""backyard"" spaces of other buildings.  Access to all of the major monuments is within walking distance, with the Acropolis being the nearest.    Stavroula's welcoming presence when we arrived at the apartment to give us an orientation to the place and the city was a nice touch. DO NOT miss staying at Stavroula's place.  "
14279398,147649725,2017-04-28,55777096,James,"The Place - It's is a gem. The flat itself is clean, well stocked and equipped, in a pleasant area. It's within walking distance of most of the main tourist attracts and has convenient transport links to those a bit further away. Athens is a city of amazing views and the one from the roof terrace at dusk was probably my favourite. <br/><br/>The Host - Stavroula is one of AirBnBs great hosts, she's kind and attentive. On my profile I mention that I have certain dietary requirements which Stavroula had noticed and done some research on our behalf for suitable restaurants. <br/><br/>Would I return? Sure I would. Not only that, but I'd probably visit Athens just to stay in this flat again. "

14279398,149190166,2017-05-03,27121708,Lucien,"We had a lovely stay, from the moment getting to the apartment till leaving it. Stavroula ia a wonderful host and found us some interesting music concerts we could visit. Plus a welcoming bottle of white wine! The apartment was like a home coming. Beautiful coloured floors with white and off-white walls, clean nicely decorated, great couch, etc. Yes also tv and wifi, but who needs that when your are in such a great relaxing place. We will come back to enjoy more the rooftop with hopefully a lot of flowers, trees in pots and a roof full of grape leaves. In the neighbourhood a really great bakery, a multi-talented butcher (with good olive oil, vegetables, cheeses, etc) a supermarket and a very nice square with great cafés, restaurants. You don't need ear plugs, but the church bells and the main road are there, so your are not in the country side:) But they form part of lively Athens:) Okay, I will stop!<br/>"
14279398,149796479,2017-05-06,111301113,Jake,Amazing place with a beautiful terrace and spectacular view. The host is very nice and helped us out with any questions we had. The picture of the roof top does not do justice. This place is so much more beautiful in person. Definitely recommend! 
14279398,150155732,2017-05-07,6944560,Michael,Stravroula's airbnb was one of the best travel experiences of my life.

I recommend this place to anyone  without hesitation !"
14279398,152155571,2017-05-15,30443450,Barbara,"This is a beautiful, spotlessly clean, newly renovated place in central Athens.  The view from the living room windows and the top roof deck are great! There are a nearby neighborhood squares  (8 min walk) where locals and visitors eat and drink at night which were fantastic as there were choices of venues and whether to eat inside or out. The best, however, was Stavroula our hostess.  She is very friendly, met us on time at the apt., gave us great tourist tips per our inquiries, and had a few provisions in the kitchen so we weren't starting from scratch. She even left us a homemade breakfast pastry that saw us through the first few days.  I give Stavroula and her beautiful apt. my highest recommendation!"

14279398,155104380,2017-05-27,14483578,Eric,"I can't say enough nice things about Stavroula. She is the perfect host, greeting me upon arrival, taking the time to show me the neighborhood (even introducing me to the proprietor of a local cafe) and leaving a few Greek  goodies in the fridge. She was available if I needed her during my stay, yet utterly unobtrusive.  Her place is spacious, spotless and exquisitely designed and furnished. It feels like home. Not someone else's home but your home. The views are stunning, and the private rooftop terrace is the prefect place to relax and watch the sunset. The neighborhood is quiet but with plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance. The Acropolis isn't far either. I've stayed in many Airbnbs over the years. I can honestly say that Stavroula's is one of the very best. You can't go wrong booking here.  "

14279398,159568800,2017-06-11,3920450,Vas,"The best Airbnb experience I have ever had. Stavroula's place is a recently renovated neoclassical building that offered tons of indoor and outdoor space. You can feel and breathe Athens past in a modern set up. You can find everything you need for a short or long term stay there - our favourite location was the private terrace where we spent time every single evening, loved the view to the church's dome right next to us.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to meet Stavroula in person since she was out of town during our stay. She did everything possible to give us tips, instructions and make our stay a memorable one. <br/><br/>Will definetely say again and hope to meet Stavroula and her husband then!"

Our expectations were exceeded: The owner had fantastic communication before our trip, met us at the apartment, gave us a map and insider tips about places to visit as well as gave us suggestions on where to go for meals.  She even left a some local fruit, bread, homemade jam, and wine in the fridge for our first night there.<br/>1) Location can't be beat!  It is in a quiet (not touristy) residential neighborhood, but within 10-15 minutes walking to the Acropolis and Acropolis museum.  You can also hike up Filopappou Hill  from the apartment (just 5 minutes to the base).  It is a 4-6 euros Uber ride to the Plaka neighborhood.  The neighborhood restaurants (we tried 3) had fantastic food and were not accustomed to many tourists, but they spoke English so we were able to communicate very well.  There is also a farmers' market on Friday mornings and it's 4 blocks away!  Don't miss out on the bakery nearby either!!<br/>2)  The views of Athens are outstanding from the balcony, but especially from the rooftop terrace!!  The owner has placed chairs on top to sit and watch the sunset. Beautiful!<br/>3)  The value can't be beat!  It is a very clean, spacious apartment, with hair dryer, soap, coffee, sugar, etc!<br/>Thank you for a great visit to Athens!!<br/>"
14279398,161581624,2017-06-18,61994581,Dan,"Stavroula was incredibly nice. She took about an hour to explain everything to us, show us the cafe around the corner, and tell us about all of the best places to visit. "
14279398,162062875,2017-06-19,111111771,Patrice,"What a beautiful place to stay in Athens!! Seriously it's more than what we expected. Our only regret is to stayed only one night. It's very well situated, the neighborhood is quiet and calm and close to everything. The apartment is beautiful. If you have the chance to visit Athens this is the best place to stay.<br/>Thank you!"
14279398,163541717,2017-06-25,6421514,Magali,"Stavroula apartment is a very lovely place. We have such a great time there. The quarter is quiet, and not far from the Acropole, and the museum of art. The rooftop is amazing, you see the sea and the town. The apartment is tastefully renovated, it's really beautiful. I recommended this place to discover Athens and having a calm moment between the visit. Satvroula is really kind and friendly. We really have a wonderful time there."
14279398,164477876,2017-06-27,127610753,Anna,"Such a beautiful, clean and well presented apartment! Despite staying for only two nights, Stavroula took the time to make extensive suggestions for cafes, restaurants and places to visit around Athens. She was a very good communicator, regularly checking in before and during our stay. The location is great, not quite in the city centre but still close enough to walk, use public transport or catch an uber. We enjoyed the location since it was quieter, siting up on the roof top terrace in the evening was wonderful!"
14279398,167466140,2017-07-07,107646167,Sara,"If I could give Stavroula's apartment 10 stars I would! After traveling for 2 months, and staying in 16 other airbnb's, her place was by far the best. As soon as we walked in, it felt like home. Check-in was so smooth - she met us at the apartment and was so friendly, taking extra time to show us the map and things we might want to do and see. The apartment was so spacious, light and clean. A living room with a comfortable couch and TV set up; beautiful well-equipped kitchen; nice bedroom (separate room with pull-out futon if traveling with more than 2 people) and bathroom with great shower. She went above and beyond to stock the apartment with anything you may need: from a first aid kit in the bathroom to a bottle of wine and fruit to enjoy. There is even a separate laundry room with washer/dryer. The best part though is the beautiful rooftop deck with amazing views! Out of the 5 nights we stayed, we cooked in 3 nights because we just didn't want to leave! We would highly recommend staying here - thank you again Stavroula for being the best host! "
14279398,168663383,2017-07-10,108609825,Mariese,"Stavroula was unable to meet us the weekend we stayed at her apartment because she was on vacation, but she checked in regularly to make sure everything was ok and to ask if we needed anything. By far the most attentive host we had on our trip. Apartment is very clean and nice. She leaves laminated sheets with detailed information for local restaurants, grocery stores, ATM's, etc, which was very helpful. I highly recommend Plateia for some great Greek food. The place doesn't look like much, but the food was excellent! The apartments location was a little too far from the acropolis and museums to walk (especially during the summer heat), but was only a $5 Uber ride away (well worth it!). The view from the private roof was very nice! Highly recommend this apartment!"

14279398,171658630,2017-07-18,31108247,Jennifer,"Had an awesome stay at Stavroula's place. Beautifully decorated apartment with everything you need! Stavroula was a true super host! So helpful even when I had random questions. They own the whole building, and at the time of our visit, the first floor apartment was unoccupied, meaning it felt like we had the whole building to ourselves. Very quiet. The apartment itself was large and had an awesome patio. Stavroula even stocked with fruit, bread, beer, etc., so we were able to eat breakfast in and save some $! <br/><br/>We traveled with our 1 year old and she was very accommodating and had everything we needed for him, which was incredibly helpful. <br/><br/>We only took public transportation home once, and it was a short walk from the metro station. I think there is a closer tram station, though. We walked the rest and it was easily done! I would say it was a 20-30 min walk to the places we went. <br/><br/>Definitely visit the bakery Stavroula mentions. We grabbed a baked snack there one day and it was cheap and good!<br/><br/>Do not miss this gem! Would definitely stay here again.  "
14279398,172856196,2017-07-22,25368229,Carolina,"Perfect location, u can walk anywhere and grab an uber anywhere. <br/>The Host is the best of this airbnb so kind and respectful, we needed something and she gave it to us a few hours later, she is the best definitely.<br/>I can only recommend this airbnb. <br/>Anytime I'm in Greece I'll be renting for sure!! Don't miss out. "
14279398,173762453,2017-07-24,31346990,Bryan,"What makes this place so great is Stavroula (host). She is absolutely amazing and makes sure that your stay is perfect. Also, location was great as it was not in the middle of all the action, but easily walking distance away. Beautiful apartment with all the essentials and more including private terrace, washer and dryer, etc. We stayed here to start our honeymoon in Athens before visiting the islands and finished our honeymoon here and we could not have asked for a better place."
14279398,174579959,2017-07-26,29437604,Chloé,"Stavroula is a great host. She is just what u can expect from an rbnb host. She is nice, she is quick to answer and flexible. Her flat is perfect, it's clean, modern, it has everything you need. You have access to the huge roof with a beautifull view. If you come to Athenes, i highly recomend this host."
14279398,176606604,2017-07-31,942936,Conway,"I considered not leaving a review and letting the world know about Stavroula’s place. Everything from the neighborhood, the building, the apartment and the details of everything were perfect. Her refined taste and attention to everything makes her the best host I've ever had - seriously every detail was accounted for from fresh fruit in the fridge, cotton balls in the bathroom, Greek coffee pot complete with coffee grinds, sugar - really everything you need. I cannot stress enough how lucky we were to have met Stavroula and found her apartment."
14279398,178300581,2017-08-05,10070947,Emmanuel,"C'est un très bel appartement, spacieux, très bien équipé, tout est neuf. Il y a une très grande terrasse privative sur le toit. Il est très bien situé dans un quartier calme tout proche de l'Acropolis. Stavroula est très sympathique, très aidante, elle nous a commandé un taxi pour le Piree, nous a indiqué de restaurants ainsi que des activités proches. Nous recommandons vivement."
14279398,179986747,2017-08-09,12746758,Brook,Book this place! We loved our stay here. Stavroula was excellent with communication and even took time to help us plan out our two days in Athens! She was so kind to assist us with our logistics and transportation as well. The house was amazing--beautifully decorated and a relaxing space after a day of touring the sites. As many reviewers have mentioned--the roof top was  so special to have access to and a great way to relax in the evenings. Highly recommend this fantastic space.
14279398,180700286,2017-08-11,135691146,Teresa,"This is hands down the best place to stay in Greece.  The location is close to everything - attractions, grocery stores, pharmacy, and tons of great restaurants.<br/><br/>This home is gorgeous!  There is a beautiful rooftop terrace which allows you to see the city from all angles - not to mention the perfect spot to watch the sun come up!<br/><br/>The apartment is beautifully decorated - simple but extremely elegant; very Mediterranean.  I felt like Onassis staying there!  <br/><br/>The apartment was very clean.  The bed linens were great quality and the towels were chunky, white.  The bathroom is modern with all the amenities - hot water and blow dryer too.  The kitchen has everything you will need.  Stavroula even stocked the refrigerator with fruit, bread, and a lovely bottle of wine.  Also The tap water is drinkable.  <br/><br/>There is a laundry room with a washer/dryer, along with a drying rack, iron and ironing board.  <br/><br/>Upon arrival Stavroula meet us at the apartment and gave us tons of helpful tips!<br/><br/>This is my favorite place ever!  I would give Stavroula's place 100 stars if I could!!!"
14279398,184153401,2017-08-19,14488686,Nakeia,"This is the best place to stay while in Athens, near all of the tourist attractions but also close to other very interesting neighborhoods in Athens. I loved walking around and discovering shops and cafes around the neighborhood and the people are so kind and thoughtful.<br/><br/>Stay at Stavroula's place, you will be relaxed and feel at home."
14279398,185958475,2017-08-23,64274912,Amy,"Best place to stay when you go to Athens. It's roughly a 15 minute walk to Plaka, by taxi only 4€ within 5 minutes. Her apartment is amazing, we enjoyed a scenic romantic dinner on her rooftop terrace. Thank you for having us Stavroula!"
14279398,187002356,2017-08-26,144845047,Stephan,"The Appartement is wonderful. You can see the effort and the love Stavroula is putting into it. The view is stunning. There is some basic food prepared in the fridge, plus water, vine and grapes. Absolutely Clean. Stavroula was on holidays but the housekeeper take care of us when we arrived and she contacted us to ask if everything is ok and if we need anything. Sehr beeindruckend, nur zu empfehlen! Thanks a lot! Stephan"
14279398,190015221,2017-09-03,2996061,Mary,"Stavroula's place is more beautiful than then the pictures really demonstrate- it is an incredibly cool apartment in a great location near excellent coffee and food, as well as being a short walk from the acropolis. I stayed with a couple - we were in town for a conference. It was very easy as a place to share with others because there are a few different living areas. <br/><br/>My favourite things about this place are Stavroula, who truly is a superhost. and, the incredible rooftop balcony above her apartment. This place made our stay in Athens unforgettable."
14279398,190367604,2017-09-04,13629878,Eva,"Stavroula was one of the most attentive and helpful airbnb hosts I've ever met. Her apartment was nicely decorated, fully equipped, and was within walking distance to the Acropolis. Highly recommend!"

The communication was very helpful since the moment I started planning my trip to Athens, Stavroula was easy to talk to and was very helpful in providing us tons of tips to get around the city., she gave us her time to show us directions and recommendations for dining and local shops. The condo is exactly as shown in the pictures, very clean and beautifully decorated. Stavroula welcomed us with wine n fruits, she even showed us how to make Greek coffee. Great view n central location (walking distance to Acropolis and other main attractions) and a very safe area. I highly recommend her condo, you will not be disappointed."
14279398,191874091,2017-09-09,17880183,Victoria,"I wish we could stay longer at this beautiful house. It's tastefully decorated, very spacious and welcoming, the roof terrace is spectacular! The host is kind and sweet. Location is perfect, away from the crowds, still within walking distance to all you need. Once again many thanks to amazing host Stavroula and her beatiful house which felt just like home! "
14279398,192801710,2017-09-11,15733845,Breanne,"Not only is this house gorgeous, clean, and in a great location, but Stavroula is incredibly helpful and accommodating. She allowed us to store our luggage, gave us a great tour of the property, and was in touch for suggestions around Athens. This home is a fun little hike/walk from the Acropolis, but it's tucked away in a cute and quiet neighborhood with mini marts and grocery stores. There are great quaint restaurants nearby as well. The rooftop is breath taking."
14279398,193306914,2017-09-13,57052517,Tanya,"How could I put into words the most impeccable host you will ever meet? From her kind helpfulness to her ability to foresee a guest's every need--Stavroula is the BEST host (I don't believe I will ever have to amend that statement). <br/><br/>We felt at home from the moment we met her at the apartment and she gave us all the information we needed. She also provided bread from a lovely bakery as well as fruit, a bottle of wine, and chilled water (which was perfect for the 33° day).<br/><br/>We just wrapped up our stay in Greece and I can say without a doubt that we are ready to plan our second holiday and will definitely book Stavroula's beautiful home again!"
14279398,194489487,2017-09-17,6863915,Gina,"Stavroula's apartment is even more beautiful than the pictures show. It is clean, well-equipped and nicely furnished. The terrace and balcony were fantastic - we enjoyed several breakfasts and sunsets there. <br/><br/>The recommendations for local cafes, restaurants and shops were great from our sampling. We can also recommend Mani Mani and Balcony in the Plaka district - fantastic food at reasonable prices at both places. <br/><br/>This is the kind of place that makes you want to stay at home all day because it's so nice! And yet there are so many things to see and do nearby. <br/><br/>Thanks, Stavroula, for a wonderful stay and for your hospitality."
14279398,195389794,2017-09-19,42862627,Kim,"We really enjoyed staying in this home.  The location is excellent, we walked to the acropolis and Plaka district.  There are several local restaurants in the immediate area that are really really good.  Everyone in the neighborhood was friendly, it was nice to stay off the beaten path.  Stavroula was so nice when we checked in, she met us and gave us tons of information on where to go and what to see.  She even checked on us during our stay to see if we needed anything.  Anything and everything you need for an enjoyable stay is provided in the home and the rooftop deck provides the perfect place to view the sunset. I highly recommend Stavroula's home for a pleasant stay in Athens."
14279398,196859151,2017-09-24,4886982,Yusuke,"We had an amazing stay at Stavroula's house! It was clean, spacious, and well thought out. The host Stavroula is incredibly hospitable, kind, and, considerate. She helped us above and beyond to make sure that our stay is easy and stress-free. She has a great house-manual in which you can find all the information you need for your stay-- transportation, market, restaurants, sightseeing and more. The neighborhood is surprisingly quiet even though located in the capital city of Greece, yet very convenient with the bus station nearby. You can also take a nice walk along the ""Filopappou Hill"" to the ""Akropolis"". Last but not least, there is a restaurant called ""KOUVELOS"" nearby that she introduced us, and we loved it! We loved it so much that we went twice during our stay. So check out ""KOUVELOS"". LONG STORY SHORT, our stay is definitely a 5-star, and I would recommend you to stay here if you have a chance!"
14279398,197642290,2017-09-26,34998922,Rachelle,"Stavroula's flat is fabulous.  The space itself is spacious, light, beautifully decorated and immaculately clean.  The location is perfect for exploring Athens - in a quiet urban neighbourhood with easy access to the busier parts of the city.  <br/>Stravroula was the perfect host - she went out of her way to make our stay most enjoyable.  I will definitely book this accommodation next time I visit Athens and wholly recommend it to anyone visiting the city."

It was very close to the Acropolis, city centre and attractions without being right in the action as we wanted.<br/>Stavroula was an amazing host and sat down with us to explain everything to do and how to get around. This definitely made our stay that much better. I would definitely recommend staying here when visiting Athens."
14279398,201854452,2017-10-09,8854951,Alexis,"Stavroula's apartment was a great place to stay for me, my husband, and our 4 year old daughter. Stavroula was very accommodating. I accidentally slept through our first meet up time after our long trip but she was very sweet when I contacted her to tell her we would need to meet later. Before the trip I had contacted her about putting a mattress on the floor for my daughter and when we got there she had it set up in our room already and right next to our bed, right where we needed it!  She even had a little gift for my daughter which she absolutely loved.  The cake she had waiting for us was also very good and a great, light snack for dinner!  Since we were staying a while Stavroula offered to have someone come in and clean the apartment for us in the middle of our stay. We declined the offer but it was still greatly appreciated. She contacted me the first few days to see how we were and if we needed anything. She responded quickly to all the messages I sent.  When we were leaving she wanted to be sure she was there to say goodbye and to help us bring our luggage to our car. I highly recommend staying here. It's a beautiful apartment with an incredibly accommodating host!"

The flat is wonderful, newly renovated, very clean and tastefully furnished. We and our two kids loved watching the sunset on the roof terrace. The neighbourhood is quiet but still very central. I can recommend Stavroula's place very much. We will be back there when we visit Athens the next time. Thank you very much for everything, all the best from George & family."

The place is amazing, beautifully designed, located perfectly- within 20 minutes walk we've been to the Acropolis. Stavroula is a great host, respondes very quickly and thinks of every little detail. Highly recommended!!!"

She answered every question in minutes, we could left the bags when leaving late and could left them also when arrived sooner. The place itself is breathtaking, upper terrace we enjoyed a lot. It was convenient for the 4 of us, in a very nice neighborhood. We also cooked there, had enough utensils. All in all, we loved our stay, it is a real gem! Do not hesitate to book! Thank you Stavroula!"

14279398,253024824,2018-04-13,1579226,Luigi,"I live in Athens and I had invited my family to visit for a few days. Stavroula's apartment turned out to be the perfect choice. The place is clean and impeccably furnished. The center of Athens can be chaotic, but this apartment is in a beautiful quiet corner while still allowing easy access to the Koukaki neighborhood, and a short walk away from the most central areas. The view from the roof terrace is breathtaking. Stavroula is extremely welcoming and thoughtful, and was quick to help with any queries or problems we had. An added perk for us was definitely the access to the rear of Filoppapou hill, which offers the most beautiful walking route to the Acropolis. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a clean, quiet place adjacent to the center."

We had some specific needs, and she did not hesitate to help us.  We loved everything about the apartment!  The roof top garden has spectacular views of Athens.  We would highly recommend Stavroula's apartment for your stay in Athens."
14279398,258353706,2018-04-29,25309284,Mallory,"I can't say enough about this location! The flat was very cute, the rooftop was AMAZING with such a wonderful view. Stavroula left several treats for us as a welcome gift which was a nice touch. It was very easy to get around.  I did over-pack per usual, so getting the luggage up the stairs was a bit difficult, but that was my own fault."
14279398,260519561,2018-05-04,4735024,Salomé,"This apartment is exactly as it looks on the pictures: spacious, clean, beautifully decorated and comfortable. Especially the roof top is as shown and a wonderful place to spend warm late-afternoons. Stavroula has been a great host and made us feel at home (away from home). The area is quiet but at a walking distance from all the interesting neighbourhoods of Athens (me and my dad visited them all without the need for public transport of taxi's). There are some lovely and very affordable restaurant options nearby with very friendly staff. This apartment is a real recommendation and can easily host two couples. <br/><br/>Thanks so much Stavroula!<br/><br/>Best, Salome (and my dad :)"

L'appartement est dans le centre et est situé à 20 mn à pieds de l'Acropole. Excellent accueil de notre hôte Stavroula. Nous vous recommandons chaudement cette adresse."
14279398,263177198,2018-05-11,14788954,Jennifer,"Really an exceptional Airbnb. Very quick and easy communication, directions and check-in. Apartment is even nicer than in pictures, with fantastic breezes, clean, big, bright. Very soft comfy beds and the nicest shower/bath during our entire trip. Laundry works well, ansd a 20 minute walk to everything a tourist needs. On top of this, Stavroula really went above-and-beyond what is expected of a host- had bread/butter/jams and fruits and coffee stocked, as well as a bottle of Greek wine, and local maps. To top it off, she helped us arrange a cab at the crack of dawn for the airport, and the driver was extremely punctual and professional. Cannot recommend Stavroula and her apartment highly enough!"
14279398,264027489,2018-05-13,11145741,Misha,The perfect end to our vacation in Greece! Gorgeous place with thoughtful touches. We felt right at home and greatly enjoyed our stay. Would highly recommend!

Stravroula treated us as if we were her family in for a visit, she even had a nice tradition Greek dish for our dinner the first night as well as fruit, bread and coffee for the morning. She answered emails quickly when we had questions about getting around the city and the washing machine was a great amenity as Athens was our second of 4 stops on our vacation. Would definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone planning a visit."
14279398,266120109,2018-05-19,153677606,Stephanie,"Stavroula was an excellent host! Her place was clean, cozy and beautiful. The rooftop was amazing, although we didn't get to spend much time up there (only a two night stay). Walking distance to Acropolis- we loved the walk because we got to explore a bit of the city. Stavroula gave us the quickest route to get there, which we took day 1, but the next day we took a longer route through the city to do some extra exploring. The city did not look very safe at first glance, but we soon discovered that we felt completely safe walking the streets. Stavroula's place was perfect for us. Lovely amenities and personal touches, comfortable bed and sofa, great kitchen and bathroom. We loved opening all of the windows and letting the fresh air flow through the apartment. One suggestion, if you plan on sleeping with the windows open at night, bring some natural bug spray to sleep in. We got quite a few mosquito bites the first night, so we needed to use the air conditioner the second night. All around a wonderful place to stay when visiting Athens, and a perfect host!"

The bed are comfortable, including the fold out (and we are very difficult when it comes to mattresses). The area is very nice, authentic, not touristy at all, and the rooftop patio is huge and amazing. Stavroula is a great host, very dedicated to making your stay perfect. We wish we would have planned more days in Athens so we could enjoy the flat longer.   "
14279398,268214844,2018-05-24,13010731,Rico,"For a beautiful place, a wonderful host, and a cool neighborhood, you can't beat this.  Stayed for two nights in late May.  The apartment is huge and beautiful, with lovely views, especially from the rooftop, which we frankly should have spent more time lounging on.  There's strong air conditioning in the bedroom (very helpful during the warm front we encountered) and a good washer/dryer (super convenient).  NOTE: This place is on a hill, and it's a two-floor walkup, so this sadly isn't for you if you have mobility issues.  But the payoff is great views over the rooftops and the church next door. <br/><br/>The best part of this place, though, is the host and the location.  Stavroula was in touch way before our arrival to make sure she knew when we were coming and so she could be sure to be at the apartment to meet us.  Upon our arrival, she gave us a helpful map and tips of places to eat and see around the neighborhood, and texted further tips, based on on interests, even after she'd left us.  Speaking of the neighborhood, it was our favorite in Athens.  Easy walking distance to a charming square ringed with tavernas, and a street called Troon that's home to many wonderful restaurants and a little repertory outdoor cinema.  The vibe is laid back, arty but totally unpretentious.  This definitely feels like a modern gentrifying area — it may not be for you if you want old-world Greek charm without any grit — but it didn't feel at all unsafe.  And yes, you can walk to the Acropolis from here.  Should we return to Athens, this is where we're staying. "
14279398,268861295,2018-05-26,164155621,Liz,Great place with a welcoming and helpful host. No regrets! This was my first Airbnb stay and it exceeded my expectations. Location was perfect with everywhere we went walkable. Highly recommend. (A couple of flights of stairs that people should be aware of if that is an issue for you - but we were assisted with our luggage and it was not an issue for us. 
14279398,269210218,2018-05-27,94706546,Chad,"This place is absolutely beautiful. It exceeds the description and that sunset picture is real! This place is a central but a little secluded. For us, it was the end of our trip around Greece and this apt was the perfect way to relax and see the beauty of Athens while being worn out for traveling with a 2 1/2 year old. They set up a ride from and to the airport (even for 4 am flight) and the cleaner, Maria, was so lovely with our daughter. While she didn’t speak English she did have a good handle of (Hidden by Airbnb) translate and used it to show us around and make sure we were comfortable before we left. She also arranged a phone call with the owners since they happened to be out of town that day. Overall, this place was almost sublime. I wouldn’t have changed anything (except for how short we were there)!"
14279398,269861478,2018-05-28,41283470,Adam,"This is easily the best Airbnb I have stayed in. Communication was quick, the place was spotless, and included extra touches such as fruit and wine. The rooftop view is worth the price of admission. I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone."
14279398,270734427,2018-05-30,167734881,Walter,"Everything exceeded expectations at this apartment. The view was priceless, the apartment is beautiful architecturally and design wise. The host is also incredibly helpful and helped us to get a taxi for our departure. The host also leaves info about the city and getting around town in the apartment. One thing I will say, there is only air conditioning in the bedrooms and we were confused on how to actually get cold air out of them (entirely our fault, nothing to do the with host or the apartment) so be sure that you see the little snowflake sign on the remote, that means it’s on air conditioning mode. Once our jet lagged heads figured that out, the room temp was always cool enough and we like to keep things cold."
14279398,272143333,2018-06-03,153825776,Greg,"Choose this place. Stavroula is one of the best humans ever! She will do everything to make your stay perfect. Her suggestions were fantastic & we had a great time. The balcony was beautiful, she supplied candles & wine and made the experience truly worthwhile. The apartment is within walking distance of all the parts of Athens you will want to see."
14279398,272806747,2018-06-04,155722518,Sandra,"Stavroula was an amazing host! She gave us a bunch of tips on places to visit and eat, and printed a guide which came in very handy. Her place was lovely, with a gorgeous view of the city on the rooftop."
14279398,273447672,2018-06-06,37347960,Alex,"It doesn’t get a lot better than this - unbelievable value, unbelievable location, unbelievable atmosphere inside the apartment, unbelievably helpful and responsive host. <br/><br/>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  experience.<br/><br/>Thank you Stavroula!"
14279398,274425128,2018-06-09,26186933,Madison,"PERFECTION!!! All of the reviews have said it before but Stavroula is THE most wonderful host - in every way - and her apartment in Athens is perfection!<br/><br/>The location is fantastic, the styling/interior decor is fabulous, the little touches are just what you need (the apricots were delicious) and, my goodness, THE BALCONY!!!! <br/>The balcony and the view was just beyond anything we could have imagined :) :) <br/><br/>Stavroula was there on our arrival (and actually assisted on the phone to our taxi driver at the airport when he wasn’t sure of the address!) and gave us about a thousand fantastic tips for the local area and then wider Athens. <br/><br/>The fact you can walk to the Acropolis is great and Stavroula wisely advised us to go first thing in the morning when it opened.<br/><br/>We used the metro to get into town which was super easy and bought bread, milk, juice etc. from the bakery that was nearby (that Stavroula gave us directions to!)<br/><br/>Stavroula helped us book a taxi from the apartment to Piraeus and was there helping us with our bags when we left. (We aren’t the lightest packers and being away for quite a while had quite heavy bags, Stavroula helped carry them up the stairs and then back down again - too kind!!)<br/><br/>Honestly, just book here and know that Stavroula is the kindest, most considerate host ever and her apartment is perfect :)<br/><br/>"
14279398,276513673,2018-06-14,147306206,Tash,"We are currently traveling around Europe and staying in many hotels and Airbnb apartments. This was by far the best experience we have had! The apartment was beautiful, spacious and very clean. Stavroula was the best host and went above and beyond to assist us and make sure we had the best experience in Athens. Great location! In a quite neighborhood, Only a short 10 minute walk from Acropolis. The view from the roof, amazing! Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone and everyone! "
14279398,278475166,2018-06-18,47159725,Clive,"Without a doubt the best Airbnb I have stayed in around the world and you cannot get a better host than Stavroula!! Everything is as per the photos, but only better!! Take your time to explore the local restaurants in the area - they are excellent and are very reasonable."
14279398,280330894,2018-06-23,9179849,Gabriele,"Stavroula is a friendly hostess who leaves nothing to be desired. The apartment is very tastefully decorated and clean. Especially the roof terrace is a Highlight.<br/>Most of the attractions can be reached by  foot,  bis or metro.<br/>Stavroulas apartment is the perfect place to stay in Athens.<br/>We truely come back next year!!!"
14279398,280814151,2018-06-24,568200,Ryan,"I couldn't say enough great things about this space and Stavroula. She was absolutely incredible with communication, especially when it came to finding transportation from the Port of Athens to her place at midnight. The port can be a bit chaotic, but she coordinated for a driver to meet us right when we stepped off the ferry and within 15 minutes we were walking into the AirBnB. <br/><br/>Her place is so warm and inviting and really makes you feel like you stepped into your own place in the heart of Athens. To put a cherry on top, the private terrace with a view of Acropolis (and surrounding Athens) is the perfect spot to unwind or talk the night away with whoever you're there with.<br/><br/>The location worked out really well for us. If you walk right, it's a very short walk to a lot of shops, sights, etc. If you walk left and a little north, you'll run into the neighborhood of Thiseio. Our favorite part was either walk really takes you through some neighborhoods and gives you a good chance to see non-tourist parts of the city. <br/><br/>Whenever I come back to Athens, I'll surely check to see if this place is available."
14279398,283157692,2018-06-29,38709814,Damon,"We stayed at Stavroula's place for the last stop on our honeymoon.  It was an outstanding stay and exceeded our high expectations!<br/>Stavroula was a wonderful host, very accommodating and responsive.  She gave us great tips/recommendations for things to do, and let us drop bags off before checkin.  She will also leave you very detailed instructions on where to find everything you will ever need nearby.<br/><br/>The place & location was great - within a short walk to the main attractions (Acropolis, Plaka, etc) but also tucked away from the overly crowed and crazy tourist areas.  The neighborhood and the cafes/ restaurants nearby give you an authentic Athens experience to join the locals for an evening.  Very clean place and decorated / laid out wonderfully.  Felt safe and secure the whole time.<br/><br/>Favorite part was definitely having a bottle of wine on the roof and enjoying the incredible view!<br/>Wish we would've stayed longer! Thanks again"
14279398,285180792,2018-07-03,5402271,Janet,This apartment was one of the highlights of our Eurotrip. The terrace is so beautiful and spacious. It’s within walking distance to all the sights and Stravoula is a great host. She helped us arrange transport to and from the airport. The apartment is beautiful and has air conditioning in each of the bedrooms which was phenomenal for our summer visit. Would definitely stay here again.
14279398,285541398,2018-07-04,103682748,Anders,Great apartment with a stunning rooftop view.<br/>Stavroula was a helpful host.<br/>I really recommend this apartment!

14279398,289866360,2018-07-13,63346854,Cody,"Stavroula’s apartment was the perfect way to end our trip. The place is spacious, incredibly clean and the rooftop views are stunning. Stavroula was incredibly helpful, with suggestions for dinner and arranged a taxi to the airport on the morning we checked out. The walk to the Acropolis is about 20 minutes and easy to navigate. We only wish we could have stayed longer!"
14279398,292431506,2018-07-18,184687820,Sonia,"If you follow Stavroula's direction, the place is easy to find. The apartment is spacious and squeaky clean. Stavroula was very patient with us despite the poor communication on our part due to wifi. Stavroula was very sympathetic when a local cab charged us more than what it should have been from the port. So a smart idea would be to have Stavroula arrange a cab for you, which she did for our ride to the airport. Also we had fun exploring the neighborhood restaurants and bar as recommended in her local tip guide!    "
14279398,293380134,2018-07-20,11674470,Amy,"Stavroula's apartment is gorgeous!  The photos do not do it justice!  <br/><br/>Stavroula was a wonderful host - very thoughtful of our needs and offered some fantastic recommendations for activities and nearby places to eat.  I can't give high enough praise for Stavroula and her apartment.  If you're headed to Athens, book this apartment!"

Her place is very spacious, clean, and well equipped, plus the air conditioning worked very well (crucial in the hot months!) We highly recommend her apartment if you are visiting Athens!"
14279398,300003014,2018-08-01,51001824,Edwin,"Spacious appartement for four. Clean. Everything needed available. Nice rooftop, no view of Parthenon but other part of town. 20 minutes walk to Parthenon and Plaka. 10 minutes walk to nice restaurants. Clean and quiet neighborhood. <br/>only downside are church bells ringing shortly at 07:00.<br/>Stavroulas is great, always available and helpful. <br/>We would visit again."
14279398,301982527,2018-08-05,5695774,Sam,Spacious 2 bedroom apartment in a great location with air conditioning and a rooftop.  Nice residential neighborhood in walking distance of Acropolis.
14279398,303410274,2018-08-07,99015981,Yow,Such a quaint apartment with a magnificent rooftop from which we watched the sunset over Athens. It’s located on a wonderful pedestrianised path called Dania; make sure to tell your taxi driver an adjacent street as ours had not heard of Dania. Quite a lot of mosquitoes so keep your windows closed and don’t stand idle at the main entrance for too long. Great stay indeed especially if you want to have some distance from the hustle and bustle of the city and tourists. Restaurants are a about a 10 minute walk away.
14279398,305435630,2018-08-11,72238632,Denise,"The best experience we ever had! We really felt like at home, even better: Stavroula has the gift to welcome her guests so nicely and warmly and let them feel at the top: the apartment is wonderfully furnished with all design details and a lot of elegant taste ,equipped with anything you can desire (even the hair conditioner!) , her warm welcome includes a basket full of season fruits in the refrigerator! Interesting and uncommon suggestions for the ""to do"" in Athens. She was constantly in touch with us, asking for any need.  She helped us finding a rebetiko tavern (an amazing experience) She is really a special guest and you absolutely feel she loves to do it.  Strongly recommended . "

14279398,310179166,2018-08-19,5314459,Eric,"Stavroula is a fantastic host, attentive to every details before, during and after your stay.

Stavroula is a lovely person and always by ypur side if you have a question. The flat is comfy and beautiful and the rooftoo just breathtaking. we cant get over it, we loved it!!! thank you so much !!! "
14279398,312254254,2018-08-23,7123174,Nicola,The apartment is beautifully and tastefully decorated and a really comfortable place to stay. A great little balcony where I had my breakfast and an amazing roof terrace where we enjoyed the view every evening. It was an easy 20 minute walk to the Acropolis and the centre of Athens. I would highly recommend staying at Stavroula’s place and we will be back next time we visit Athens.
14279398,313849495,2018-08-26,1438422,Giorgia,"Stavroula’s apartment is simply beautiful, perfectly located in walking distance to the Acropole and cool bars and restaurants. The terrace at night is magical. I wish I could have stayed longer !"
14279398,317483749,2018-09-02,172838023,Tommy,"This place is better than the photos suggest, which look great. The private rooftop deck is out of control, spend a sunset up there if you can. It’s in a cool older building tucked away on a side street (Stavroula provides directions for cab drivers in English and Greek which you will probably need), but the interior feels new. It’s been updated and is modern and understated. Stavroula has everything set up to make it feel like home. She leaves little touches everywhere, from nibbles in the fridge to instructions on how to work the washing machine to a comprehensive list of things to do while you’re in Athens. Just like the reviews said, she’s super proactive in checking in and making herself available for any suggestions, questions, etc. The location is great too, we walked many times to the Acropolis, Plaka, Psyrri and all the other neighborhoods we wanted to hit. Really ideal stay."
14279398,320618753,2018-09-09,22798752,Kim,"Stavroula's place is exceptional! Very centrally located, beautiful, clean and includes everything you may need.

14279398,322146971,2018-09-12,184562966,Tim,Stavroula has a beautiful apartment located in central Athens. The views from the roof top are stunning looking out towards the port and beyond. The area is quiet but well located for easy access to the ancient sites. We walked and found it relatively easy. The apartment was clean and well presented with all we required for our stay.
14279398,323665264,2018-09-16,182350154,Amanda,"If you are after a home away from home which is in a great location, spotlessly clean, beautifully presented, with welcome treats and a super, super host that can not do enough for you, then this is the Airbnb for you. <br/>We love loved our stay. <br/>Stavroula is so helpful, she has a great book of helpful hints with local places to eat as well as all there is to see and do in Athens. <br/>You will not be disappointed. <br/>We will certainly be recommending her to all our friends and family"

14279398,331240243,2018-10-02,25813673,Betty,This place is amazingly beautiful. Stavroula is a very thoughtful host and was super accommodating to us. The place was spotless and so stylish. It’s looks exactly how it is pictured. The rooftop has an amazing view of the city (and sunrise if you are jet lagged like i was). The location is about 10 mins walk to Acropolis which is great but about 15-20 min walk to the main center which is a bit long (especially after you’ve been walking for 6 hours and just want to return to rest). The metro station is also a 10-15 min walk away so it’s a bit further than preferred for us. We ended up taking a few taxis which were only 3-7 euros depending on how far away. Thank you for being so good to us!
14279398,335462871,2018-10-12,93229590,Kelsey,"Stavroula's place was more than I could ever image. It was close to everything. I walked everywhere, and there is also plenty of public transportation near by! She greeted me with the warmest hospitality and showed me around. There are plenty of views, coffee shops, cafes, and local drinks near by. PLUS! Her place was sparkling clean! I highly suggest her place to anyone traveling."
14279398,336199094,2018-10-14,76375348,Jim,"Our stay in Athens was our first “out of country” Airbnb. I will admit I was a bit apprehensive about it. I am so happy to report that our experience was amazing. We had an at home environment that was spotless and welcoming. Thank you so much Stavroula, for all your help directing us around Athens and getting us to the port!"

14279398,339838689,2018-10-22,116569067,Marissa,"Stavroulas apartment is really great! It is spacious, very clean and comfortable! And decorated with eye for detail.<br/>The rooftop is a bonus, but it also has to be said that you can only reach it via 2 very small staircases and the privacy is limited.<br/>Stavroula is really a great host! She arranges everything so well and provides you with lots of information about Athens and where to go to.<br/>You need to be able to walk a lot, because you will not find everything closeby. There is a small supermarket just around the corner.<br/>Like stated before in other reviews, it is not countryside, so not always quiet. Maybe we had some bad luck, but we had a lot of noise (evening, nights and early morning) during our entire stay, but this is outside Stavroulas influence!<br/>We would for sure recommend this apartment to everyone who wants to visit Athens!<br/>Thank you Stavroula!"
14279398,341129556,2018-10-26,195832561,Derek,"A very nice, clean place close to all the top sites in Athens. Stavroulas was very helpful in everything(arranging taxi, car rental, nice places to eat etc..). It was a perfect visit!"

We enjoyed the sunsets on the rooftop every night. Stavroula stocked the flat with thoughtful amenities and provided a clean and comfortable space. I highly recommend booking this place for your stay in Athens!
14279398,344203831,2018-11-03,49878876,Wes,"Stavroula’s apartment is in a quiet neighborhood just outside the more crowded tourist areas, but still close enough to walk easily to the sights. An older apartment with style and class, we wish we lived here! Roof access is a major bonus. It met and exceeded our expectations."
14279398,349375675,2018-11-17,9102223,Vyvian,"Stavroula's place in Athens is a beautiful apartment in Athens, Greece. Conveniently located in a neighborhood of Athens close to the Acropolis and the city center.  The apartment has all the amenities that are mentioned.  The host Stavroula is wonderful and made us feel very welcome upon our arrival.  She gave us terrific recommendations and oriented us to the apartment and the location.  Nearby there are markets, bakeries, coffee house and restaurants."

Her hospitality was warm and inviting.  She was very quick to respond.  I would recommend her and her place to anyone.
14279398,351564626,2018-11-23,57821219,Debbie Lyn,Stavroula is a wonderful example of Greek hospitality.  She did everything she could to make our stay memorable.  It was our wedding anniversary when we were in Athens and Stavroula booked a very memorable night and left a lovely bottle of Greek red wine on the table.  Her apartment is delightful and in a great location.  Our stay in Athens could not have been better.   Debbie Ryan.

Loved the location of the place - 30 minute walk to the center. The place was very clean and spacious - enjoyed the Nespresso machine in the morning.  Additionally, the view from the rooftop was incredible. Would definitely stay again if we were to visit Athens."
14279398,354597214,2018-12-02,25654445,Laura,"Stavroula's place is beautiful, bright and airy with high ceilings and feels very spacious so it was a pleasure to hang out in.<br/>It's in a lovely neighbourhood we enjoyed strolling through on the way into central Athens. I loved watching sunset on the private terrace and having the view from the front balcony was a treat to wake up to every morning.<br/>Stavroula was very thoughtful making sure we had everything we needed, providing tips and bringing extra duvets and olive oil when we needed it!<br/>The only drawback I found was the gorgeous Byzantine church right outside rings its bells very early in the morning! I'm a light sleeper so this woke me up each day, and I was a little tired, but I moved to the back bedroom which was much quieter and I slept much better! I recommend any other light sleepers do the same!<br/>Otherwise we had a brilliant time and I can't wait to return to Athens in the summer."

14279398,367206140,2019-01-04,125442130,Elisabeth Lynn,"Stavroula’s place is one to experience. All of her attention to detail can be felt from the moment you make your booking, until you check out.<br/><br/>We stayed there for two nights, and wish we could have stayed longer!<br/><br/>The rooftop terrace is breathtaking, and the location couldn’t be better.<br/><br/>Thank you Stavroula :)"
14279398,367626984,2019-01-05,5869119,Horacio,"Amazing place, amazing host. Could not say enough good things about Stavroula’s place or her welcome and care from the first message. I will personally recommend to all of my friends and fam asking for recommendations for places to stay in Athens to stay with Stavroula. <br/><br/>No need to say anything about the place - as it is well described and presented in the listing - other than it is even better than it looks and sounds on the Airbnb site. <br/><br/>Stavroula - cannot thank you enough. Looking forward to coming back to visit again!"
14279398,368850615,2019-01-08,231035217,Ilhong,정말 좋았습니다. 사진을 보고 외관에 혹했지만 추운 겨울이여서 옥상은 정작 사용하지 않았습니다. 하지만 걸어서도 관광지에 갈 수 있고 뭣보다 훌륭한 호스트가 있었습니다.
14279398,400510830,2019-01-12,165336462,Hannah,"I absolutely loved Stavroula’s apartment! It was a reasonable price for such a lovely place. The apartment is spacious and very clean. The two balconies offer some great views especially the one on the rooftop- wow! The sunset one evening on a cold January was just spectacular! <br/><br/>Stavroula met us at the apartment to show us around. She was especially helpful as my partner had left his phone in the taxi and helped us to sort this situation- thank you! She gave us a lot of useful information and showed us how to use the amenities. She was very easy to contact and messaged me during our stay to check all was ok, I really appreciated that :) I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Athens!"
14279398,404739610,2019-01-25,88297304,Denys,"Very clean apartment, we loved bakery treats left for us in the kitchen, great patio on the rooftop to relax in the evenings, walking distance to Acropolis, very helpful and caring host."

14279398,410012508,2019-02-09,146206992,Kerstin,Stavroula made everything with Love and we used everything by heart. Five stars !!!
14279398,412253151,2019-02-15,140525761,Timur,Very cosy and clean apartment. We stayed there for 6 nights with family. Very funky tavernas around. Host is kind and super helpful. Hope to back soon!
14279398,414336127,2019-02-19,128819340,Noraza,Wonderful place to experience Athens. Close to everything and the apartment has everything you need to feel at home.<br/>Stavroula was really helpful to us providing us with local info and help when we needed.
14279398,415621223,2019-02-23,98925908,David,"A beautiful apartment within walking distance from all the major sights in Athens. Stavroula is an exceptional host and went out of her way to provide us with ample information about how to get around, what to see, where to eat, and even helped us by providing transport tickets! A wonderful home in a beautiful city, with a truly amazing host. Thank you!!"
14279398,417151243,2019-02-26,35509490,Nazish,"We had a wonderful stay! Stavroula's place was exactly how we expected it to be. It was colder in Athens than the usual end of Feb weather which meant we couldn't make use of the rooftop but it was still very pleasant. For those people who are afraid of cats, beware! There are a lot of cats in the neighbourhood! The best way to get around without getting lost is by taking a cab but don't get scammed! The taxi drivers start with a much higher rate but you can haggle with them to bring their fare down. Stavroula was very responsive and made our stay memorable. I recommend this place to anyone who is willing to be slightly away from the city center and in to the more peaceful part of Athens. <br/><br/>The only issue we had was that the shower in the washroom is not located correctly (it's in the middle of the tub) causing the water to splatter everywhere including on the right and left side and on the floor from under the glass panel. This always caused a huge water mess and due to their not being an exhaust fan, it would cause a bit of a smell issue too. We also had an issue with late night food cravings as there weren't any good restaurants open late and within walking distance. There is an app you can use  but the food takes anywhere between 40-50 minutes to arrive. <br/><br/>Overall we had a memorable time and enjoyed Athens very much :)"
14279398,418409679,2019-03-02,6342860,Ian,"Brilliant apartment, great host and a wonderful city. We stayed a few days and only used public transport to get to and from the airport. Everything else - even with our three year old - was walkable from the apartment. Perfect communication and some great tips on restaurants etc from Stavroula. Would very much recommend this rental - and Athens!"
14279398,420264208,2019-03-06,199663391,Sarah,"Die Wohnung von Stavroula ist wirklich ganz wunderbar. Schön, sauber und total gemütlich. <br/>Toll ist auch wie Stavroula sich um einen kümmert und Tipps gibt. Danke für eine ganz schöne Zeit!"

14279398,423114603,2019-03-13,100003810,Guy,"We arrived to Greece with 1 hour delay and with no working phone, we were complying Stavroula directions and got there while 2 lovely womans was waiting for us, the place was outstanding. clean, big, accessorized to the last detail. The glass of ouzo on the roof with the view of all Athens gave us a feelings we're on the top of the world...<br/>Besides that, I made a mistake in order and Stavroula helped us and basically made our vacation unforgettable...<br/>Highly recommended!"
14279398,426139166,2019-03-20,117359416,Julie,"A beautiful home, just a few blocks away from the acropolis ! Thank you so much :)"
14279398,428864115,2019-03-26,97563554,Greg,This is a lovely home in the perfect location. We walked to the Acropolis daily as well as to Plaka. Stavroula and Eleni were super helpful in providing information on the area. Nearby Kousevelos tavern was a must eat. We highly recommend staying here and hope to return!

14279398,436998744,2019-04-14,12780120,Caitlin,"This place is a gem and Stavroula goes above and beyond to help with anything you need. Our daughter needed some pain reliever but it was a Sunday so most pharmacies were closed. She found one, called to make sure they were open and told us exactly where to go. Lifesaver! The apartment is adorable and the rooftop is worth every penny! We walked all around from here (Acropolis, Plaka, restaurants, bakeries) it has everything you could possibly need. Loved our stay and will definitely stay here again if we come back to Athens. Thanks again, Stavroula!"
14279398,442262586,2019-04-23,6681599,Amelie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Stavroula's flat and we would definitely come back or highly recommend this flat to others.<br/>The flat was very clean, comfortable and with an amazing rooftop (as in the description).<br/>Good communication before and during our stay.<br/>Lovely welcome and easter snack on top."

Es machte bereits auf den Bildern einen super Eindruck. Vorort angekommen, waren wir mehr als begeistert. Es hat uns an nichts gefehlt. Das ganze Apartment ist durchdacht eingerichtet, in frischen und hellen Farben. Das Highlight ist natürlich die Terrasse, hier haben wir jeden Morgen unser Frühstück genossen und den Blick über die traumhafte Stadt Athen. Die Lage zur Plaka ist fussläufig und optimal. Das Apartment befindet sich im Zentrum, aber in einer ruhigen und netten Nachbarschaft.<br/>Stravoula ist eine super Gastgeberin und war für uns/mich stets erreichbar. Die Kommunikation war wunderbar und bei Fragen konnte ich mich immer an sie wenden. Ich empfehle die Unterkunft unbedingt weiter und wünsche allen nachfolgenden Gästen eine genauso tolle Zeit wie uns."
14279398,450010502,2019-05-08,247835284,Julia,"The apartment is stylish, well designed and very clean. Everything needed for small kids is availabe (including baby phone). Communication with Stavroula was great, she is very helpful. Thanks to that we had a pleasant trip to Athens. I really recommend this apartment."
14279398,451218875,2019-05-11,41634343,John,"This is a perfect apartment for a couple or four people, spacious & exceptionally clean with lots of windows making it all very bright and summery.<br/>Every essential has been thought about by Stavroula from toiletries in the bathroom to food  in fridge &cupboards, cleaning  items for pots & dishes to washing powder in the laundry room.<br/>The apartment is pretty central for easy travel to all the main historical sites & easy walking too many restaurants 5mins or 15mins walking distance from apartment.<br/>All in all Stavroula our host went above & beyond any Airbnb host we have ever used before.<br/>This place is well worth a visit."

The vibe of this place and rooftop is amazing, you just want to stay in for all your trips time  Very clean and everything you would possibly need is provided. We will definitely come back and recommend to everyone."

14279398,460357710,2019-05-29,182242347,Kristen,"The apartment was sparkling clean, smelled amazing, and there was a loaf of bread and coffee waiting for us. Favorite part was having the entire rooftop terrace to ourselves. Wouldn’t have traded this experience for anything else.<br/><br/>Also, the insider information provided by our host was outstanding. She knew the best places to eat, shop, and see."
14279398,462449319,2019-06-02,61325890,Danielle,"What a lovely home! We only stayed for one night, but we were so pleased with all of the little touches and thoughtful things provided at Stavroula's. What a gorgeous, clean, comfortable home. The rooftop terrace was a lovely way to end our two week vacation in Greece:)"
14279398,465648707,2019-06-08,208361329,Pre,This was such a great stay. Small touches that Stravoula added made this place feel like home! Do yourself a favor and get a metro card if you’re staying. There’s a cool tattoo shop not too far called Arcane and they were hospitable and full of recommendations. Stravoula set us up with recs and we had such a great time. Would definitely stay here the next time we are in Athens.
14279398,466297056,2019-06-09,29238936,Sarah,"An excellent option. Two bedrooms, one bath with massive rooftop space overlooking the city. Stayed for a night and loved it!!"

14279398,468278537,2019-06-12,2981608,Jessie,Stavroula went out of her way to make sure our stay in Athens went smoothly and was nothing short of wonderful! The apartment gives ppl a beautiful space with added amazing rooftop and balcony views in a fantastic location for exploring the city!
14279398,468689510,2019-06-13,45107660,Amara,The apartment is beautiful and clean and Stavroula was an excellent host. I can't recommend this place enough!

The location, communication with owner of this place, the decoration,  comfort beds and well equipped kitchen...etc Everything was perfect. We enjoyed staying this place a lot ! Gave us memorable moments in Athens."
14279398,472152957,2019-06-19,179397192,Angela,This place a dream! Very stylish place and amazing views from the top!
14279398,476493094,2019-06-26,18532761,Jennifer,"Although a 15-20 minute walk from Acropolis, the neighborhood immediately around was a bit too limited some days. That being said, for under 4 euro a taxi can whisk you away for a livelier evening.<br/>Also, important to note that it’s up a two floor winding staircase which was somewhat challenging with our larger suitcases. It’s doable but much better suited for those with better packing skills!"
14279398,478027181,2019-06-29,256024744,Tom,"This apartment is hands down the best Airbnb I've stayed at. Stavroula checked us in and gave us heaps of tips about how to get around, local bars and restaurants etc. <br/><br/>The location is fantastic, but more of that later. The pictures are 100% accurate, and the apartment's facilities are great. Aircon in both rooms with a bed, and a nice breeze even on the warmest evening make this a comfortable temperature any time.<br/><br/>The roof terrace is stunning and we enjoyed some wine each evening around sunset.<br/><br/>The local area has some really great restaurants. Both a five minute walk from the apartment and further up Troon, where you'll find street tables and a funky vibe."
14279398,479674803,2019-07-01,47598058,Megan,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect place for our weekend in Athens. Close to the Acropolis, easy to walk around the local neighborhood, and we were immediately welcomed and given information about the area. The apartment was beautifully decorated and the sunsets on the rooftop were our favorite! We even enjoyed complimentary coffee, oranges, and fresh bread. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
14279398,481112913,2019-07-04,7536845,Matt,"Very comfortable and stylish place, great location in a quieter part of Athens but not far from the centre of town. Plenty of great places to eat and drink only a few minutes away.  It was a large enough space for 4 of us. Amazing view from the rooftop patio, perfect for an evening drink or two. Stavroula was a lovely and responsive host and we wouldn't hesitate staying here again in future."
14279398,482992991,2019-07-07,91395427,Jennifer,This apartment is stylish clean and in a great location. Wonderful views from many aspects not just the rooftop. This experience will make you happy. Stavroula is incredibly helpful and polite. 5 stars from me. I would love to stay here  again.
14279398,484563050,2019-07-09,15394365,Gaye,"Excellent apartment. Beautiful art deco building, attention to detail and sparkling clean. It was spacious and cool (we were in Athens in a very hot time of the year) Totally recommended this place for a booking in Athens. In a quiet street and can easily walk to all the central parts of Athens from this address. Don't forget to try some of the local tavernas around this neighborhood where the real Athens people eat. Thank you Starvoula for a lovely stay."
14279398,486070969,2019-07-12,50570222,Camilla,This apartment is superbly located in a quiet neighbourhood only a 20 minute walk from the acropolis. The apartment itself is spacious and absolutely immaculate. There is nothing we enjoyed more than having a coffee on the rooftop in the morning with the stunning views over Athens. Stavroula was a fantastic host and gave us some brilliant recommendations for our stay - definitely try Balcony for dinner! Many thanks for our wonderful stay!
14279398,492262399,2019-07-21,158102294,Kevin,Stavroula's place is very accommodating; it felt like home away from home. It was immaculate and she left fresh bread. The rooftop view is fantastic and the location is perfect as it's near the Acropolis and there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. I'd love to stay here again should I ever travel back to Athens.
14279398,493771206,2019-07-23,255852634,Verina,"Stavroula's flat is absolutely wonderful!!! Amazing location, extremely airy, clean and trendy! Tips she gave us were great and all of our questions were met with quick responses and positivity! 100% reccomend!!"
14279398,494833279,2019-07-25,4951854,Nico,"Absolutely amazing, 10 out of 10, exceeded already high expectations. The space is extremely large with high ceilings and a very comfortable layout. The host provided a few basics such as espresso capsules, oranges in the fridge and fresh local bread which were all appreciated. The rooftop is absolutely fantastic, we fell in love with the pictures but it’s even better in real life. The hosts recommendations to us were spot on and she responded quickly when we had any questions. Only regret is that we didn’t book longer as our stay couldn’t have been better, highly recommend!"
14279398,496223256,2019-07-27,6063049,Robert,Really would recommend this apartment!
14279398,497011535,2019-07-28,8486945,Karina,The place was amazing. Terrace is incredible! Location is quite close to Acropolis and the parc near it. We’ve enjoyed our stay at this place! I’d recommend Stavroula’s place for sure.
14279398,499860937,2019-08-01,58924330,Francoise,"One of our best b&b experience. The apartment is modern and tastefully decorated. Amazing view from the roof terrace, wonderful, kind and helpful host. Superb experience and as thoroughly enjoyed as two years ago. Highly recommended!"

14279398,506921375,2019-08-11,34193630,Dan,"This is a lovely, clean space within walking distance of some great areas of Athens. The views from the rook terrace are superb and Stavroula makes for a warm, inviting host."
14279398,509190120,2019-08-14,10682048,Rajiv,Stavroula’s apartment was amazing and location was perfect. Lack of elevator can be a challenge if you are carrying big bags.
14279398,511284124,2019-08-17,51354970,Megan,"We loved our stay at Stravoula’s apartment. The rooftop deck was lovely and the apartment itself was in a good, walkable neighborhood just outside of the bustle of Plaka but still within walking distance to the major Athens attractions. The apartment was exceptionally clean and Stravoula even arranged a taxi for us the morning of our departure since our flight was so early. Highly recommended."
14279398,512315888,2019-08-18,2755912,Mahan,"The space was amazing. The pictures did not do the place justice. Thank you so much for everything Stavroula. <br/><br/>The host had a printed map with everything on it. The location was amazing, the place was so clean and well decorated. Very comfortable. The best part was the rooftop where we watched the sunset and sunrise. The host was very responsive and provided us with all the information we needed."
14279398,513120605,2019-08-19,120146031,Pagona,Beautiful flat with original Athenian floors and doors.  Stylish and spotless.  Gracious with a little book of recommendations and maps for food.
14279398,514870354,2019-08-22,210226122,Jonathan,"We only stayed for one night but what a spectacular view! We weren't able to meet Stavroula in person but she sent someone to ensure that we had no trouble accessing the home or terrace. The apartment is beautifully laid out and features a charmingly designed kitchen and bathroom in particular. Naturally, the private rooftop is the most amazing part of the home, which is complemented by a small terrace off the living room. Both look out on the same view but offer somewhat different ways of interacting with it.<br/><br/>Stavroula additionally provided thoughtful amenities such as soap, shampoo, and fresh bread to round out our experience, and a wonderfully intuitive guidebook to navigate the local Athens neighborhood. The next time we come to Athens, there's no other place we'd rather stay."
14279398,517120913,2019-08-25,25024119,Thomas,"beautiful, spotlessly clean apartment with a large roof terrace with a beautiful wide view, perfect for having your dinner at home; Stavroula and Eleni are perfect hosts; everything was just perfect"

14279398,523278589,2019-09-03,6908901,Tim,"Hands down, one of the best airbnb places I've stayed in (if not the best). Immaculately clean, beautifully appointed, in a terrific neighbour and just behind the Acropolis, this apartment is shockingly good value. Spacious rooms, with beautiful outlooks, it also has the most wonderful rooftop (even better than the amazing photos). But best of all, Stavroula is one of those hosts who thinks of everything and responds immediately. Her cousin Eleni met us, late at night, and went through all the amenities and gave us the lowdown on the city and the neighbourhood. It's literally perfect. I'm coming back, for sure."
14279398,524460762,2019-09-06,103722116,Mylène,"Un endroit magnifique bien décoré et très bien situé, charmante hôtesse très attentionnée et disponible. Je recommande fortement cet appartement"
14279398,525080283,2019-09-07,21019335,Jonathan,Stavroula’s home was absolutely beautiful. It felt like an expensive hotel. The views from the balcony and the stunning sunset on the roof were our favorite parts. She had bread from her favorite bakery for us as well as other fruits and snacks in the fridge. She even printed our boarding passes for us. Very central location and a great value for the price. Can’t wait to stay here again.
14279398,525604648,2019-09-08,25332741,Rema,"We only spent a few hours at Stavroula's place but we loved it so much. Very clean, open, and stylish it was perfect for our last hours in Greece. We were able to walk to a shop nearby to have a toast at sunset on the selling point of this space, the beautiful rooftop. Stavroula left us some fresh bread and grapes and we were able to find our way inside easily and to an area nearby for shopping and dinner. We meant to only use this space as a resting spot before heading to the airport in the morning but we loved it so much we wished we had more time there. Best shower of our trip and we were very happy to have ac, definitely would stay again!"
14279398,526544193,2019-09-09,19811380,Mitzu,"Really enjoyed our stay here! <br/><br/>Great space, very clean and the private rooftop is awesome."
14279398,527091532,2019-09-10,13186229,Jane,This is one of the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Im so sad our flight coming into Athens was delayed so late at night and I didn’t get to spend much time here. Had to leave early the next morning. The roof terrace is incredible and everything was very clean. This apartment was just what my boyfriend and I needed after a long day of traveling. I will definitely stay here again if I am ever back in Athens!
14279398,528960844,2019-09-14,3373097,Danielle,Stylish and comfortable apartment in a great locals neighborhood. Stunning rooftop view and charming balcony. Definitely check out the host’s tips for local restaurants and Athens attractions.
14279398,529641570,2019-09-15,10748574,Enrico,"We stay one night in Stavroula’s apartment and everything was perfect. Clean, amazing terrace view, well located (15 min walk by the Acropoli). Stavroula made us feel at home with a good breakfast and with her super kindness. Highly recommend!"
14279398,532140148,2019-09-19,270713351,Amanda,"My friend and I had only one night at this Airbnb, we were using Athens as a collecting point from two different trips.  We opted for an Airbnb so that we could have more space ... the rooftop terrace convinced us that this was the one.  We enjoyed sunset views, a bottle of wine and snacks purchased at the local supermarket.  We went for a great walk the next morning and enjoyed views of the Acropolis and the beds are comfortable ... It is a gorgeous apartment with lovely style, great Wi-Fi and I would highly recommend it to any Athens visitor.  Stavroula was waiting for us when we arrived and was keen to share the local tips with us, she was as delightful as the apartment!!"
14279398,536202741,2019-09-26,257290745,Edo,"The place looks as in the pictures, was clean and convenient. Nice apartment with large rooftop terrace!"
14279398,537107669,2019-09-28,134141571,Dee Ann,"The apartment is charming, roomy and adorable! From the special decorating touches, the fresh bread for breakfast, helpful hints to the city’s sights and the neighborhood, and help booking an early morning taxi, we were well taken care of! We had a wonderful stay and wish it was much longer. Thank you!"
14279398,538785033,2019-09-30,49660241,James,"I wouldn't recommend it if you are bringing a lot of luggages, as you have to bring it up yourself through a narrow two stories staircase. Also the church is right next door, so you will be sure be woken at 7am, and it rings every hour after that."
14279398,539439440,2019-10-01,2087933,Jennifer,"Beautiful apartment and well located away from the crowds of the Acropolis, but easy enough to reach Acropolis and Plaka and Monastiraki areas on foot within 15-20min. It was perfect as we only had an afternoon to explore Athens, we managed to see the Acropolis and slopes, and walked past some major sites in town and still got back in time for stunning sunset from Stavroula's rooftop terrace. The view from rooftop alone is worth the stay! Stavroula's apartment was richly stocked with food and amenities. We felt well rested. The stay topped off our Greek vacation perfectly."
14279398,541470523,2019-10-05,24253990,Jens,"Stavroula ist eine 5 Sterne Gastgeberin!<br/>Absolut empfehlenswert. Die Kommunikation war erstklassig. Stavroula hat alle Fragen beantwortet und die komplette Organisation unserer An- und Abreise mit dem Taxi übernommen. Sie ist eine große Hilfe und alles war so unkompliziert. Für das Frühstück hatte uns Stavroula ein frisches Brot besorgt, so dass wir am nächsten Morgen gleich frühstücken konnten. Der Supermarkt ist aber auch gleich um die Ecke, so dass die Versorgung gesichert ist. Ebenso gleich um die Ecke ist eine Bar, bei der man noch einen späten Drink zu sich nehmen konnte.<br/>Die Wohnung ist ein Traum. Riesig groß mit einer einzigartigen, tollen Dachterrasse, auf der man super schön frühstücken und auch einen letzten Drink bei super Aussicht über Athen genießen kann. Wir haben schon viele tolle Wohnungen mit tollen Dachterrassen in allen möglichen Metropolen gebucht, diese schlägt aber alle.<br/>Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und liebe- und geschmackvoll von Stavroula und ihrem Mann hergerichtet worden, Kompliment! <br/>Wir haben uns bei Stavroula sehr sehr wohl gefühlt!<br/>Auch die Lage der Wohnung ist super. So zentral und doch ganz ruhig. Man kann super gut hier schlafen. Der Weg zur Akropolis ist relativ kurz und alles ist schnell zu Fuß zu erreichen.<br/>Alles im allen ein wirklich gelungender Aufenthalt in dieser so schönen Stadt mit diesen tollen und lieben Menschen. <br/>Eine 5 Sterne-Wohnung mit einer 5 Sterne- Gastgeberin in einer 5 Sterne-Stadt! <br/>Mehr geht nicht, danke Stavroula"

14279398,544807106,2019-10-11,26321921,Alessandro,"Lovely place in a superb location.<br/>Stavroula treated us to fresh fruit, fresh bread and home made marmalade on arrival, and her flat is stylish and very curated in each detail. Check in & out was flawless.<br/>And the private terrace has an amazing view over the city!<br/>It is the second time we come and we look forward to coming again. <br/>Highly recommended.<br/>Alessandro & Victoria."
14279398,545317222,2019-10-12,54507911,Christi,The view was amazing. Very clean and stylish home. We stayed only one night and wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the view. Walking distance to the Acropolis which was a plus. The stairs are worth the views.
14279398,548194523,2019-10-17,4066202,Paige,What a wonderful place to orient to Greece for a night after landing before we headed to Santorini the following morning. The apartment is exactly as pictured. It was such a thoughtful gesture to provide us some fresh bread with jam and coffee which we devoured on the roof as the sun set. Check-in was a breeze and Stavroula even arranged for us to be able to arrive/leave our luggage a little earlier. Her tips for restaurants and other local services (like taxi info) was super helpful and we had a delicious meal based on those recs. Would absolutely stay here again - wish we'd had the place for longer.
14279398,552728183,2019-10-22,11131558,Pakou,"Stavroula is a great and wonderful host right from the start. She was quick to respond to all my messages and helped arrange a cab to/from the airport. Eleni came over in the morning and gave us wonderful tips of places to visit and directions to get there. The house is beautiful inside and the location is great. Everything was walking distance. The only thing is that there is a church right outside in front of the house, so the bell does go off in the morning. Not sure exactly which days, but it went off on Sunday and Monday but not Tuesday for us. You also have to go up a few flights of stairs, so be ready to get a workout. The rooftop terrance gives a beautiful view of the city! Very gorgeous up there in the morning and at night. Stavroula had some light breakfast for us, which was great because we flew in so late that we didn't have time to go to the store."
14279398,556287703,2019-10-29,40289824,Marianna,"Definitely one of the best Airbnb's I stayed at. This apartment is located in a beautiful and quiet, yet central location. It has an amazing view overlooking the city and beautiful church. We enjoyed this place so much that we hardly wanted to go anywhere for sightseeing, and instead spent most of our time relaxing in the apartment, especially on its private rooftop. The place is very thoughtfully equipped with everything we needed, and we found it tastefully decorated. Communication with Stavroula was great, she was super responsive and made us feel very welcome. I have great memories of our stay, and when I visit Athens next time I will definitely try to stay at Stavroula's place again. Would recommend it to anyone visiting the city."
14279398,561314057,2019-11-09,30650417,Marlene,"Stavroula's place was one of the best AirBnB's we have ever stayed at. Fantastic hospitality, great location, very stylish apartment, lots of personal touches and advice on little Athens gems to discover. Would definitely stay there again!"

14279398,566349120,2019-11-19,16047609,Corina,This place was the best way to end our trip in Greece. The giant bathtub alone was outstanding. Stavroula’s cousin met us for check in and went over all of Stavroula’s recommendations qnd added some of her own and all of the ones we followed were amazing! The house is spacious and beautiful. The area is great for wandering out the front door on foot and exploring. And the roof. The roof! Best way to end a day of walking around is to gather some friends and beers and watch the sunset over Athens. Thank you for all of your help and for putting this place on this service!
14279398,567321654,2019-11-22,16013688,Alexander,"Spacious, comfortable, charming, and convenient, with all that anyone could need."

Stavroula and Rosina are both extremely lovely and made sure our experience was truly special! <br/>The place itself is extremely well kept and decorated, with lots of attention to detail. <br/>And then there is the roof terrace...we didn't even go out for brunch and decided to have breakfast with the most amazing view every morning! If the sky is clear, you can see the ships and the ocean and even the smaller islands. <br/>I could go on and on :)<br/>Thank you for this amazing week!"
14279398,572856151,2019-12-04,43006851,Jane,"Stavroula's apartment is so stylish, charming with many thoughtful touches. The roof terrace is a fantastic space with incredible views of Athens. We loved this apartment and it is the best air b and b we have stayed in. Rosina met us and she was so helpful giving us lots of information about the local area and different places to visit. Athens is a wonderful city and three days was not nearly long enough. Can't wait to come back. Thank you to Stavroula for being  such a fantastic host."

14279398,577865524,2019-12-16,3268531,Robert,"Spacious, bright, well furnished, this flat at the foot Filopappus hill is a perfect place to stay in a quiet neighborhood.  Walk counterclockwise around the hill and you’re in the Plaka and close to the entrance to the Acropolis.  Walk clockwise and you arrive via a quiet park at the Ancient Agora.   Climb the hill for a great view of the Parthenon and Athens."

Unfortunately my husband and I had the flu our entire stay in Greece but she made it so comfortable and accommodating. I cannot say enough great things about the apartment we stayed in. It was clean, homey, and all the little touches were so sweet! You will not be disappointed staying here! :)"

It’s a great location, it was very clean and we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. Had so much fun!! She checked in with us to make sure everything was all good and was great with communicating. I would definitely stay again."
14279398,598898745,2020-01-28,6472024,Caroline,"Stavroula's apartment is gorgeous and quiet and perfectly clean. The rooftop terrace upstairs is divine. But it's all the little touches that make it truly special--think flowers, oranges in the fridge, bread and jam, the recipe for Greek coffee, very nice shower gel, etc. It all made me very happy. I didn't meet Stavroula herself but could tell from our written interactions that she is a lovely and kind person."
14279398,601993150,2020-02-05,177555782,Kana,"This stay was amazing from start to finish! They were very accommodating with a late arrival, gave us many tips and recommendations for what to eat and do in Athens. She had left us fresh bread for breakfast, as well as fruits and jams in the fridge, and coffee! There was also Korres products in the bathroom to use, which was such a generous touch.<br/>The flat was incredible- sparkling clean, stylish, spacious with an incredible private balcony and rooftop with the best views of the sunset and sunrise every day!<br/>Stavroula also replied very quickly whenever we needed to ask questions, and made sure to check up that we were OK. Definitely the best airbnb I have ever stayed at, and can’t wait to go back!"
14279398,605728337,2020-02-15,171872426,Alexandria,This is one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in. The accommodation was clean and big. There were fresh oranges and bread when we arrived. The location was about a 30 minute walk from Syntagma Square. It’s away from the hustle and bustle and by some amazing restaurants. The suggestions the hosts gave us were perfect. We had some of the best meals of our whole trip at the restaurants listed. The star of the show was the rooftop terrace. We watched the sunset and loved the views of the city. Stay here if you’re in Athens.
14279398,607005321,2020-02-17,251337832,Robbie,"This place is amazing! The location is great, the apartment is big and very nicely furnished. Roof top is breathtaking. Best Air BNB I have ever stayed in."

Que ce soit les voisins félins, la générosité des athéniens ou bien la ville, je ne peux recommander les services de Starvoula "
14279398,611121570,2020-02-26,308536247,Jill,A fantastic place to stay close to all the major attractions and a great roof terrace to catch the sunset.

Vor unserer Ankunft hatte sie sich mehrfach informiert, was<br/>Wir alles für unser Aufenthalt mit Baby (16 Monate) benötigen und es wurde alles bereitgestellt, gratis! <br/>Es gab viele Extras wie Brot, griechischen Kaffee, Wasser, Butter Marmelade etc. während des Aufenthalts. <br/>Als Krönung bekommt man diese wunderbare Aussicht auf Athen. <br/>Wir kommen wieder!!"
14279398,640440428,2020-07-20,100424151,Matt & Trisha,"Absolutely would recommend this accommodation.

14279398,643867592,2020-07-29,2584422,Alison,"Staying at Stavroula’s apartment was one of the best (if not the best) Airbnb experiences I’ve had. Her apartment is clean, beautifully done and has the amazing terrace overlooking Athens, but what sets her apartment apart is her thoughtful attention to detail. You won’t need to worry about showing up and needing to buy laundry detergent, shampoo or q-tips. She’s thought about everything anybody could possibly need or forget at home so your time and energy in Athens is focused on what you came for. I have many new memories from Athens, including my experience in Stavroula’s apartment."

We couldn’t believe our luck sitting there every night, enjoying the sunset. The apartment is in a vibrant neighbourhood, yet quiet day & night (the beds also sleep very well). Communication with Stavroula was easy and she left nice things for us in the apartment: very tasty bread, homemade marmelade, and all kinds of things for our 1 year old son. Can’t recommend enough!"

The rooftop has a 360 panoramic view of Athens.  Through one window is a beautiful view of a lemon tree, through another flowers and the skyline.

Their apartments (we stayed in two on two separate occasions, at the beginning and end of our trip to Greece) are wonderful—refined, thoughtful, and comfortable. They’re well-stocked with interesting and useful books and guides. The kitchen  has everything that you need and nothing that you don’t (including homemade lemon marmalade in the fridge, a Nespresso machine, and a fresh loaf of bread from the local bakery). They’re located in an up-and-coming neighborhood with good restaurants and bars nearby. The Acropolis and Plaka are walkable for those eager to explore. Rossina was there in person to greet us and answer questions. Stavroula was responsive and helpful by text. We’ll recommend this to friends and family, and will hope to make it back!"

Bien situé, à 20 mn à pied de l'acropole, à 5/10mn de bons restaurants et entre deux lignes de métros. Rossina a été une hôte disponible et d'une remarquable gentillesse. A recommander !"
14279398,416333675237991711,2021-07-28,4347763,Thomas,"Stavroula‘s place is amazing! The apartment is spacious and beautiful renovated, its perfectly loacted and very quiet. The terrace is private and ideal to have drinks in the evening. The communication was easy and Stavroula and Rossina were very helpful with everything. I hope we will be able to come back soon!"

14279398,424309887037555284,2021-08-08,16314376,Sioned,"I can think of no better place to stay in Athens - the attention to detail and generosity of the host is not something you would find in a hotel anywhere. And the original tiled floors are beautiful. The location is perfect - not at all touristic, yet only a short walk from the historical centre. We walked everywhere. Thank you!"
14279398,430095100513097653,2021-08-16,10160659,Caitlin,"Stavroula’s apartment is wonderful - great location, beautifully decorated, yet also quiet and relaxing. It was an amazing place to spend a week with our 18 month old. Stavroula and Rossina were super helpful and went out of their way to make sure we had a good stay - from the homemade jam and bread left in the kitchen to helping us organise a babysitter! We hope to return one day!"
14279398,434448714751619489,2021-08-22,17425422,Mitch,"What a wonderful apartment! It was in a quiet neighborhood (we were there in August so the whole city was kind of quiet) but it wasn't far from active places.  The owners suggested some amazing restaurants so do follow their suggestions. The rooftop terrace was a great place to relax, especially in the morning and evening. A great value and great atmosphere."
14279398,435993123987117797,2021-08-24,20090743,Amanda,We had an excellent stay. The apartment was so charming and clean. We loved our nights on the rooftop watching the sunset. Rossina was very accommodating and added thoughtful touches to our stay. We didn’t want to leave! Would stay again and definitely recommend. Thank you!
14279398,438157604269016475,2021-08-27,162900450,Alexander,"Great place for a visit of Athens. Supermarket, bakery, bars and restaurants close by. Walking distance to Akropolis and Plaka. Beautiful flat, terrace with an extraordinary view, quiet area. <br/>Hosts are very supportive, easy to communicate with and very helpful. Recommendation without reservations!"

14279398,451121735615310902,2021-09-14,35112978,Charity,"The place was spacious, clean and tidy.  Rossina was there to greet us and helped me carry my giant bag up the two flights of stairs which was very sweet!  Both ladies were super helpful during our stay, even brought us some detergent when we ran out which was much appreciated!  The rooftop was amazing!!  We sat up there two nights of our stay and watched the sunset.  The only thing that was a slight negative for me was how far the place seemed from all the action.  A 20-30 minute walk isnt far but it is after you’ve been walking all day long and a cab won’t take you from Plaka back to this town.  I’m not sure why they wouldn’t but our feet were killing us after days of walking, so we tried taking a cab home and ended up walking the rest back.  Just be expected to walk a lot.  Again this is no fault of theirs, just something to be mindful of.  We loved all the personal touches around the house and really appreciated all the local recommendations.  The house is stocked with literally everything you need, including bug spray and after-bite spray which I was super appreciative of.  They even helped us book a cab back to the airport which was very helpful!  All in all it was a lovely apartment and both ladies are wonderful hosts!  Thank you for a wonderful stay!!"
14279398,456988026130160702,2021-09-22,3379454,John,"Just concluded a 7-night stay at Stavroula’s flat, and it was nothing short of perfect in every way. The pictures tell you everything you need to know about how comfortable, stylish, and thoughtfully appointed it is, with so much attention to detail everywhere you look. Within 10 seconds of arrival, I knew I had made the right choice. It’s that kind of place.<br/><br/>What the pictures can’t show you is what a gorgeous neighborhood you’re in, just oh-so-removed from tourist central but in easy walking distance to a host of lively, welcoming tavernas situated in leafy green public squares, little mom and pop bakeries and coffee shops, and access to several transit options. Stavroula provides a complete set of suggestions for where to dine, shop, and live like a local - I took every one of her insider tips and was not disappointed once! <br/><br/>Beyond all that, however, what I will remember most is the warm and gracious welcome that I received from Stavroula and her colleague Rossina - not just upon my arrival but all during my stay when they were always available for any way they could assist me in making the most of my time in this wonderful city. <br/><br/>This was just about the most ideal Airbnb accommodation that I’ve experienced - and I’ve experienced a lot of them! If this place is available for your dates, book it now."
14279398,459166344091490787,2021-09-25,65516406,Lyubomir,"Stavroula's apartment is unique and has a stunning view from the balcony. It is very bright, breezy, and spacious. If felt great to live there for a while. It's also in a good location - very close to the Acropolis and in a nice neighbourhood with cool shops, bakeries, and cafes.<br/><br/>The only downsides of it is that the shower is not very comfortable and there's quite a few stairs to the flat with no elevator - potentially an issue for some."
14279398,460577388554223992,2021-09-27,119558199,Rachelle,"Stavroula was an amazing host! We loved this airbnb! They have a beautiful rooftop patio and balcony, it was extremely clean and Stavroula even went out of her way to get what we needed, adapters for our chargers! She was in constant contact with us and truly did what she could and more to make sure our stay was perfect!"
14279398,462744997387740590,2021-09-30,33869408,Kathy And Joe,Taxi back was a challenge as there were attempts to over charge and finding the apartment on GPS is a challengeas you know but it all worked out. Thanks for your help!
14279398,464171512002164149,2021-10-02,33506789,Charity,"This is the perfect apartment! It’s so light and spacious and beautifully furnished you’ll never want to leave. But when you do leave to explore the city, it’s very walkable to the acropolis (about a mile) and other important sights. Plus, Stavroula will give you tips on amazing restaurants in the neighborhood- every one we tried was delicious! You can also visit her fantastic shop just a block away, and even take a pottery workshop if you want! It’s all so delightful. Book now, you won’t regret it!"
14279398,465610532194689189,2021-10-04,19862939,Dustin,"This was the most thoughtful AirBNB I have stayed at in years of traveling. Amazing amenities, quiet and safe location, and a wonderful home set up. This is such an amazing place especially if you are familiar with Athens and have a rental car. Make sure you hike to the acropolis from the trail above the house and enjoy the rooftop."

14286122,99850437,2016-09-06,32623604,Max,George is awesome. He is very responsive and was helpful for our stay.  His pictures do not do the place justice! It is gorgeous and very large.  It is incredibly nice and is 3 apartments in 1. Very quiet in a nice neighborhood just blocks fro the Acropolis. 
14286122,108470473,2016-10-16,62061487,Anupam,Overall stay was good. There was no power supply in early morning for one day.

Communication was really smooth with George and Vassilis and they were both really helpful. Not only in terms of the accomodation, but also concering the study purpose of our group. The terrace and the rooftop were really nice to hang out and have a beer in the night. Would totally recommend the house to groups or larger families. "
14286122,120041122,2016-12-07,36462802,Domenico,"I tre appartamenti che abbiamo utilizzato sono nuovi e abbastanza ben tenuti.  Gli arredamenti sono un po' essenziali. 
<br/>  Il giardino/cortile è molto poco utilizzabile perché a stretto contatto con le case vicine.  La biancheria è perfetta mentre la pulizia dei pavimenti è sufficiente. I bagni sono un po' piccoli così come le stanze dei due appartamenti al piano terra.  Purtroppo abbiamo avuto gravi problemi con le fognature che il proprietario ha però risolto immediatamente!
<br/>Il quartiere è comodo anche se la casa è in una via un po' laterale ed isolata."

We were so close to food, shopping, groceries, pharmacies, and more. George was a great help when it came to any maintenance or technical issues. George is very easy to get a hold of! The home is super nice! I would definitely stay there again! Perfect size for large groups or a multi-family trip!! We stayed there for over 2 months and have very few issues!!"

We took all 3 for 10 adults to sleep in 5 total bedrooms. <br/>Newer apt with nice amenities, clean showers that gave hot water on 20 minute preheat, good towels and bedding. Beds were very firm but clean, very secure and private once in the rooms apt though in the middle of apt neighborhood. Had 2 washers between us and we used often and hung laundry to dry on bonus rooftop patio - no view of anything really.<br/>  George had his friend check us in and we left keys to check out. 5-10 min walk to subway (Neos Kosmos stop) and 2 min walk to tram line. 30+ min by Uber or van to airport, 45+ min by subway line with connections. 5 min walk to grocery store and lots of food options close.<br/> Would stay here again for sure."
14286122,142687332,2017-04-09,23984099,Alex,"We booked Georges place for a group visit in April. It was exactly as expected, with good facilities and a great roof terrace, balcony and garden areas, with 5 large rooms there was plenty of space, with books and guidebooks. George was very quick with communication, and we had no problems. Would thoroughly recommend staying here. "
14286122,144958009,2017-04-17,100878084,Livio, Grosszügiges Appartment in der Nähe der Metro. Perfekt für eine Gruppenreise bis zu 10 Personen um die Stadt Athen zu besichtigen. Kann die Unterkunft weiterempfehlen.
14286122,148567155,2017-05-01,9934915,Stephane,"Le logement proposé par George est au top. Nous avions loué l'immeuble en totalité pour un grand groupe de 13 personnes. Nous avons passé un excellent séjour, profitant à plein de la terrasse du rez-de-chaussée et surtout de la terrasse sur le toit idéale pour les apéritifs en commun et les petits-déjeuners au soleil.<br/>Les appartements ont été rénovés avec beaucoup de soin et des matériaux de qualité. L'emplacement est proche du métro Neos Kosmos, à quelques stations des principaux sites du centre d'Athènes.<br/>Seuls petits bémols sur ce logement : un store cassé au rez-de-chaussée ce qui fait que l'espace de couchage est inondé de lumière de très bonne heure. Par ailleurs, l'équipement des cuisines est très (trop) succinct et mériterait d'être largement étoffé... Il nous a par exemple fallu recourir au système D pour ouvrir les bouteilles, pas un seul tire-bouchon dans les 3 logements !<br/>Le service offert par George est très professionnel. Nous avons opté pour le transfert par minibus depuis l'aéroport qu'il propose, c'est au top ! Accueil tout sourire de la part de ses collaborateurs, explications claires et communication impeccable."

14286122,169011045,2017-07-11,119310352,Dan,"We rented all three units.  The ey were clean and very modern looking.  I had a difficult time understanding the unit access from the description, but it makes sense when you see it.  One unit has street door access and access to courtyard patio, the other two units are accessed through the courtyard patio which has a door to the street.  The private patio was great for breakfast and dinners, and felt safe at night with kids sleeping inside while planning activities for the next day.<br/>George was responsive and helpful.  Chris dropped off the keys and walked us through, also friendly and helpful.<br/>There was some kind of electrical leak in the one bed room unit that shocked on contact with the metal kitchen counter, and George arranged for an electrician to fix after our departure.<br/>Would rent again.<br/>Thanks George,<br/>Dan."

14286122,184252588,2017-08-19,100766297,Nick,"George's place is located in a very convenient neighborhood close to City center with good access to tram, metro and main roads. The apartment is very well equipped with excellent decor and air-conditioning in most rooms. His communication was excellent with almost immediate responses. The apartment is perfect for large groups with numerous couples as it has many rooms with double beds. The back garden and roof top space are great for outside socialising, however it is located between taller buildings so neighbours will be able to see you. I highly recommend this accommodation for City explorers."

However, after finding this out, the fix came exceptionally fast, even though it was fairly late.<br/><br/>I've been at a half dozen apartments so far, but the style of this is the closes to my personal taste.<br/><br/>I highly recommend."

14286122,258360984,2018-04-29,177846400,Andrea,"George's apartment is excellent for large groups or families. The three separate apartments are spacious and comfortable. We were very satisfied with the location, we could easily walk  to the Acropolis in 30 minutes or take the metro, as the station was just 3 minutes away. The apartment on the first floor was our favourite, the smaller ones on the ground floor are also good but need some improvement (bedroom and bathroom doors wouldn't close and there were signs of water leakage in the bathrooms).  All in all, I would recommend it for its size and location."

The apartments were not the cleanest and when we asked for extra towels, they never arrived. The sleeping arrangements listed on George’s rental were not that accurate. An extra cot was brought in because the common area advertised sleeping for 4 when it was a space for 3. We made the best of it and had a good time in Athens and the surrounding areas. Our tour guide Thomas made our stay magical. He took us on 1/2 day tours and a full day tour. Took us to excellent restaurants and had great suggestions for us. We loved him!"

Ευχαριστώ για την υπέροχη φιλοξενία και σίγουρα θα προτιμήσω να  πάω ξανά στο σπίτι και να το προτείνω σε φίλους μου"

14286122,344800077,2018-11-04,44979529,George,George was fantastic with communication and arranged a pick up from the port with his assistant John who did the check in. John was so helpful and kind. The upstairs flat is fantastic and spacisous with cool decoration. You are a 30min walk or 10min transport from the Acropolis which was fantastic. Comfortable for 10 people (5 double beds).
14286122,363597405,2018-12-29,7870096,Dimitris,"Ωραία τοποθεσία, ωραίο σπίτι. χρειάζεται πολύ καλύτερη καθαριότητα, καλύτερη συντήρηση και ποιο άμεση και αποτελεσματική επικοινωνία με τον ιδιοκτήτη."
14286122,413837260,2019-02-18,125110638,Erika,"George provided a really five-star place for ten of us. We had three apartments in the house 2 for 4 and 1 for 2 people. All apartments had their own bathroom, bedrooms with AC, kitchen and balcony; the roof terrace is also very cool for groups of friends.<br/>The house is very well located, 3 minutes from the metro station Neos Kosmos. All historical sights can be reached within 15-20 minutes.<br/>The communication with George was prompt. He is able to provide further services as transfer to and from the airport or excursions around if required.<br/>Highly recommended."
14286122,416211239,2019-02-24,235683794,Pilar,"Fuimos un grupo grande de 10 personas, por lo que alquilamos las casas. <br/>positivo: ubicación, a 5 minutos de una parada de metro y supermercado, que en solo dos paradas estas en el centro de la ciudad y tiene muy buena   comunicación. además son pisos recién reformado muy bonitos, con cafeteras, horno, nevera y aire acondicionado.<br/><br/>negativo: hemos encontrado moho en algunos de los baños, por lo que olían un poco mal, al baño del piso de la planta superior le falta mampara y añadir que el menaje de cocina es algo escaso de platos vasos <br/><br/>por último añadir que el dueño del piso ofrece un servicio de recogida del aeropuerto que a nuestro juicio es algo caro que si lo deniegas reduce el coste. puesto que sabe que te interesa por que el trayecto en metro es de 10€ ."
14286122,428440241,2019-03-25,120640589,Josh,"Great place for a group to stay, lots of space and lots of activities near the house."

14286122,436502114,2019-04-13,220561404,Sylvie,George est toujours disponible et essaie de répondre aux attentes de ses hôtes .<br/>Il faut juste veiller à l'entretien des logements qui ont été refaits pour éviter qu'ils se dégradent
14286122,447288431,2019-05-03,116364687,Hervé,Loger chez George est le gage d'un séjour réussi.
14286122,454924086,2019-05-19,138309870,Roseann,"The Bedding Description is not accurate.  The ""Sofa Beds"" are just single beds.  We did not get sufficient bedding for our group and did not get a response till the next day so 2 people in our group used towels as blankets.  This is a business not a traditional Airbnb .  I was not able to speak with the owner until I called after checkout and demanded to speak with him.  The Bathrooms in all 3 apartments had black Mold on the ceiling and wall as well as on the tiles in the showers.  They also told us coffee Pods will be provided but there was only 1 pod in all 3 apartments.  Bring your own coffee! Do NOT use their transport they over changed us for it. The Going rate for Transport for a large group of 15 is 150 Euro for a mini bus.  The location was close to metro and tram services about a 5 min walk.  Close to restaurants and grocery store.  Or get on the metro and ride a few stops and you have a center of Athens.  It was a great visit to this city."

We enjoyed our stay, and the host was very helpful. Transportation from the airport and to our Cruise ship took a lot of stress off our large group. With enough rooms for 5 couples to stay comfortably if you have a large group this is the perfect place to stay."
14286122,479522997,2019-07-01,2081583,Gina,"This is 3 separate units, there is a separate front door- but you have to figure that out. The location is fabulous. The bedroom door in the larger downstairs unit locks upon closing and there is no key! Be careful!"
14286122,482895606,2019-07-07,42451120,Jason,"George’s place was good to stay in, the area is good, close to the main attractions and metro and in a safe part of the city."

14286122,418557410803938297,2021-07-31,363461985,Christine,"Logement bien situé près des transports et commerces.Contact en cas de problèmes (vol de  clef, accès internet...)assez rapide mais un peu difficile si on ne parle pas Anglais.Un peu déçue par rapport aux photos de l'appt et de la terrasse du RDC.Appt de l'étage, très bien.Transport entre l'aéroport et le logement parfait : 160€ pour 11 personnes. Un bémol sur certains oreillers très tachés et odeur d'urine de chats, qui s'invitent facilement, à l'extérieur. Malgré tout un très bon séjour."

14286122,456283796438689627,2021-09-21,166387039,Christina,"The space was perfect for our group of 9. We especially loved the outdoor patio. Lots of restaurants, grocery stores, and coffee shops around the area which made it easier. The locks are tricky. We had to be extra careful not to lock ourselves out or in. The beds are very firm. But we absolutely loved our stay. The location was perfect. Just a short taxi ride from the main hub. Would definitely stay there again."
14287680,92562859,2016-08-09,40963336,Ioannis,"Ο Σταύρος είναι εξαιρετικός οικοδεσπότης, οργανωμένος και πρόθυμος ανά πάσα στιγμή να βοηθήσει σε όλα.
<br/>Το διαμέρισμα είναι όπως φαίνεται στις φωτογραφίες, ίσως και καλύτερο. Πρόσφατα ανακαινισμένο, πεντακάθαρο και εξοπλισμένο με όσα χρειάζεται ένας ταξιδιώτης. 
<br/>Εξαιρετικά εξοπλισμένη κουζίνα για προετοιμασία πρωινού και για μαγείρεμα.
<br/>Τέλος η τοποθεσία είναι πολύ καλή, σε ησυχη γειτονιά, κοντά σε μετρό και πρόσβαση της Ακροπολης με τα πόδια.
<br/>Θα το ξαναεπιλέξω στο μέλλον. "
14287680,94204906,2016-08-15,43823728,Scott,"Stavros' apartment is almost perfect. The place on the first floor is well furnished, lovely to be in, the bed comfortable, the airconditioner in the room very quiet, and the neighbourhood is quiet. Stavros was easy to communicate with, he picked me up from the closest metro station and left some basic food items in the kitchen. The internet was not yet connected when I stayed here, which was an inconvenience for me, made more so because mobile telephone reception (for internet data) in the house is practically non-existent. I would definitely recommend this apartment."
14287680,94804964,2016-08-17,8768055,Sanny,"Stavros' apartment Is a great place for a stay or visit in athens. Situated in a perfect location between downtown city centre and the coast makes transportation easy supporting every type of visitor. 3mins walk to local market, supermarket n bakery, 5mins from metro all services are available around the neighborhood including a park with some restaurant n coffee shops. <br/>Stavros was very welcoming since our arrival n has been a great n flexible host even to our late requests for extension of our stay. Great apartment. A definite recommendation for a great stay."
14287680,95875601,2016-08-21,43839366,Stacey,"Such a beautiful modern apartment just a short 5 or so minutes from the Apocrolis. The air conditioning is a god send in that summer heat. Stravos is very accommodating, allowing us to stay late on our last day as we had a late flight out. I would definately recommend that you stay here!"
14287680,99810322,2016-09-06,61549310,Birgit,"We really enjoyed staying in Athens in the apartment of Stavros. The flat is very clean and located in an area near the city center.

Overall, we had a great experience and would choose to stay here again when visiting Athens!"
14287680,100824972,2016-09-11,59450227,Manuel,"Stavros war sehr nett und hilfsbereit, er hat uns extra von der nur 500 Meter entfernten Metrostation abgeholt und sogar einige Lebensmittel bereitgestellt und wertvolle Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt gegeben. Die Wohnung ist perfekt, gut ausgestattet mit allem was man braucht, gemütlich und noch schöner als auf den Bildern. Von der Wohnung aus konnten wir die ganze Stadt zu Fuß erkunden, in nur 15 Minuten kann man zur Akropolis laufen. In unmittelbarer Nähe der Wohnung befindet sich ein Bäcker und Fleischer und auch ein Supermarkt ist lediglich 250 Meter entfernt. Außerdem ist die Verkehrsanbindung durch Metro und Tram, die nur 600 Meter entfernt liegen, ausgezeichnet. Höchst Empfehlenswert!"
14287680,102849740,2016-09-19,26015672,Tas,We had a wonderful time in Athens at Stavros's apartment. It is in a great location with everything you need nearby. About a 10 minute walk to the train station and the heart of Athens. The apartment is fully equipped and has everything you need as if it is your own place. I would definitely recommend staying at this apartment.

14287680,109535415,2016-10-22,86951143,Chelsea,Stavros is such a kind person! He was the best host we've had. He picked us up at the metro station and told us of all of the local places to see and things to do around Athens. He took the time to show us the entire place and explained all of the hard work he's put into it. It was a good walk into town and close to the metro station which was a bonus too. And the apartment was absolutely beautiful! Would definitely stay here again when I visit Athens next!

Restaurant and supermarkets are located close too the Apartment. The flat itself has everything one could need. A fully equipped kitchen, a nice bathroom and a very large bed. The living room is also really nice with all the wooden furniture. It also has two small balconys. Beside the nice Apartment Stravos was an amazing host. He picked me up from the airport (for a small amount of money) and drove me to the Apartment. During the drive he explained me a lot of things about Athens and Greece, so it was my first little sight seeing tour :) he also helped with my departure due too the fact that Mr. Obama was in town then and public transportation was limited in its scope that day. All in all I had a perfect stay and the Apartment and Stavros had a large impact due to that! I would totally recommend staying there if you like to have an 'authentic' athens experience. "

14287680,125494301,2017-01-06,26742125,Dita,"The apartment was just lovely and Stavros welcoming was the nicest of my all time airbnb experience. He picked us up from metro station, brought us home, his mom had made Greek sweets that he offered and all the smart advices of what to experience in Greece! <br/>All the city center is in walkable distance if one is not a lazy guest. Acropolis is just 10-15 minutes away. And there is even a fresh milk machine just downstairs that I have never seen elswhere.<br/>The bed is very comfy.<br/>All the strongest recomendations. Thanks!"
14287680,126481888,2017-01-12,28418052,Nikos,"Το διαμέρισμα είναι ακριβώς όπως φαίνεται στις φωτογραφίες. Καθαρός χώρος, φωτεινός, όμορφα διακοσμημένος και με όλες τις ανέσεις και παροχές που αναμένει κάποιος για μια ευχάριστη διαμονή. Είναι ιδανικό για δυο άτομα και βρίσκεται σε ιδανική τοποθεσία. 5-10 λεπτά από το μετρό και πολύ κοντά στο κέντρο. Ο Σταύρος είναι εξαιρετικός οικοδεσπότης, πάντα διαθέσιμος και έτοιμος να εξυπηρετήσει και να βοηθήσει σε οτιδήποτε χρειαστεί. Το συνιστώ ανεπιφύλακτα τόσο για τον εξαιρετικό χώρο όσο και για τον οικοδεσπότη. The apartment came up to all my expectations and is exactly as shown in the photos! Great location (only 5'minutes’ walk from the metro). Clean, bright, spacious and cozy with all the comfort and amenities one expects for a pleasant stay. Easy and efficient communication with Stavros who is always available. "
14287680,127115255,2017-01-16,25248160,Christina,"We had a wonderful 4 night stay at Stavros's apartment with no negative comments to make!<br/>Extremely clean and the bed was very comfortable, just what you need after walking miles every day! Safe area with a Farmers Market on adjacent street on a Monday....also a Milk vending machine should you need some at 4am ha ;)<br/><br/>Location was 15 minute walk to Temple of Zeus and onto other attractions, so good central spot with supermarket & bakery's on the street.<br/><br/>The only thing I would mention is to take ear plugs & an eye mask, if you struggle to sleep in a city environment.<br/><br/>Wifi is very handy and also effective heaters placed in the living room & bedroom, our visit was in Jan so these were essential but also there is air con in the bedroom for Summer.<br/><br/>Stavros was so genuine, welcoming & helpful, both before & during our trip. We'd definitely recommend to use him to collect & drop off at the airport for a friendly chat & cheaper rate than a taxi!<br/><br/>Thank you again for a wonderful stay, we won't hesitate to recommend you and the apartment - we loved Athens also and hope to re-visit again one day :)<br/><br/>Matt & Chrissi<br/>Leicester, UK<br/>Jan 2017"

He picked me up from the airport and luckily spotted me wandering around very lost - thanks Stavros. The apartment was very clean and just as it is in the pictures. The bed is huge and one of the most comfortable I have slept in. The kitchen is well equipped for your stay and there is a lovely bakery just around the corner, I ate far too much of their chocolate cake good job I was only there the week.

The neighborhood is quiet at night and about 15-20 minute walk from the Acropolis. Metro station is close as well. It's not especially central to other tourist type spots, but that made for a relaxing escape from the crowds when we were done for the day."

One metro station away, probably 15-20 mins walk (we bought the 5-day ticket for metro/tram/bus). It is extremely clean and very practical. Stavors thought about everything that the guests might need. Lots of space and can have privacy by choosing to stay in separate room. The bed is very comfortable, the WIFI is working well, bathroom not cramped, tiny but practical kitchen and aircon/heater. There are bakery, supermarket, deli shops and two good restaurants in the neighborhood, not to mention the 24-hour fresh milk vending machine across the building. Stavros left some food items for breakfast. That was very thoughtful and kind. Will definitely recommend. And I can imagine staying there again."

The metro is about 600 m away and there are a few restaurants really close by. As a host, Stavros is unbeatable . He picked us up from the airport, treated us to a scrumptious lunch made in his home because it was Easter ( seriously, who does that!!!!) And helped us in every possible way. He will tell you the best foods to eat, cheese to taste, wine to drink and is a treasure trove of information. Here's me sending out a virtual hug to him. And Stavros, you have to tell your mum that is the best spinach pie I've eaten in Greece so far. You cannot go wrong with this apartment, trust me on this!!! "

Fetch us from the airport for €30 and during the ride he shared so much about the country's culture with us. <br/><br/>Metro is about 10-15mins walk away, and the famous Acropolis and Plaka district is 20-25mins walk away. <br/>The neighbourhood is rather quiet but you can easily find bakery and stores around to buy stuffs you need. <br/><br/>His apartment is so awesome!!! We felt like we're home the moment we walked in. It's super clean and shiny and I can see that he really puts effort in decorating and maintaining the place. There's a living room, bathroom, bedroom and kitchen and it's well equipped with home necessities that one would need. Strong wifi, aircon, TV, kitchen utensils, all toiletries you need. Sofa and bed is so so so cosy, you will never ever want to get up from it. The apartment is just so awesome that almost no words can describe how happy and satisfied we are with our choice. We would easily say it's even better than 5 star hotel and will recommend this to anyone who's looking for an affordable and awesome stay in Athens! <br/><br/>"

14287680,191856865,2017-09-09,135513325,Lakeisha,Stavros was an AMAZING host. He waited for us at the airport for our arrival and gave us great tips about the area including where to eat. He was always available if we had a question even in the late hours of the night. There was snacks and drinks in the house for us if we wanted which we thought was very thoughtful! He did exactly what he said he would do and the place is EXACTLY like the pics! I really enjoyed my stay in Athens and will return to this host anytime that I can!!!

On our last night we enjoyed a delicious meal at a local tavern, watching kids run around and families enjoy amazing food. All locals, no tourists in sight! Stavros is great and flexible.

He gave us lots of helpful information about the area including nearby restaurants and bakeries. He even picked us up from the metro station. I actually left behind an important item and he held onto it for me until I returned to Athens. Wish we could have stayed longer!"

Everything about the apartment was amazing, it was cozy, clean (I am a clean freak and the cleanliness of the apartment amazed me), modern, in a great location, with plenty around the apartment to eat (you can get a very good morning coffee / snack from the bakery up the street). The Wi-Fi in the apartment was also very quick! Nea Smirni square which has tons to do is only a 15 minute walk from the apartment (4 euro Uber ride). <br/><br/>Stavos used to work in tourism and was a true professional. He answered all my questions / calls in a very timely matter. I felt safe and at home during my stay. Stavros even picked me up from the bus station (and waited for me - even though my bus was 30 minutes late - sorry, Stavros!!!). <br/><br/>Προτείνω το διαμέρισμα το Σταύρου ανεπιφύλαχτα!"

For the third person there is a couch in the living area. Also linens were provided. Kitchen is tiny, mainly clean. Only the plates were not washed well. Parking is a problem in that area, if you have a car take this into consideration. Streets are narrow and street noise continues till late hours. This is because it is a central place, so it is a trade-off."

From the beginning, he made certain that we arrived safely to his place. He was flexible and worked with our flight schedule. He had a full binder of things to do in Athens and many pages of helpful guides. He thought of everything! Juice, jelly, other treats in fridge. Dish soap, toiletries, coffee... we brought our own Qtips (ear buds) but Stavros even had those available. We wanted for nothing. He had everything available. The neighborhood is friendly and all were helpful to us. We had a 20 minute walk to Acropolis and all the sights we came to see. We had an amazing stay and we give Stavros most of the credit for that. He shared a bit of history and was extremely hospitable. The apartment was clean and charming. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet at night. Bakery, supermarket, all just a block or corner away. We highly recommend Stavros's place!"

14287680,210766375,2017-11-11,20944186,Méghane,"The flat is located in a residential neighborhood, 15 min by foot from the Acropolis.<br/>However the sound-insulation is nearly inexistent, and you can hear any noise from the street, or the neighbors' living room. (They usually stopped around midnight, so, if you are not sensitive to noise or have earplugs, it's bearable.)<br/><br/>That being said, the apartment itself is in good condition, exactly as shown in the pictures, and perfectly clean. Comfortable bed (better than most in my previous Airbnb experiences), pillow, and spacious living room. The kitchen is small but well provided. Clean bathroom, no issues with water.<br/><br/>On top of that, it was only 280€ for 10 days, which left us enough budget to organize some last minute side trips: 2 nights at Nafplio, 2 at Kastraki, without having to haul all our luggages.<br/><br/>Also, Stavros was a nice host. He came to pick us at the metro station, and gave us some advice for our trip. Thanks a lot!"

The apartment  is  very stylish and clean. We found there all services to spend the perfect holidays. <br/>The heart of the city - Acropolis - and the most popular touristic zone is situated in 15 minutes by walk from the apartment. There are a lot of shops, supermarkets and backeries around the place. <br/>Stavros recommended us some restaurants to try authentic cuisine and to listen live Greec music. Also our host helped us to make transfer to the airport.<br/>So, we hardly recommend the place of Stavros to stay in Athens!"

It was also spotlessly clean - a real pleasure to walk into.  As far as location, it really is a great place to stay, with a bakery, a deli, and a small supermarket right on the doorstep, and just a short (hilly!) walk to all the main sights.  And the welcome from Stavros was just perfect.  He offered to collect me from the metro station - although it's just a few minutes' walk away.  He pointed out it would be uphill with the luggage - it's that kind of thoughtfulness which makes his hospitality outstanding.   There's a huge folder of maps and leaflets.  I was only making a very short stay this time, so I hope to come back in future to take advantage of all of Stavros's great local knowledge and tips.  A brilliant stay - thank you!"

The apartment itself is very clean and it is equipped very tastefully. In the kitchen and in the bathroom everything which is important is provided (which is practical when you‘re travelling with hand luggage only and can‘t bring all of your cosmetics). <br/>Stavros is a really great host!

He met us at the airport and took us at home. While driving, he introduced us to the city and the main attractions to visit. We talked about habits, tourism, sports. A nice chat to know each others. On the last day he also allowed us to remain later than check out time as I had a bad flu . Perfect experience and great value. Highly reccomended"

At our arrival he picked us up at the Metro, that we did not have to wander around. He gaves us a lot of informations about Athens and was always reachable if we had questions. The apartment is really cozy and nicely decorated. If we go back to Athens, we would book the apartment again :)"
14287680,254535237,2018-04-17,31979625,Marie Gaelle,"We had a very nice stay in Stavros’ appartement! It’s well located, ten minutes on foot to the Acropolis. The neighborhood is quiet, a very nice and cheap fresh market very close, shops with very good food, ad a fresh milk distributor just in front of the apartment! The place is clean and Stavros drove us from the metro station. The place is also close to very nice restaurants. We highly recommend it!"
14287680,257171357,2018-04-25,82462891,Chelsea,The best thing about this place is it makes your feel like a native. You live in a local neighborhood with the best bakery across the street. It’s a 20min walk to most of the popular attractions!
14287680,258967544,2018-04-30,12140151,Anthoula,"Pro: Extremely clean accomodation in a very confortable location to visit the city by walk (10 minutes to acropolis and city center), Stavros came to pick us from Metro station! Very confortable bed!<br/><br/>Contra: table in the kitchen a little too small"
14287680,260488624,2018-05-04,167691776,Dave,"Really enjoyed my stay here. Eight mins from metro, neat and tidy place, a bit noisy some nights, so bring earplugs other than that 10/10"

14287680,264096711,2018-05-13,154176229,Rebecca,We loved our stay in Athens. Stavro was such a great host. He even picked us up from the airport and took us directly to his place. He accommodated us extremely well even when we had an early flight getting into Athens and a later flight leaving Athens. He was attentive and responded quickly when we messaged him asking him questions. The location is great. It is maybe a 10 minute walk to the Acropolis. The place itself was extremely clean. We loved our stay and would definitely return here the next time we come to Athens.
14287680,265486024,2018-05-17,14798957,Ruth,"Very nice and clean appartement at a perfect location. Just out of the busy tourist centre, but close to the acropolis and all highlights of the city you can reach everything by foot. Stavros is a great host, who picked us up at the airport for a small fee and gave us a warm welcome with many good advices. We highly recommend his place. It is not very large, but for a fair price, clean  and practical equipped. We really liked to stay here and would come again any time."

Host gave us useful tips and introduced us a lot of history about Athens. The only thing need to be improved is no hot water for bath,but overall it was a great experience. Highly recommended."
14287680,266424083,2018-05-20,176837914,Boris,The appartment was within walking distance (15 min) from Acropolys.  It is not big but cousy. Everything was clean and worked great.  Thank you.
14287680,267023188,2018-05-21,6552563,Jos,"Really nice and comfortable compact flat, just what you would want for a city trip.  Starves was very responsive and took the time to greet us and show us around.  The flat was very clean.  I would recommend staying here."
14287680,268505819,2018-05-25,148827341,May,"Das Apartment ist schön und war wirklich sehr sauber und ordentlich. Stavros war sehr freundlich, er hat uns sogar mit dem Auto abgeholt, als wir die Unterkunft nicht sofort gefunden haben und auf Fragen hat er immer sofort geantwortet. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und würden diese Unterkunft jedem empfehlen!"
14287680,270389610,2018-05-29,78503150,Adriana,"Highly recommend! Perfect place to stay in Athens. We had everything we needed, plus location was great.

I would definitely come back and stay again."

14287680,271674326,2018-06-02,107455070,Lily,"The location is perfect. Walking distance to public transportation, bakery and super market. <br/>The place was very clean and items such as coffee, sugar, oil, spices and paper towel were available for the guests.<br/>Stavros was an amazing host! He received us on a very short notice and was extremely responsive. <br/>For all these reasons our stay was very pleasant"
14287680,272747991,2018-06-04,5639685,Silvia,"Stravos place is really convenient as it is really  close to the acropolis, local shops and transport. Stravos had an outstanding hospitality before and during our stay.  Very cosy apartment, decorated with stylish touches and a nice double bed! The only downside is    the level of noise in the neighbourhood, (very) early in the morning when all the hardworking  locals start their day.  Thanks stravos!"
14287680,273406692,2018-06-06,176666243,Zoe,"Great apartment, exactly as pictured in the photos. Walkable to all the sights and restaurants. Very clean."
14287680,273724194,2018-06-07,5317204,Carly,"Stavros's hospitality is second to none! He kindly picked us up from the metro station and drove us the (very short distance) to his flat, which was much appreicated in the Athens heat! He also allowed us to check in a little earlier, which was very considerate. The apartment was clean and well located, the air conditioning was cold (very important!) and the wifi was working. The only downside was that his neighbours kept us up quite late, so we didn't have the best night's sleep, but I understand from Stavros this is very unusal and actually not permitted. So I would definitely recommend this apartment as a great place for a short stay in Athens. "
14287680,274026503,2018-06-08,87626819,Simren,Good location. A bit noisy at night with car alarms and the neighbours yelling but overall clean and easy to get around to places by walking!

Even taking us to get food and gave us tips about the area and such. He was always available to answer our questions and give advice when we needed it! His place was walking distance to everything, which was great! Walking to and from never felt like a drag.  We had a great stay!"
14287680,279229118,2018-06-20,140671486,Leah,We had a wonderful time in this convenient apartment with an easy walk to all  of Athens. Great produce market just outside our door on Monday mornings!  Stavros was very helpful. Would stay there again.
14287680,282689681,2018-06-28,152052010,Dalia,We had a pleasant stay. Stavaros is very helpfull. The appartement is equiped with all your household needs. You have a great bakery and supermarkt around the corner. Its a 20 min walk from Acropolis. <br/>Minor aspects: if you are a light sleeper then you might not get enough sleep. You Will hear the neighbours and Everything on the streets. There Is not always hot water.<br/><br/>But afterall a great place to stay if you want to be near Acropolis. 
14287680,283600043,2018-06-30,13486118,Irene,"stavros è stato un ottimo ospite, ci ha dato indicazioni precise e buoni  consigli per la cena, è venuto a prendeci alla metro e abbiamo potuto fare il check out con calma. il quartiere è carino e a 10 min a piedi dall'acripoli.<br/>"

Stavros was so helpful with tips on getting around Athens, and the location walking to the main tourist sites was not that far. Overall great experience and would stay here again!"
14287680,286854470,2018-07-07,24790807,Valentina,"We have been at Stavros' place for a short time, but enough to notice his kindness and to appreciate this lovely flat, charming, comfortable, with everything you may need (including sugar & coffe for breakfast, and much more). The location is great, central but quiet, with shops and metro very near. If we'll be back in Athens we'll come again."

14287680,290796083,2018-07-15,75107916,Vasili,"The apartment is spotless and very organized with no clutter. The cleanest airbnb I’ve stayed in. Stavros was quit to communicate and answered every question I had. I was delayed by the metro, and Stavros was incredibly flexible and able to leave the key with the maid. There is a grocery store/market down the road and many restaurants within 10 minutes of walking. It is a nice 20 minute walk to the Acropolis. The walk to the Acropolis is safe at night and the neighborhood seems to be filled with locals. There is a nice bakery/cafe a block away with coffee and pastries for the morning. I also needed to wash clothes and Stavros had many recommendations to help me out. Great host, great apartment, and solid location. I prefer to not stay in the middle of the chaos that is Athens so it was nice getting away from everything. Thanks for being great Stavros!"
14287680,291688375,2018-07-16,17974050,Anna,Stylish compact apartment. Stavros was very helpful with emails and advice and even collected us from the metro. 
14287680,292430310,2018-07-18,26680365,Linh,"Stavros is a super nice host: he offered to pick us up from the metro, explain us all details/local tips, lend us a baby cot... The apartment is clean and basic for your stay. Just a small note, it's quite NOISY: during the day guys upstairs are making lots of noise; the garage just in front started quite early; entrance door making super huge sound each time. "
14287680,294567366,2018-07-22,137000334,Eilon,"Had a terrific experience. Apartment is located in a central location, close to all the tourist attractions yet in a quiet residential neighborhood. The host was very communicative and accommodated some extra requests we had for him. I would stay at this apartment for sure the next time I visit Athens.  Highly recommended."
14287680,296084728,2018-07-25,183612285,Forellas,"Stavros is a very communicative and helpful host. He was available for providing information and local tips including how to find cabs late in the night and about things to see and places to eat. He is attentive to detail and his apartment was very well laid out.<br/>The only hiccup we had was to find the place since (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps took us to an incorrect location (Stavros himself came by to pick us up from there). This apartment is in a good and safe area with groceries, supremarket, restaurants etc very close by. Its a bit of a walk to the metro station though (close to 15 mins).<br/>Overall, good stay and great host."
14287680,298318148,2018-07-29,93687564,Ricardo,"We had a really good experience with Stavros.<br/><br/>He is a very familiar person and makes you feel like home while checking in. <br/><br/>His place is a small apartment yet with all you need for your days in Athens. <br/><br/>The apartment is just 15 min walking from the Acropoli, we never had to get a train or bus, since you can walk to the city center. <br/><br/>I would recommend Stavros as a host without any doubt. <br/><br/>"
14287680,299933753,2018-08-01,102675028,Vero,"El alojamiento, aunque es pequeño, tiene todo lo necesario para tener uns estancia increible. Es muy acogedor, te sientes como en casa. Está ubicado en una zona tranquila, cerca de muchos comercios y del metro (unos 10 minutos caminando pero la subida se hace algo pesada de vuelta). Stavros nos recogió en la estación y nos llevó al alojamiento y nos explicó todo, un gran detalle. "

Really the location couldn't be better: the Acropolis is close enough, but you're not in the middle of Plaka / tourist areas, so you have authentic and affordable shops, restaurants just around the corner. Stavros was a thoughtful and nice host!<br/><br/>P.s.: Try. The. Bakery."

Close to the Metro station (six minute walk). Close to the tram, and if you don't mind a 15 minute walk you can be at the Acropolis/Parthenon and the historical sights in Athens.  Stavros picked me up at the Metro Station and took me to the apartment which was awesome because, well, everything was in Greek when I got off the subway... :) Stavros was a very helpful host and replied immediately to e-mails on the Air BNB site.<br/>I highly recommend this place if you're visiting Athens and if I ever get back there again I'll definitely be staying here again.<br/>Thanks Stavros!!!  You're the best!!"

The rooms are lovely and large, everything is clean, and there are some pantry items and toiletries to use. <br/><br/>The apartment has a heat pump/ air-conditioning unit in the bedroom, and then also a plug-in radiator, which is great in winter. <br/><br/>Stavros really deserves his superhost status! He is always contactable, and ready to help wherever possible. There is also plenty of information about Athens in the apartment for you to read. We really enjoyed our stay!"

He gave us good recommendations on where to eat and what to do, and when we go back to Greece, we'll definitely look to stay at his place again! :)"

14287680,416835052,2019-02-25,8199443,Susana + Sebastian,"Stavros apartment is very nice and clean, exactly as you can see on the pictures. It is a 10-15 min walk to Akropolis, so you can walk to all the important sights. But also public transport is right in the vicinity. There is a bakery and a small supermarket nearby as well as some retaurants. Stavros was a very nice host, who even kindly picked us up wirh the car on our busroute from the airport. Thanks for everything, we can totally recommend to stay here."

14287680,420577087,2019-03-07,225585688,Celina,"Stavros war ein mega netter Gastgeber. Er hat uns extra von der Metro Station abgeholt, um uns das Kofferschleppen zu ersparen.<br/>Die Wohnung war zentral und nicht mal 5 Minuten weg war ein Supermarkt.<br/>Selbst in der Küche wurde uns Kaffee, Cornflakes und sonstiges was man braucht, aber auch im Badezimmer waren noch Shampoo etc bereit gestellt <br/>Danke!"
14287680,421310565,2019-03-09,100668164,Sarai,Stavros’ Place is the place to stay! Best location just minutes away from the acropolis and sparkling clean. He is such a kind host and even picked us up from our bus stop. Can’t recommend enough. 10/10

14287680,428450134,2019-03-25,232361317,Muriel,"Stavros' apartment is very sweet and practical, perfect for a two-people short-trip to Athens. Everything important to visit was close enough to walk there (around 30-40 minutes), we didn't need to take the train at all. We were really happy about the folder he left there, in which he had stored many brochures for the stay."
14287680,431907401,2019-04-02,950152,Andrea,"Piccolo appartamento in una zona comoda al centro e ai mezzi pubblici. Il quartiere popolare in cui si trova ha tutte le comodità e servizi che possano servire, il lunedì consigliamo un giretto al mercato :) Soggiorno perfetto, Stavros molto disponibile e gentile. Consigliatissimo."
14287680,437793278,2019-04-15,11872666,Samara,"Stavros’ place is exactly how it looks in the pictures. Great value and very clean with everything you need (pots and pans, towels etc). It’s a short walk from all the main sites. There is a limit to how much hot water is available (as Stavros explained to us) so this is something to consider. It was also quite noisy especially early in the morning. Overall we enjoyed our stay in Athens and in the apartment."
14287680,438252411,2019-04-16,239107206,Hanrui,"A really nice flat. Perfect location, convenient transport and you can find everything you need in daily life, I was really surprised by this. A patient and warm host. If I come to Athens again, I will choose this host again!"

14287680,439985036,2019-04-20,23553593,Kelly,This apartment was very conveniently located to downtown Athens/ acropolis 10-15 minutes walking with plenty of places to grab food or coffee along the way. Stravos was very helpful and even picked us up from the airport. He offered many great suggestions on where to go and what to do and made for a very pleasant Athens experience !
14287680,441818603,2019-04-22,137084469,Catherine,Stavros est toujours  disponible pour nous donner des informations! L’appartement était super propre et situé à 15 minutes de marche du quartier animé de Athènes. J’y retournerais sans hésitation!
14287680,442674422,2019-04-24,57573431,Reina,"STAY HERE!! My friend and I stayed at Stavros's place in the beginning and end of our trip to Greece (we went to the islands in the middle) and it was perfect. Stavros was so kind an helpful. He picked me up from the airport and told me fun facts about Athens on the way to the apartment. The place is very cozy and comfortable and is easily walkable to the Plaka and the Acropolis. When Stavros tells you to eat at the place near the school PLEASE LISTEN! It was phenomenal. Wifi was fast, the rooms were clean, and everything was as presented on the website. Thank you, Stavros!!!"
14287680,446398661,2019-05-01,25304264,Farah,"The place is very modern and comfortable. It has all you need for short stay. Suitable for 2 people. Location is near neos kosmos metro station, calm street. Would definitely recommend or book again"

14287680,453903859,2019-05-17,127183659,Mihai,"The place is the same it is in the pictures. Stavros is a good host, always avalaible for any question, and, more than that, he even picked us with his car from a metro station nearby. The location is great, specially for the money, as it is close to the center of Atena, and the area has everything you need. As a minor minus: given the fact that the appartment is on the 1st floor, you can hear some things from the outside. But, if you really enjoy Atena, then you should be too tired to hear that much."
14287680,456348732,2019-05-21,250113280,Emily,"Clean, bright, styled space! Great stay, amazing communication and follow up by the host! Everything you need for a stay in Athens! Thank you!"

14287680,461777615,2019-06-01,71792860,Kelvin,The apartment is well designed and has a great location. Just a few minutes from a metro stop and about a 15 minute walk away from the acropolis. The neighborhood itself is very homely and felt really safe. There are multiple shops and restaurants nearby so you don’t need to go far for nice food and a drink. Stavros was very helpful and made sure we knew everything that we needed to know about Athens before we arrived. I would definitely recommend this apartment for a trip to Athens!
14287680,463413053,2019-06-03,59745119,Sean,Stavros was great! Great communication and very hospitable. Thanks for the great experience and can’t beat the location. Walking distance or short cab ride to all the great things to do in Athens.

14287680,469752055,2019-06-15,71296410,Gilles,"Appartement conforme aux photos et à la description. Bien équipé et très propre.<br/>Accueil chaleureux et aidant de Stavros.<br/>Je recommande vivement.<br/>J'ai fait 2 séjours à Athènes chez Stavros, avant et après la visite de quelques iles. Entretemps, Stavros avait fait poser de nouvelles portes-fenêtres très isolantes.<br/>Donc, des commentaires précédents signalant des bruits importants de la rue ne sont donc plus vrais."
14287680,471727182,2019-06-18,154744203,Liz,"Stavros is a great host - he was good with communication, picked us up from the airport (and waited even though our flight got delayed). Upon arrival to the apartment he showed us how the lock, internet, windows, and air conditioner (bedroom only) worked. The location of the apartment is nice because it is away from the center of the city but you can manageably walk to the Parthenon, plaka, and restaurants. The space is a small apartment but all you need for exploring Athens with a nice place to sleep and relax a little at night."
14287680,473160932,2019-06-21,253151635,Tatjana,"Stavros is a great host. Picked us up from the airport, provided lot of useful local tips. Quick to respond as well. Good location with nearby stores and restaurants, walking distance to Plaka."

The property is within reach of most of the tourist sites in the Athens and as a result, a few minutes walk will get you into the heart of the city.<br/>Nice superhost and I recommend."

14287680,481054728,2019-07-04,264353023,Laura,Stavros was kind enough to pick us up from the airport after a long flight. During our drive he gave us a history lesson and made some recommendations for restaurants within walking distance. The apartment was clean and equipped with everything you need.

14287680,486075547,2019-07-12,222608161,Rina,The apartment was clean and had all the basic amenities you would need. There was air conditioning which was very much needed in the 49 degree heat!<br/>The bathroom was clean and hot water was available.<br/>The apartment is located about 10-15 mins walk from the Acropolis.  Athens is hilly so you'll need good walking shoes.<br/>It's in a residential area so it's quiet at night. There's a bakery very close by which seems to always be open and a mini market about 3 mins walk away.<br/>Be careful with your bags/rucksacks on the metro. Stay vigilant for pickpockets!
14287680,486755343,2019-07-13,110683993,Finn,The appartment was better than expected. Great communication with Stavros too.

14287680,498777530,2019-07-30,28952795,Ana María,El piso tiene todo lo necesario para una estancia perfecta en Atenas. El Barrio donde se encuentra el piso está a 15 minutos andando del centro y a veces la cuesta se puede hacer algo pesada. Pero si no son 6 euros desde el centro en taxi. La cama es cómoda y el aire acondicionado un Must en el verano de Grecia!
14287680,501224164,2019-08-03,14909879,Louanne & Keith,Stavros place is much nicer than it shows in the pictures. It is super clean and the air conditioning in the bedroom allowed us to have a very comfortable sleep in the middle of the hot Athenian summer. It is very easy to get from airport on metro and only 10 euros. Stavros was very helpful when I had my credit card stolen at the tram station and helped me get to the visitor police station. I would especially take his advice on an amazing restaurant just around the corner. It was the best food experiences we had on the trip. Highly recommend this place
14287680,504090354,2019-08-07,40220197,Djeni & Bozo,"Everything was great. Apartment looks exactly like on the pictures and it’s very clean and nice.

Our stay was beyond our expectations because it was clean, quiet and a nice neighborhood! It is walking distance to Plaka by foot and there is a great restaurant at 3 minutes from the apartment that Stavros recommended! He is a great host. He was there at the exact moment we said to get the keys and gave us great tips to discover Athens"
14287680,527638320,2019-09-11,112394770,Karina,"Stavros was very precise and fast with the communication. The check-in was very efficient as well. The apartment was simple but very functional. The location was good, in a quiet and no fancy zone, 10 minutes walking from the Zeus temple. Furthermore, Athens is an incredible city and we had a great time there!"

You feel at home. <br/>It is very convenient and is located in a lively area. There is a supermarket 3 min away by walk, mini markets, and even a local groceries market on monday on the main street :-) Stavros recommended to try the closest bakery for bread, pastries, etc... and we went there every single day!

Allerdings ist die Küche zum Kochen und Sitzen wirklich ziemlich klein. Das Haus ist hallig und die Wände dünn, d.h. unser Schlaf wurde leider hin- und wieder durch laute Nachbarn gestört. Der Kontakt zu Stavros war unkompliziert. Er hat immer schnell und ausführlich geantwortet. Der Check-in per Schlüsselbox war super. Die Wohnung befindet sich ca. 30 Min. zu Fuß vom Zentrum der Altstadt und ein Supermarkt ist 3 Min. zu Fuß entfernt."

Είναι εύκολα προσβάσιμο με τα μέσα μεταφοράς. <br/>Παρά την κεντρική τοποθεσία δεν υπήρχε θόρυβος και μπορούσες να απολαύσεις μια ήρεμη διαμονή.<br/>Ο κύριος Σταύρος είναι πολύ εξυπηρετικός και ευγενικός.<br/>Στα μείον του σπιτιού είναι ότι η εξώπορτα δεν είναι ασφαλείας, κλιματισμός για θέρμανση υπάρχει μόνο στην κρεβατοκάμαρα και το μπάνιο θα μπορούσε να καθαριστεί πιο επιμελώς."
14287680,584584789,2019-12-30,15293088,Avgi,"An excellent value for money! Sparking clean flat, good mattress,  very close to Syggrou-Fix metro station. Stavros was very responsive and helpful."
14287680,600249319,2020-02-01,308246221,Isabelle,"The flat is amazing. It's nicely decorated, you can chill in the living room watch some tv, or you can make a nice delicious dinner in the kitchen, or relax in a hot bath/shower, even invite a few friends over for some quality time, or you can enjoy the comfortable bed and sleep very well. The place is near to all major tourist attractions: the nearby metro takes you easily everywhere, in two stops you can be in syntagma square, then walk to monastraki square, go to museums, the Acropolis, not forgetting the many coffee shops and restaurants.  I went alone, I stayed for almost a month, and I had no problem of safety or otherwise.  I recommend this place completely. I myself am returning as soon as I can.<br/>Thank you, Stavros!!!"
14287680,601687701,2020-02-04,242538856,Demet,"Very nice place, with easy access to all city highlights in friendly and quite neighborhood.<br/>We had perfect communication with our host Stavros, before and during stay with very clear and helping instructions.<br/>Hope to be back!"

The location is great, it is only 15 minutes walk to Acropolis and 5 minutes to the nearest supermarket. I would recommend this flat to everyone."
14287680,613878756,2020-03-03,101926736,Tobias,"I can highly recommend the flat! You can reach the center of Athens by foot in 20 to 30 minutes and even faster with busses or metro. In the neighborhood you find small markets and Bakerys, some good places to eat and to drink and on top of that your host Stavros will answer your questions super fast and friendly. Thanks a lot, we had a good time here."

Κοντά στην Ακρόπολη και δίπλα στο μετρό Συγγρού/Φιξ. Σούπερ μάρκετ και όποιο κατάστημα επίσης σε πολύ κοντινή απόσταση. Το μόνο πρόβλημα είναι ότι η κουζίνα είναι κάπως μικρή, οπότε δεν είναι εύκολο να μαγειρεύεις σε καθημερινή βάση. Όλα τα υπόλοιπα μια χαρά."

Unfortunately that is something from the internet company and has nothing to do with the host who was communicative all the time and tried to call the company and give me a solution. He was nice to change the reservation to only one night. <br/><br/>I was there a single night but I can say that the space was clean and stylish as in the pictures. The location is about 5~10 min walk from the subway station and it was in a quiet residential area. <br/><br/>The AC, water heater, TV, etc... worked fine. <br/><br/>If it was not for the issue of not having internet the whole apartment was as expected and good to stay."

It comes with a great host (Stavros always answers immediately and I booked in a second after he answered my questions); a beautiful, somewhat under the radar, neighborhood, walking distance to the city center and other beautiful neighborhoods such as Mets; and everything you need to feel more at home and less in a Airbnb. Everything was exactly as desribed and shown so all you have to do is enjoy yourself, which is very easy in Neos Kosmos. Thank you, Stavros!"

The apartment is just the right size, very clean, everything as described and seen on the photos, and we loved the AC in the bedroom that cooled us down each day when coming back from strolling around the city. <br/><br/>Location was good too, about 8mins walk to get to the metro or tram station, 15mins tram ride from the nearest beach, restaurants and bars are bit further from the area, but still walking distance and at least you can get a good night sleep as there is no noise coming from the street and just about 3 stops on metro from the centre and tourist attractions. <br/><br/>We would happily stay again if coming back to Athens :)"

Conveniently located near Acropolis with lots of local shops and bars on your doorstep. All clean and tidy and cool and quiet with great double glazed windows. Stavros is a wonderful kind host who has brilliant communication and ensures all sorted ahead of your stay. Also very kindly collected us and took us to his other property nearby in Alimos for our beach stay - which is also wonderful! Highly recommend :)

Make sure to try the bakery just around the corner - amazing products and the closest (big) supermarket is about a 7 minute walk.

Que vous dire sinon que l appartement à été une vraie surprise et fidèle à la description de Kostas , son appart est un bijou et nous avons réellement apprécié y séjourner .tres accessible Kostas vous donnera toutes les infos que vous souhaitez , pour les plus sympa une belle surprise vous attend ! Appartement climatisé et si vous restez plusieurs jours , Kostas pourra vous proposer un trip où vous le souhaiterez, plage, forêt... Fruits et boissons nous ont été offerts à notre arrivée !

Pour info le meilleure pain de la ville au coin de la rue et le poète des sandales dans la rue parallèle ... J y repart en janvier !"

He thought of everything for our arrival going eyond our expectations  ( there was cold water fruits and eggs in the fridge, and we were able to make coffee in the morning, and there was even a cell phone with a Greek number which we could use to call him if we needed anything). Communication was easy and speedy. The studio is centrally located, clean and with a stunning.view.from the terrace. While there is no Internet ( as advertised) there is no need to spend anytime indoors as Athens and it's wonders are right outside. We couldn't have picked a better place for our short stay. We recommend both Kostas and his very central and wonderful studio."

<br/>L'appartement est tout à côté de la grande station de métro, situé dans une rue qui paraît peu commode au premier abord (tag, etc) qui s'avére en fait etre une rue d'artistes, pleine de charme ! Je recommande cet appartement, expérience garenti dans l'ascenseur !"

The only thing is that I will not take my kids with me as I realised there is a lot of night life in this area and I didn't get to see it.<br/>The views from the rooftop terrace are stunning, especially at night.<br/>The flat is cozy, perfect for a few days in the heart of monastiraki. It has all you might need, air con, fan, etc and the kitchen in well equipped.<br/>We didn't get to meet kostas because he was on a trip but we were welcomed by Magda and yanis, two very nice people who helped us out with the luggage, gave us good tips as to what to visit and about local restaurants. They were genuinely willing to help and we really appreciated that.<br/>The building itself might be deceiving as the entrance and the stair case look a bit anarchist but the flat is tidy and very clean.<br/>We recommend this studio 100%"
14297436,101744706,2016-09-15,41248384,Florence,We stayed 2 nights at Kosta apartment. The flat is really nice !!! The situation is ideal in the center of Athens. We have been welcomed by Kosta who is really nice and helpfull !!! Thanks again !
14297436,102376550,2016-09-18,93083967,Karolina,"The apartment was fully equipped, located in the city centre, everything was near by. 
<br/>Communication with Kostas was quick and clear. 
<br/>There is nothing I could complain about, everything was perfect. I recommend it to everyone."
14297436,103160832,2016-09-20,48386165,Bruce,Kostas was very welcoming and helpful - unfortunately the electricity for the building had been disconnected (his apartment was still connected) which meant the lift and lights didn't work so a 4 story climb each time we came home - & in almost complete darkness for the first 2 stories. But we enjoyed our stay anyway! And the view from the roof (another 4 story climb!) is spectacular!
14297436,108399597,2016-10-16,27042780,Nicolas,"L'appartement de Kostas est vraiment très bien situé. Au cœur de Athènes. Nous avons tout fait à pied (Environ 15 kms/jour). L'appartement est propre est bien équipé pour un couple. La Rue, l'ascenseur et la terrasse sur le toit vaut le détour. Bref! Pour le rapport qualité/prix est juste respectable et parfait"
14297436,109206342,2016-10-20,96400753,Kheoma,"Very nice studio close to everything. I was afraid when I saw the street on (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps, but arriving there it can be seen that the graffiti adds a special twist to it. The different lamp shades on the street are also a plus. Magda was so kind to wait for us at the entrance, even though our train was delayed by 20 min. The entrance hall and lift are ok. The studio is quite spacious and have everything that you may need (some snacks, beer, toothpaste, shampoo, kitchen appliances, nice bed...). Magda took us to the roof top and I was shocked. The view is just amazing. My friend and I went to the roof top every time we were free haha Magda also was super kind to share taxi/bus that would run in the night, as our flights were super early.  Location-wise the studio is close to the metro station and MANY restaurants and bars. And also in the middle of all the tourist attractions. Super happy with the experience! :)"
14297436,110252651,2016-10-25,5355303,Viola,"A+ host! Kostas's apartment has a great location and a homey feel. No complaints at all, I would 100% stay here again! Kostas's friend Magda met us upon arrival and was extremely nice and helpful despite the fact that our flight had been significantly delayed and caused us to arrive late. Thank you!"

<br/>The neighborhood is just in the heart of the city, one minute away from Monasteraki Sq. and surrounded by loads of bars and restaurants. The flat was clean, it looked exactly as in the pictures and it is shocking quite plus the views from the roof are amazing. "

Tranquillo, silenzioso e con accesso alla terrazza della palazzina con splendida vista sul Partenone. Il posto è nel centro della movida notturna a due passi piazza Monastiraki. In posizione strategica per muoversi a piedi su tutti luoghi di visita di Atene. Kostas ci ha accolto in modo perfetto dandoci indicazioni utili e mettendo a disposizione la sua cucina e tutto ciò di cui avevamo bisogno. Simo rimasti completamente soddisfatti dell'alloggio."

14297436,143098768,2017-04-10,99620088,Sofie,"Studion ligger ett stenkast fråm Monastirakis tunnelbanestation och är lätt att hitta. Vi blev trevligt mottagna av en vän till Kostas Alexandros och blev visade hur allt fungerade i lägenheten + på takterrassen. Lägenheten var väldigt ren, sängen var bekväm men extrasängen vi fick i stället för den trasiga futonen var inte så skön. Inredningen tilltalar de som gillar rock, kreativitet och anarkism. Det fanns tyvärr ingen wifi i lägenheten.<br/><br/>Vi tog med oss frukosten upp till takterrassen där vi njöt av sol och utsikt, där fanns två stolar och man kunde se större delen av centrala Athen inklusive en perfekt utsikt över Akropolis. <br/><br/>Lägenheten ligger vid en gata där ena änden är ganska förfallen och nedgången medan den andra änden har fräscha renoverade byggnader. Trappuppgången, hissen och de gemensamma utrymmena i huset där studion ligger var ganska nedgångna med en del dunkla hörn och prång. Vi kände oss säkra där men skulle kanske ha känt oss lite otrygga om vi hade varit ensamresenärer. På gatan utanför satt ofta en farbror som vi tror bor i huset, han hälsade glatt och höll koll på vilken lägenhet vi bodde i, det kändes ungefär som att ha en trevlig portvakt. <br/><br/>I närheten ligger fullt med trevliga caféer, restauranger och barer och det är gångavstånd till de flesta sevärdheter."

It is right in the heart of Monastiraki - step outside and you are in the very centre of Athens with everything you could want on your doorstep. The apartment is spacious and funky, the roof terrace has a fantastic view of the Acropolis and however long you go for, you will want to stay longer. Thanks Kostas!! :-) "

Plus he welcomed us and showed us also the terrace - what a view of Acropolis! His street is full of restaurants and bars, walking distance from main spots and close to a subway. The building is an old one which turns into something even more interesting. We had a great time and would definitely stay there again. Again, definitely worth staying. "
14297436,156752961,2017-06-01,12004899,Annika,Kostas place is on the perfect location to see all the main tourist attractions in Athens. We have walked everything. Since it is a full house we made use of the kitchen which was very well equipped. There is a food market around the corner perfect for groceries. 
14297436,157890673,2017-06-05,52819292,Aj,Kostas was a really great host!! On the first day he came and met us at the station and offered us beer once we got to the place :) The apartment has a lot of character and the rooftop view is amazing! (just don't get naked). It is walking distance to everything you need.. Just make sure to watch out for the dragons that live down the street! ;)

It is located on this beautiful funky street in the heart of the city so everything is within walking distance. Cafés, restaurants, Akropolis is all around the corner. We landed around midnight and got to Kostas' place around 1.30 am and he was waiting for us in the flat with a melon in the fridge as a welcoming present. He was always replying very fast and was extremely helpful with everything. The flat itself was tidy and cozy (even have airco for those who cannot stand the greek heat) and I loved the decoration as well. Not to mention the roof top of the building that has a view to the Akropolis. An absolute five star, I will definitely book his place again when I return to Athens which I will surely do. Thanks for everything!"

14297436,174739018,2017-07-27,41985823,Letizia,Alexandros Wohnung ist super zentral; von seiner Wohnung kann man alles zu Fuss erreichen. Die Wohung ist cool und die Dachterasse mit Blick auf die Akropolis läd zum geniessen ein. Einziger negativer aber sehr kleiner Punkt ist; dass die Wohnung kein Internet hat! Wir kommen auf jedenfall wieder.

He was very friendly and offered some good suggestions about where to eat. <br/><br/>The apartment itself was very clean and had a nice breeze along with air conditioning. Everything we needed was provided and we especially enjoyed the roof top where we could have a drink while looking at the Acropolis. All the major tourist attractions were close by so we had no trouble walking everywhere.<br/><br/>Thanks again for having us!"

Despite being in a buzzing neighbourhood the apartment is located in a quiet street. Kostas was very welcoming and even allowed us a later check out."
14297436,191554756,2017-09-08,148204407,Megan,Right in the heart of the city with great rooftop views! The Montasiriki market is just a couple minutes walk down the street which is awesome. It's close to every major attraction so you can walk anywhere without worrying about taking taxis. Shops and bars in the area are also amazing. I'd definitely go back!
14297436,194153354,2017-09-16,142651650,Eric,L'appartement d'Alexandros est tout simplement génial ! Idéalement placé ( à pied : 5 min du métro Monastiraki - 10 min de l'Acropole) dans un quartier à vous couper le (Website hidden by Airbnb) cerise sur le gâteau une terrasse avec vue sur l'Acropole de jour comme de nuit....Alexandros a été aux petits soins tout est prévu pour que vous passiez un agréable séjour....Merci Alexandros!

14297436,196096392,2017-09-22,13678148,Massimo Donato,"I had an amazing stay. Great location. 2 minutes walk from Monastiraki station which makes it very easy to get to Piraeus or to the airport. Quite a bohemian area, with lots of restaurants, many of which tucked away from the more touristy areas nearby. The place was very cosy and spotless clean. Amazing views from the roof top. Kostas is a great host. Thanks a lot."

14297436,198669354,2017-09-30,1037291,Robin,"Our host Kostas was cheerfully waiting to show us his apartment when we arrived past midnight. While the first floor gate of the building, with its graffiti and bohemian vibe might put some off, it's perfectly safe. The studio was clean, comfortable and well stocked with all necessities, including board games if we ever got bored. Its decor also showed his passions in music and boxing. What we will especially miss is the apartment's great location, within 3 minutes walk to the Monastiraki station, which is on the same line as the airport. Within a stone's throw are also Savvas, a great Greek restaurant that serves incredible gyros for under 3€, a popular dessert cafe called Little Kook, bakeries and inexpensive fresh fruit sold by street vendors. The million-dollar  view from Kostas' roof garden of the Acropolis, especially at night, will be something you won't forget in a hurry. We'll definitely stay there again if we're in Athens."
14297436,204876482,2017-10-20,10289056,Christopher,"I had a warm welcome from Kostas and before long, he was informing me of bars that I would like in the area. The neighbourhood has an eclectic bunch of bars, trash n treasure stores, trendy boutiques and great restaurants. <br/>Sitting on the roof in the sun was very special as it has great views of the Acropolis and looks all over athens. The apartment was cozy and more than sufficient for young people/couples. Kostas was generous and I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this hip part of town. Kostas was a brilliant host. Thanks again"
14297436,205315802,2017-10-22,27346783,Simone,Kostas ist ein sympathischer und zuvorkommender Gastgeber . Seine Wohnung hat eine super Läge und ist gemütlich und interessant eingerichtet. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt!!<br/>

The greatest benefit is the central location in a lively neighbourhood full of good restaurants and bars. In the place it is quiet though and it is well shielded against light from outside.

14297436,211109428,2017-11-12,7502066,Rosie,"Kostas flat is in an excellent location. Everything you need is in the area within walking distance.

14297436,220372548,2017-12-22,60409370,David,kostas is a generous host and his apartment did not disappoint! He met us without problem and showed us around his spacious place.  The location is great - right in the middle of everything we wanted to do in Athens. I would highly recommend!!
14297436,222925077,2017-12-31,73577767,Tony,"Amazing, kind guy. Superb apartment. What else can I say!"
14297436,225985152,2018-01-08,27346119,Anestis,"Kostas' studio was exactly as advertised. Even if the atmosphere and the decorations in the room might not be appreciated by anyone, the apartment was tidy and neat. All necessities were there and there was absolutely no problem with hot water or heat (no central such, but the A/C worked just as well). Being greek myself (not from Athens though) and aware of the history of the area where the studio is situated, I was initially a bit concerned about safety issues. And the truth is that the building is not so welcoming from the outside, which is also the case for the common areas (entrance, elevator, staircase). But Kostas was reassuring that the building is safe and nothing serious has ever happened, which turned out to be true. The surrounding streets are flooding with cafes, bakeries and restaurants offering a variety of meal options.<br/><br/>Kostas was an excellent host. Timely communication in view of my arrival in Athens and then very quick response when talking about the details of checking in. He welcomed me with a box of greek christmas cookies and was more than happy to answer my questions. No problems during checkout, even if I left the studio a bit later than 12:00.<br/><br/>In my opinion the most important advantage of Kostas' studio is its location. Literally a stone's throw from the Monastiraki metro station from which you reach the airport in 45-50min! In the heart of the city with lots of options for shopping and eating, I would definitely recommend it to those that spend only a few days in Athens and wish to take advantage of every minute of their visit!"

14297436,276867055,2018-06-15,54037262,Nina,"We loved the apartment!  It’s in the perfect location;  2mins walks from Monastiraki Square Metro (which you can get straight from the airport), really quiet at night for sleeping (we didn’t hear a peep from anyone or anything & slept really well), it’s just literally around the corner from (in our opinion) the best region of central Athens with lots of really nice cafés, bars, restaurants, pretty little squares, & some little artisan shops, & some amazing graffiti which was interesting to see & to try & understand the recent politics.  One of the best restaurants we’ve ever eaten at was a short walk away; Zampano, my god, amazing food, craft beers, large wine selection, selection of tsipouro’s, great service, well worth a visit (breakfast, lunch or dinner!).<br/>The flat is also just a 5-10min walk to the Acropolis and the busier more touristy areas around the Acropolis.<br/>The flat has everything you would need, was clean & comfortable, had a nice shower & felt safe.  We really loved our short stay & would like to come back - if we do we would definitely try to book this apartment again.<br/>We were late arriving due to a delayed flight & the taxis being on strike, but Kostas’ friend Alex was still there to meet us at half past midnight!  Sorry & thank you Kostas!"

14297436,295681426,2018-07-24,54972148,Jean-Luc,L’appartement est idéalement situé pour découvrir Athènes à pied. La vue depuis la terrasse est magnifique. Kostas Alexandros est très accueillant et serviable. Nous garderons un excellent souvenir de ces huit jours passés à Athènes.

The apartment is in an amazing location just off the main shopping strip and 3 minutes walk to Monastiraki station (handy as no changing trains to travel to/from the airport or Piraeus port). Although practically every surface in the laneway the apartment is located in is graffitied, the street is very safe and has plenty of foot traffic due to the Little Kook patisserie (extremely good cakes and their multiple shopfronts are a favorite with (Hidden by Airbnb) users). There’s heaps of different restaurant areas located within a couple of minutes walk.<br/><br/>The apartment is as per the photos and is the most eclectically styled apartment that you’ll likely ever stay in (think pirate and Che Guevara flags, uni student style furniture, extensive record collection, etc) and is very comfortable and probably the most spacious studio Airbnb apartment you’ll find.<br/><br/>We’d happily stay here again."
14297436,473760292,2019-06-22,29427706,Gabby,"We stayed here for 3 nights and had a great time. Location wise it’s perfect - 4 minutes walk to monastiraki station (which is a direct train from Athens airport) and the main square. You can walk to all the major attractions within 15 minutes (acropolis, hadrians arch, agora, etc.) which we did! There are many good options around and a dessert bar right downstairs and it’s round the corner from A for Athens, a bar with one of the best views in Athens. The apartment was very large, clean and well stocked. Whilst it is obvious Kostas does stay here, we nevertheless felt comfortable in the space and it had everything we needed. it’s great value for money right smack in the middle of Athens!"
14297436,476346207,2019-06-26,63190982,Steph,"We sadly didn't get to meet Kostas during our stay but from the great communication to the effortless check in and check out process we couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>From the decor/evident impeccable music taste, you really get a feel for Kostas' home which is truly in the heart of Athens.<br/><br/>Aside from the incredible location, the apartment itself was super spacious. Everything that you need for a great stay is either already in the apartment or within the area and the view from the rooftop was phenomenal.<br/><br/>Thanks again!"
14297436,480695340,2019-07-03,40667768,Jennifer,"Kostas place is very central, with s rooftop view of the acropolis and walking distance to all the main sites as well as being in a cool neighbourhood. The street has a lot of street art which I love and but was a little scary when we checked in at 3am as there were drunk people around. The studio was really clean and has a cool atmosphere and Kostas wrote that we should feel st home and could use anything in the kitchen which was nice. We unfortunately didn’t meet Kostas or have much contact with him, I guess he is travelling, so I can’t say anything about him which is a bit sad as I like to meet the host. However he left us detailed written information. Thanks Kostas!"
14297436,484683554,2019-07-09,125671814,Nathalie,Super emplacement pour ce loft. On peut tout faire à pied et Alexandros prend régulièrement de vos nouvelles. Vraiment top.

На улице рядом кафе и она украшена цветными зонтиками. Есть кондиционер, кофеварка, всё необходимое для приготовления пищи. Станция метро Монастираки и рынок в пешей доступности.

14297436,532711302,2019-09-20,170748264,Lisa,"We unfortunately can't say that we would stay here again. Check in/out was easy enough and the street was conveniently located. The apartment was clean and as pictured, although we had difficulty accessing the roof and it isn't a space for anything more than a photo. The building itself had several missing lights and is rather rundown, which made it feel more unsafe (when combined with the atmosphere of the alley). The toilet malfunctioned during our stay (the flusher button broke, we had to manually flush with a pot of water). Kostas offered a plumber, which we declined, but then communication ended there."
14297436,534738533,2019-09-23,24697542,Jonathan,"Super hôte et super appartement idéalement situé. On se sent bien. Le double vitrage préserve du bruit, et permet d’apprécier être dans un quartier très animé. Le rooftop est un plus pour le petit dej ou prendre un verre, avec une vue exceptionnelle. Je recommande sans hésiter !!"
14297436,543221851,2019-10-07,128036217,Andrew,"I really enjoyed my stay at Kostas’ place. He was very willing to be accommodating of my off-hour arrival time into Athens and provided me with a quick run-through of everything in the apartment when I got there. He also provided good recommendations for restaurants.<br/><br/>The apartment is very nice and extremely close to Monastiraki Square, the jumping off point for many of the tourist activities in the city. Very walkable."

14297436,588223195,2020-01-04,13873357,Andrii,"Все було добре, Костас — гостинний господар. Помешкання чудово розташоване, поряд з метро і недалеко від різних визначних місць. <br/>Ми були тут на Новий рік, і єдиний мінус — в квартирі було холодно. Там є обігрівач, є можливість поставити кондиціонер на обігрів, але це не дуже допомагає. Однак це не вина квартири чи її хазяїна — просто погода була холодною, а в Греції нема центрального опалення. Тож сміливо можемо радити! Дякуємо!"
14297436,590280285,2020-01-08,145799351,혜준,"It was close to everywhere I wanted to such as Acropolis, Plaka, museum, shopping street ect. The area near house is a bit crowded in the day because there's a popular cafe, but it was quiet at night that I could sleep well.<br/>Kostas' place has unique mood that you can't feel in other hostels or hotels. I recommend!"
14297436,594852050,2020-01-19,321159212,Magdalena,The apartment is located in the best location in Athens.

The apartment is located 2 mins from Monastiraki Square and a walkable distance to all popular attractions. Kostas also recommended us to visit the Central Municipal Athens Market where we got to buy some local food at a cheap price. The apartment was generally clean and very stylish, well-lived in. You got everything you needed in the apartment and it had a beautiful rooftop with unparalleled views of the Parthenon. Definitely recommended!"

Il s'agit de sa maison, et on s'y sent bien. Un fan de musique, les amateurs apprécieront !<br/>Les indications pour l'arrivée étaient absolument précises et parfaites, bien anticipées par Kosta, aucun mal à trouver l'endroit et récupérer les clés. Le lieu très vivant et la vue depuis le rooftop incroyable !<br/>Le studio est très spacieux et propre, et la présence d'un ventilateur et de la climatisation nous a été précieuse.<br/>Nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer Kostas mais sommes ravis d'avoir passé deux nuits chez lui !"

The apartment is located in a surprising neighborhood,  with a feeling of old artist quarter.

Although we didn't meet Kostas, he was a very nice host, responding fast to our questions and giving us tips about some nice places to eat around Monastiraki. The apartment is very well equipped with everything you need even with air conditioner. <br/>The building feels a little but old, but enjoying traditional Greek food on the rooftop with a direct view on a well lit Acropolis at night is priceless !"

It's worth noting that there are a lot of things on the apartment as it is obviously normally lived in but if that doesnt bother you I would recommend this place. We loves the location-so easy to nip back during the day and found check in and out super easy!! Great night sleep and provided lots of tips for your stay in athens. ps the pirate Theme goes with the Peter pan themed icecream cafe just outside - which is great to walk past in the eveneing"

Par ailleurs, Alexendros est extrêmement réactif. Nous avons toutefois eu du mal à utiliser l'eau chaude et le chauffage et il n'est pas évident de se garer très près de l'appartement (de nombreux parking sont pleins ou peu pratiques). Nous vous recommandons le parking souterrain de l'Agora, à 15 minutes en métro de l'appartement (10 euros par jour au maximum). Finalement, bon rapport qualité prix."

I enjoyed the well stocked kitchen in the apartment and prepared breakfast daily during my 4 day stay. There is a grocery store 1 minute away from the apartment.<br/>The only drawback was the bathroom shower. It was broken and leaked water into the rest of the bathroom. I laid out a few extra shower mats on the floor and it was fine after that.<br/>Overall I had an enjoyable stay and would return!

We<br/>enjoyed having our breakfast and evening drinks there. <br/>The location is unbeatable, the beautiful neoclassic building is on a lovely quiet square in the heart of Athens. Plenty of great restaurants, cafes and bars within walking distance and literally 10 meters away from the shopping district. Although there are two metro stations 5 mins away, we visited all major tourist attractions on foot. <br/>Anna's tips were spot on, she was a wonderful host, always available and answered my questions promptly. I will definetely stay here on my next visit to Athens!"

<br/>The house was clean and pretty big for the 2 of us, and also the rooftop with a view of the Parthenon is a nice touch!
<br/>On our last day we had trouble with our flights being cancelled although our hosts couldn't accomodate us for the additional day they were very communicative and tried to help us out in every way while we were stuck at the Airport, having someone to talk to on in an unfamiliar place was very comforting in that stressful situation.

14355410,110064835,2016-10-24,18101500,Susanna,"Tämä asunto oli todella kiva :) Parasta melkeinpä oli asunnon sijainti. Se sijaitsi käytännössä pääkadun vieressä, mutta rauhallisella kadulla sisäpihan puolella. Todella viehettävä sijainti, alakerrass kahvila ja kiva ravintola ja lähistöllä hurja määrä ihania kahviloita, baareja ja kauppoja.
<br/>
<br/>Asunto oli todella siisti ja hyvin varusteltu. Kaikki oli niin kuin pitikin olla ja melkeinpä enemmän. Kattoterassi oli tosi siisti ja kiva ja netti toimi myös siellä. Näkymät Akropolikselle hienot :) 
<br/>Asunto oli kivasti sisustettu ja omistaja oli jättänyt meille todella hyvää itsetehtyä viikunahilloa ja ohjeet miten keittää kahvi kreikkalaisittain briki-pannulla. Kiva lisä! Ainoa miinus oli sunnuntai-aamuna melu viereisestä asunnosta klo 08:00 jossa tehtiin remonttia, mutta se ei tietenkään ole omistajan käsissä."

Communication was easy and Anna answered all of our question.  I would definitely stay here again!! "

Despite it's central location, the apartment was nice and quiet at night. <br/><br/>Anni & Efi were great hosts, with a booklet of spot-on suggestions for local restaurants. The two rooftop terraces were a nice plus - having coffee (which they also provided!) overlooking the city was a wonderful way to start the day. Highly recommended."
14355410,162001014,2017-06-19,17646417,Alexander,Excellent accommodation in the heart of Athens. Walking distance to pretty much anywhere you would want to go. Plus the hosts are very amicable and accommodating. They made sure that our trip was a great one. Highly recommended!
14355410,166362469,2017-07-03,11264960,Geoff,"Anna and Efi's place was perfect for my wife and I to access great restaurants as well as visit the Acropolis and museums.  We stayed during a heatwave (45-46 C) and the air conditioning in the apartment was wonderful.  The apartment is spacious with a large private terrace, and the building's rooftop terrace has a great view of the Acropolis (beautiful at night).  We would recommend the apartment to anyone traveling through Athens."
14355410,169346112,2017-07-12,29407386,Eva,Well taken care space by people who make you feel comfortable. Great spot if you enjoy city life!
14355410,170653234,2017-07-16,1263583,Eric,Anna and Efi's place was amazing.  So close to everything in Monasteraki!  There were numerous options for food shopping nightlife all within walking distance.  The best part was how quiet the location was.  It was tucked away from all the noise in a quaint alley.  The views were also incredible... the Parthenon was so close!  We spent quite some time upstairs admiring the view.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet getaway with all the amenities of a lively city!
14355410,171877327,2017-07-19,23414885,Daniel,"Probably the nicest Airbnb I've stayed in. Clean, modern and in the heart of the city. Everything is within walking distance, including bars, restaurants, the Acropolis and other sites in the centre of Athens.<br/><br/>Especially liked this apartment (3) because it has a private balcony!"
14355410,177006895,2017-08-01,13568469,Ben,What a great place to stay!  Close to everything. We had our 1.5 year old toddler  and he loved roaming the patio while we drank a glass of wine at night before bed.  Would definitely stay there again!
14355410,181700293,2017-08-13,22607873,Wajma,"Highly recommended !! The ap is exactly as like the description says. Anna & Efi are very nice and easy to talk with. <br/><br/>You ll find a small catalogue with many advices, location and restaurants. <br/><br/>The location of the place is perfect and you will find everything you need   <br/><br/>Thank you again ! <br/><br/>Emma "
14355410,185995055,2017-08-23,16066974,Thessy,Our favourite place to stay in Athens!
14355410,191973107,2017-09-09,59311478,Mauricio,"El apto está en una ubicación inmejorable. Impecable, cómodo y de fácil acceso. Las anfitrionas siempre estuvieron pendientes de nuestra llegada y aunque no tuvimos el placer de conocerlas( por nuestra llegada a la madrugada), todo lo tenían organizado.<br/>Gracias por estar atentas!"
14355410,193551882,2017-09-14,5861332,Liana,You can't beat the location of this apartment. It's a 2 second walk to the main shopping street and great bars and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Athens.
14355410,196727618,2017-09-24,30933862,Maggie,This was one of the best decisions we made on our trip to Athens! The apartment is exactly as pictured and absolutely lovely. It's in the center of everything but the apartment itself was very quiet. Overall a great experience!
14355410,199827644,2017-10-03,6368671,Eva,"Das Appartment war ein echter Traum. Die Lage ist absolut zentral, man kommt fußläufig zu allen Sehenswürdigkeiten, aber auch die kleinen charmanten Shops, Galerien und versteckten Plätze sind nicht weit.  Und trotzdem ist es oben ruhig und entspannt. Das Rooftop und der Balkon sind der Hammer, auch die Ausstattung des Appartments lässt nichts zu wünschen übrig."
14355410,213818295,2017-11-23,6383376,Dimitris,"Excellent location, space, and host in Athens city center. Within walking distance you can reach almost everything in Athens. If you're traveling to the city of Athens then most probably that's the right place for you. My favorite bar ever ""Baba au Rum"" is around the corner which is a Must! Make sure to stop for a cocktail at this awarded bar. Plaka, Monastiraki, Psyrri just 5 minutes walking distance. A supermarket, dozens of bars, restaurants, coffee places. Wish I could stay longer. Anna & Efi are simply the best! Thank you for this great stay."
14355410,221939725,2017-12-28,29407386,Eva,Great hosts and location! Cozy flat!
14355410,229889508,2018-01-26,160050623,Adeeb,"This apartment is simply a dream! It's in the perfect location, right in the center of Athen, and yet it is quiet, charming, and serene. It felt like my home away from home for three weeks. The veranda is as wonderful as it looks, and the apartment itself is bright and clean with all the necessary amenities for a comfortable stay (including a work table). Anna and Efi are amazing hosts—responding within minutes with warmth and generosity. Athens is a magical city, and this is the best apartment to enjoy all it has to offer. I can't wait for my next stay. Thank you for everything, Anna and Efi!"
14355410,247656967,2018-03-29,78648008,Roger,"The apartment was great-comfortable and spacious. So much better than a hotel room. Efi was very responsive with communications. She arranged for a drive from the airport to the apartment, which took away the stress of getting into town. Check-in and check-out were very easy.  Apartment is located close to everything, but the neighborhood is not particularly loud. Rooftop terrace overlooking the Acropolis is amazing. Overall, I highly recommend."
14355410,249515549,2018-04-02,2196031,Nicolas,"Really good. Very professional, kind &   reactive"
14355410,250155278,2018-04-04,46444748,Marisa,Highly recommended . We will back
14355410,254295907,2018-04-16,10884609,Andre,"Das Apartment hat unsere sowieso schon hohen Erwartungen noch übertroffen. Wir kennen Athen sehr gut, insofern hatten wir nicht sehr viel Sightseeing geplant. Wenn ihr aber nach Athen kommt, um die Sehenswürdigkeiten zu besuchen, seid ihr hier perfekt aufgehoben. Alle Stadtviertel in der City sind in 5 - maximal 20 Minuten Laufweite (Kolonaki, Monastiraki, Exarchia, Prirri, Syntagma). Alle Einkaufsmöglichkeiten vor der Tür, Café 3m, Restaurant 5m usw. <br/><br/>Die Ausstattung ist super, die Terrasse groß - und von der Dachterrasse hat man einen Superausblick auf die Akropolis. Trotz der zentralen Lage ist das Apartment absolut ruhig. <br/><br/>Die Kommunikation, sowie Check-In und -Out waren super problemlos. Alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen."
14355410,256632382,2018-04-23,4844587,Gilles,"Bel appartement, propre, terrasse très sympathique. Emplacement idéal."
14355410,259057772,2018-04-30,56741414,Aurélie,"Ce logement est parfait pour un séjour à Athènes. L'accueil d'Efi, qui parle bien français, a été super. L'appartement, conforme aux photos,  est très calme et pourtant très bien situé (en plein cœur de la ville). Les terrasses sont très agréables.<br/>L'appart est également bien équipé (lits confortables, clim, cuisine bien équipée, Netflix pour la TV...). Le lave-linge commun à l'immeuble est un vrai plus pour les longs séjours. Enfin, les petites attentions d'Efi et Anna viennent parfaire le séjour.<br/>Je conseille vivement cet appartement!"
14355410,260803555,2018-05-05,160500737,Aubree,"Efi + Anna's place is clean, stylish and so well located! My husband and I arrived late (2am) after a flight, the place was so easy to find, we were of course starving and didn't know what if anything would be open at that late hour. Anna + Efi had a very concise booklet that led us to a place called Hot Hot Burger that was open 24hrs, very close by, affordable, and SO GOOD! <br/>The apartment itself was right in the heart of everything, exactly where you want to be to get to all of the main attractions! We really wish we could have stayed here longer and plan to come back!"
14355410,261864578,2018-05-07,146009527,Shelby,We loved our stay here! It was a cute place in the perfect location!
14355410,263120642,2018-05-11,76847516,Carolyn,"This is one of the best Airbnb experiences I have ever had! Anna & Efi's tag line is a home away from home and it is so true. Communications were quick and excellent, even down to organising taxi pick up from the Port and to the airport. The beds were comfy, lots of space and the rooftop balcony with view is stunning.  Kitchen had everything and lots of Restaurants near by.  There was no need for us to get metro tickets as all the sights were within eady walking distance. Highly recommend for families and couples."
14355410,264928458,2018-05-15,63119178,Doreen,"Sehr schönes Apartment in sehr zentraler Lage zwischen Syntagma und Monastiraki. Das Highlight sind die zwei Terrassen, einmal eine private, direkt an der Wohnung und eine weitere im 5. Stock, von welcher man direkt auf die Akropolis blicken kann. Die Kommunikation mit Anna und Efi hätte nicht besser sein können, sie waren immer sofort erreichbar und haben alles getan, damit wir uns wohlfühlen. Es hab sogar ein paar Kleinigkeiten zum Frühstück :) Wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt und ich würde diese Wohnung zu 100% weiterempfehlen!"
14355410,267648670,2018-05-22,6768801,Yossi,"After spending an entire week at Anna and Efi's place, I am happy to recommend it with much enthusiasm.  The location is nothing short of perfect.  Central and within walking distance to all of the sites that most tourists would want to explore in a first or second visit to Athens.  In close proximity to the apartment are several super-markets, tons of restaurants, cafes, and shopping opportunities.  If you're into fitness, there's a Holmes Place just five minutes from the apartment.<br/><br/>The apartment is exactly as shown on the web-site. Better still, it is so quiet, I slept like a baby.  Even light sleepers will find the bedroom extremely quiet with no outside noise whatsoever.   This was a major plus for me. <br/><br/>Without hesitation, I'd book this place again next time I'm in Athens."
14355410,268155663,2018-05-24,7970747,Paul,"Thanks to Anna and Efi for a great way to experience Athens. <br/><br/>The apartment is in a perfect place to walk to everything - Acropolis /Acropolis Museum, all the great bars and restaurants of Syntagma and Psyri. It’s also easy to get to the port by Metro. Everything you need for a great short break in a fabulous city. <br/><br/>Anna and Efi also left us a great homemade guide to everything in the area. Some great suggestions of where to eat and have fun. <br/><br/>Have to also mention Lazoros who offers a brilliant/friendly/knowledgable pick up/drop off for the airport and ferry terminal. <br/><br/>We would totally stay here again. <br/>Thanks! <br/>Paul and Matt."
14355410,273194079,2018-06-05,7388995,Rachel,"Beautiful apartment centrally located with everything one could need for a comfy stay. Lovely and helpful hosts, also a great driver to and from the airport named Lazarus who was helpful. Highly recommended! "
14355410,276570488,2018-06-14,185206331,Jacob,"This home is amazing!  It was our favorite place we stayed while traveling through Europe.  Very nice place, clean, had everything we needed, great view of the Acropolis, very quite, but close to lots of restaurants and bars.  In a safe area as well.  Great value for the price!  I would recommend this home to anyone visiting Athens!"

14355410,288965801,2018-07-11,60505672,Linshan,Anna & Efi’s space is conveniently located in the heart of Athens. The private balcony and rooftop terrace make for amazing views of the beautiful city and the apartment is clean and chic. Thanks so much for the stay! 
14355410,297071006,2018-07-27,79584615,Polina,The location is amazing. Everything is near by and you can see the Acropolis from the roof top patio. It also has an amazing size balcony where you can sit and enjoy the outdoors.

14355410,308363783,2018-08-16,157341837,Ana,Alojamiento correcto con buena ubicacion. 
14355410,315627233,2018-08-29,536563,Graham,Fantastic place and especially accommodating hosts. Anna & Efi made our stay in Athens feel like home. Rely on them for great recommendations of places to eat and things to see!
14355410,320544334,2018-09-09,181895544,Diane,"Anna and Efi's apartment is so well appointed! The kitchen was well stocked with toaster, coffee pot, etc. The patio was a delight for breakfasts, and the rooftop terrace and view of the Acropolis was fantastic! The apartment is within walking distance of many sights, as well as shopping and eating. Anna and Efi were gracious hosts and we had a delightful trip to Athens!"
14355410,322059628,2018-09-12,213991779,Evangelia,"This place is amazing! I've spent a lot of time in Greece and I have to say this has been one of the best places I've stayed in Athens.  It is literally steps away from the main shopping street in Athens, big in space and relaxing in decor. I stayed for a few days while I also had to do work and it was quiet, the internet worked great, and I spent a ton of time just sitting on the private terrace (which was my favorite part, second only to the location).  Other than  the shops, there are restaurants on practically every corner nearby and a supermarket just a few small streets away. Also very close to a few metro stops, and of course right next to Plaka, the beautiful historic district, and the Acropolis (like the other reviewers say -- you have to check out the shared roof garden; the view is stunning!). I intend to stay at Anna and Efi's place every time I need to make a few-days' trip to Athens.<br/><br/>PS -- These ladies are extremely sweet, responsive, and attentive."
14355410,326838763,2018-09-23,21785792,Jacob,"This is the spot you want to book.  Perfect location and the host's have really thought of every detail you can think of!  Largest and nicest space we have had in our European travels so far, if this place is available, book it!"
14355410,330120159,2018-09-30,183207495,Marcus,"Absolutely amazing place, the view was stunning. The location is great as well, right in the middle of everything. There are many amazing restaurants in walking distance, there is one right out side of the front door Feedel Urban Gastronomy. I am more than pleased with the location, cleanliness, hosts, driver and the design of the apartment. Hosts were able to provide a driver to pick us up from the airport(extra Cost), just a really special feeling.  I would love to visit again, nice quiet area. This is a great place compared to hotels, brought only half the clothes we needed and did laundry there.  Stunning just stunning"
14355410,334474012,2018-10-09,8052026,Sebastian,"This place was in great area with a good coffee shop and a classy restaurant next door. it was very close to all the main activities and had a great rooftop view of the Parthenon. It was clean and the check-in was absolutely easy to follow and quick. We would have liked to have had more toiletries as the provided toiletries were not enough for the seven day stay. All in all, the location, the facilities, the host and the ease of use were fantastic. This would be an excellent choice."

What a great city break in Athens we just had, and mainly because Anna and Efi’s place was in such a good location.<br/>But on top of location, the place was very accurately described, their hospitality and communication was top notch.<br/>We stayed with our teenage daughter and it was perfect.<br/>Highly recommend!"
14355410,343588475,2018-11-01,83576812,Philippe,The apartment is according to the description and pictures. Ideally located for visits and nighlife and at the same time silent at night. Hosts are gentle and very reactive in case of requirement. A great first visit of Athens !
14355410,346285339,2018-11-08,30764845,Natalie,Great flat in a hip area with everything one would need.  The hosts responded quickly and efficiently and provided a great guide full of local tips and destinations.

14355410,442725512,2019-04-24,245539159,Ira,"We LOVED the apartment! We came with an almost one-year-old baby and Anna & Efi got us a crib and a high chair. There was a lot of space, all the amenities were great. The apartment is nice, cozy and in the best location possible."

The location was great, very close to sites in Athens and many restaurants and shops. The apartment was very clean as listed and Anna responded quickly. She even helped set up a pick up from the port late at night who then helped us check-in. We would definitely return one day!"
14355410,454451164,2019-05-18,78730975,Katie,"Anna and Efi's apartment was the perfect place to stay in Athens. It was a large apartment with a spacious balcony area for eating and access to a great upstairs terrace with a beautiful view of the Acropolis, especially at sunset/night. The apartment is beautifully designed and very clean. The bed was comfortable and with the air conditioner on we were easily able to tune out the clubs down the street on Friday night. The kitchen was well stocked, but it is so close to so many delicious places to eat we didn't need to use it much. Having access to laundry upstairs and Netflix was a nice touch. We hope to stay again!"
14355410,457991666,2019-05-25,6768801,Yossi,"This is an amazing location to explore Athens from. Central, close to restaurants, Ermou pedestrian street, supermarkets, transportation, gym.  And yet - very quiet, especially in the bedroom, where it counts the most."
14355410,463464782,2019-06-03,55964121,Selina,"Anna and Efi’s apartment is very comfortable and large. The location is excellent. We could walk to all the sites, shopping and restaurants. The hosts were very helpful in arranging our airport transfers. Check in/ out were very smooth. They were very quick to respond. We enjoyed our stay in Athens due to the great location. The private terrace with our apartment and the shared rooftop terrace were a great feature."

I'd stay there again anytime."
14355410,499191601,2019-07-31,31643990,Rania,"It’s the equivalent to a 5-star hotel stay in Athens! In the heart of the city, steps away from pretty much anything you can think of: restaurants, attractions, supermarket, shopping... The apartment is spotless clean and well decorated. Anna and Efi were very helpful, kind and super responsive. They arranged transportation, provided tips, offered help and delivered.  I am hard to satisfy and can’t fault the place, we’ll be back for sure!"
14355410,596257526,2020-01-22,19996226,Alex,Wonderful hospitality and great location. Very convenient for a couple or a family and Anna and Efi’s guides to Athens are very useful.

14355410,647268189,2020-08-06,30202754,Jane,"Love this place as it is well located in the heart of Athens. Spacious living and dining area with our own balcony plus we could see the Acropolis from the rooftop which was a bonus! The apartment was very clean and was thoughtfully furnished, also had basic cooking items like oil, salt and pepper and coffee and tea!  Check-in and check-out was easy, Anna was very responsive and friendly! Would recommend to our family/friends travelling into Athens."
14355410,653057524,2020-08-18,7926230,Yasmine Et Sami,"Superbe séjour. Appartement calme, propre et aéré, bien soigné. La terrasse est très agréable. L'appartement est très adapté pour une famille avec bébé et parfaitement situé. Anna a été disponible pour répondre à nos questions pour l'arrivée et pendant le séjour.<br/>Par contre, notre séjour s'est mal terminé car nous avions convenu d'un horaire pour le check out avec Effi et Anna mais au dernier moment, les hôtes ont avancé d'une heure et nous ont demandé de quitter l'appartement plus tôt que ce qu'elle nous avait accordé. Nous avons donc fait notre possible pour libérer l'appartement au plus vite mais la femme de ménage est arrivée, nous a chassé de l'appartement avec agressivité, sans dire bonjour et sans aucune humanité ni pitié a lors que nous étions avec un bébé et sur le point de partir. Nous avons été choqués par cette façon dont elle nous a traités."
14355410,657191769,2020-08-28,49928087,Maria,"The apartment was beautiful with a stunning private and shared rooftop terrace we used for breakfast and in the evening. The location of the apartment is amazing. While you are in the center of Athens the apartment is surprisingly quiet due to its location at a small square with a little cute church. Everything you need is in walking distance, from coffee shops to dining, shopping and supermarkets. It is a perfect stay for discovering Athens. Anna & Efi are super helpful with everything and amazing hosts."
14355410,661993428,2020-09-08,186464686,Holly,Great place. Hosts were extremely easy to communicate with and everything was hassle free. Roof terrace was great to sit outside and eat dinner with a glass of wine. Exceeded our expectations.
14355410,668374765,2020-09-27,243257192,Marian,Really enjoyed the wonderful apartment. It was really clean and stylish. The balcony was amazing (and huge).

The balcony is great but the rooftop has the most incredible view of the acropolis! We had such an amazing stay and the view was so spectacular that my boyfriend chose to propose to me there instead of another location in Greece he had planned. I obviously highly recommend this lovely flat and lovely hosts Anna and Efi!<br/>Thank you! We will remember our stay forever!"

There’s nothing bad to say about the host as well as the location. You can walk and find anything from here. The host was super nice when we arrived early and allowed me to drop bags and explore the city. Walk out the flat and there’s a really cool cafe and place to eat. Couldn’t have asked for a better place in Athens to spend. 5 STARS!!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
14355410,417778952926846320,2021-07-30,164387782,Rachel,"Anna and Efi’s apartment is ideally located just off Ermou Street. The acropolis view is second to none, and the apartment itself...where do I begin? The decor is smart, great black and white photos of old Athens, comfy bed, up-to-date appliances, and perfect water pressure in the shower. Anna and Efi are incredibly accommodating, too — we had to ship an emergency parcel from home to Athens during our stay, and they were super helpful in assisting us with delivery arrangements. Can’t recommend this place enough — for the location, interior decor, comfort, and lovely hosts."

In walking distance from the Acropolis and so many bars and restaurants, we loved our stay. The apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable. The two patios were awesome - amazing views from the roof! There’s a great neighborhood guide in the apartment to help you choose what bars, restaurants ans shops to visit. Anna and Efi helped organize our transfers to and from the airport and helped us find a pharmacy for our covid re-entry test! Very helpful and a wonderful stay. Thank you for everything!"

Starting off with the location, it was in the best part of Athens, close to so many sights, shops, and restaurants. The apartment itself looked just like it did in the photos! Everything was super clean, well maintained, and had great views. Anna was a great host, easily accessible and would respond very quickly to help us with any questions that we had. We also had Anna’s driver, Lazaros, take us to and from the airport and he was the best! He also gave us great advice to get the most out of the city. We would definitely stay here again, and recommend this apartment to anyone who is looking to visit Athens!"

We especially loved the large up-to-date shower after staying at some places with tiny showers. Bathroom was larger and more modern than others we experienced in Greece.   It was great having a washing machine upstairs and the large drying rack to put on the outdoor space. Very clean and comfortable.   Convenient location to metro, though we were close enough to walk almost everywhere.   We would definitely stay there again."

We thought this place had a lot of space but we’re still pleasantly surprised to find it had even more space than we thought. A very comfortable bed in a room that stays dark and cool in the Athens heat. We slept so well here! Fast WiFi, natural light, and cozy yet still beautiful. Cannot stress enough that this is the best location you could ask for. It’s 2 minutes from Montasaki Square, Pssri restaurants, 10 minutes to Acropolis and anything else you would need. We could easy enjoy restaurants and night life with a 5 minute or less walk back to our quiet space. We will stay here again for sure!"

14359675,221625584,2017-12-27,38940899,Jennifer,"We had an amazing time on our Christmas honeymoon in Athens thanks to Panagiotis being such a fantastic host. He was helpful, kind and polite, offering lots of great advice about how to get the most out of our trip to Athens. The apartment was wonderful, spotlessly clean, with beautiful views and a lovely swimming pool.  Thanks again for a great stay."
14359675,251166691,2018-04-07,158587035,Chr,"Great place at the top of Athena. I was like a King. Great place, pool, Athens 360 view. Thank you Airbnb, we have the possibility to live in such a dreamy villas. It was a bit expensive for me, but I filled up several of my batteries for a few days.Very Kindly Host."
14359675,320055347,2018-09-08,182967881,Pat,"Panagiotis was a very honest and kind man. We were unable to stay with him because we had an older friend with us and she was unable to climb the stairs without railings.  He was a very  honorable,gracious ,and and understanding man. He actually helped us find another place to stay.  Mr. Panagiotis’ home was clean and the pool looked inviting. I would recommend this place for anyone that can climb stairs easily and that doesn’t need two separate bedrooms."
14359675,463461209,2019-06-03,244031302,Daniel,"Everything about staying with Panos exceeded my expectations. The house is beautiful and secure in a quiet neighborhood. There is all the natural light and air you'd ever need from the many panoramic windows and doors in the house. The pool is beautifully maintained. It was the smallest but dirty when we arrived, and Panos took the time to drain and thoroughly cleant the next morning for us. The van driver he had meet us at the airport was well worth his weight in gold. It's very nice to have someone who knows where he's going.<br/><br/>While we were there, Panos even provided us with a mobile hotspot so we could have internet anywhere in Athens. Even with a robust international data plan from the USA, my phone had trouble keeping connection in Athens, and the hotspot helped.<br/><br/>We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. It is close to everything. He is very thoughtful and provides a beautiful setting to enjoy Athens from."
14359675,500349814,2019-08-02,96316650,Lene,Skønt sted med kun få minutter til byen i taxa. Pris max. 6 euro pr. vej. Dejligt med mulighed for en dukkert i poolen når man kommer hjem om eftermiddagen. Huset har alt hvad man har behov for. Kontakt til værten var mere end i top - ekstrem venlige og betænksomme.
14359675,561868204,2019-11-10,129422157,Anthony,Panos and his son George were awesome!<br/>The location is great just a short 5-10 euro ride to the city in a taxi. Also many local flavors and suggestions made by them. My wife and I loved the villa. We were able to wash laundry and enjoy the pool with the gorgeous views of Athens! I pray we are blessed enough to come back and we will defiantly try to stay here again. Also George and Panos offered help 24/7 in placing orders for food etc! Thanks for being like family!

14359675,426575905911440511,2021-08-11,400889519,Giulia,"The House Is very clean. If you have any questions just write Panayiotis and he will answer you every question you have. He is a very nice host and you will love his house. A driver came to pick us up from the airport. The Pool was the Highlight of the House, my husband and I enjoyed the pool every day and only left the house in the evening for taking a walk in the city or to eat something. Just a 5 minutes walk from the apartment you will find a 24 h shop, where you can buy everything you need. Panayiotis will give you much Tips for Restaurants, just try it. We went to Zonars restaurant and it was really good food and nice view, but it’s expensive. If you don’t want to spend much money for food you can find very much restaurants in the city. With Taxi it’s only 5-6 € to the City, just stop at Syntagma and You are there. A tip from us: Go to Piräus, there you can find a Lot of cheap and good Fish Restaurants and Listen do the Ocean , to get there it’s 12-15€ with Taxi. <br/><br/>Thank you for Everything we had a great time, we hope we can come back one time "

The location is great from a proximity to metro and Omonia square.  Be aware there are a large number of homeless folks on this street.  We had no issues with the homeless, just something to be aware of from a comfort perspective.   Great host with great local info as well."

It is spacious, well decorated with everything one might need including a variety of coffee and shower gel.<br/>Don't be scared by the people down on the street. We never felt unsafe. We walked everywhere as it is walking distance from alternative lots-of-cool-restaurants Exharchia, to good food good bars Keramikos and trendy Kolonaki. Also walking distance to the center and Akropolis. Use the metro only if you don't like to walk.<br/>Our stay was perfect, good value for money and hope it's free when we're back in Athens.<br/>Thank you Kate and your sisters for the hospitality and making us feel very welcome in Athens"

This studio has everything that one may need: a fully equipped kitchen, a large studying/working space, lots of places to deposit things, a nice and cute terrace, and a very big and spacious closet :). The location is perfect, a short walking distance to the main attractions in the city, very close to the Omonia metro station and a lot of shops. The place is peaceful and quiet.

So many special touches. Everything was clean and in great working order. Internet was strong and stable about 35MBps on average over the course of my 7days there. AC was great. The elevator was quick and easy. Everything was great and then there were plenty of special touches. <br/><br/>Super nice time there. <br/>The location is the geographic center of the city. Locals think it’s dangerous, but it’s not. <br/>There is graffiti, homeless and drug addicts in the area. I walked around at all time and never felt unsafe.<br/>Kate will give great advice on sightseeing without trying to sell you anything. <br/><br/>Overall , a great place for a digital nomad"

Nikos wrote everything for emergency in case we needed it.  However, If you don't know anything about Athens, it was possible to Text him and he reply very quickly. Close to his apartment, there is a supermarket to buy your own food and  there are some restaurants as well.

The neighborhood is a popular one, close anyway to the center, and I think it is slowly  developing : I noticed some more bar and Kafenio even in the night. The local beautiful market, Psaradon road, is not far and it is a simple great experience of greek life. The apartment is big enough and well furnished, Air condition even in the middle of September was necessary! Niko is a host of incredible kindness and precision."

The space was really clean and tidy and we absolutely loved it. The train station was super close too! We definitely recommend Nikos' place if you're in Athens!"

14411271,101440288,2016-09-13,2744484,Charles,"This was my first experience with an AirB&B. I stayed for a month and enjoyed it very much. Karina was an excellent hostess, and the apartment was just what I required. The whole apartment, towels, and linen were very clean. The cosy kitchen had a coffee maker and had everything needed to make small meals (which I rarely did). I appreciated the small washing machine in the bathroom (typically Greek in that it is sparse and small). On the roof you can see the Acropolis (1.7 miles) lit up at night. You'll find everything that you need right downstairs. There are several cafes in the square and plenty of coffee and sandwich/pizza shops right below the apartment. There are two small supermarkets in and around the square and a larger AB supermarket a half mile away. I am a lover of city and urban life and this location was perfect for that.  The neighborhood of Exarchion Square is a short walk away and a funky and hip place to hang out at night. Try ΑΤΙΤΑΜΟΣ ΜΕΖΕΔΟΠΩΛΕΙΟ on Kapodistriou for delicious and inexpensive Greek food and wine.  For tourits, the archeology museum is a short walk away. The Viktoria Square metro station is steps away. Syntagma is three stops away and Monterstarki only two stops. I chose to walk in the pleasant weather."

<br/>Мы с мужем прожили тут один месяц.
<br/>Уютно, чисто, красиво, есть все необходимое для того, что-бы чувствовать себя как дома. 
<br/>Рядом с историческим центром Афин. Станция метро расположена около дома, а за углом дома автобусные остановки, так, что проблем с транспортом нет никаких и можно доехать куда угодно: вышел из подъезда и сразу в метро.
<br/>Но мы  почти не пользовались общественным транспортом, так как все достопримечательности находятся в пешей доступности от этого дома и пройтись по улицам Афин - это прекрасная прогулка с удовольствием.
<br/>Недалеко от дома есть разные кафе, супермаркеты и овощной выездной рынок , который работает по средам, где продают свежайшие фрукты и овощи.
<br/>Хозяйка квартиры милая, приятная, общительная и очень отзывчивая, всегда поможет и расскажет.
<br/>Мы чувствовали себя , как дома.
<br/>Спасибо большое за гостеприимство и любезность!"

The apartment has everything that you need and I just love this apartment. Karina is always available to answer if I have any questions, and want my stay to be as good as possible.

Location is brilliant - very close to the metro but also quiet; walkable to the centre; shops, bars and restaurants on the doorstep.

The neighbourhood is lively with bakery,  supermarket,  clothing, shoes shop etc.  At night it is quiet. The home is very clean. We felt very much at home. Whatever needed in the home can be found. On the first night the fan was faulty. Karina had it replaced after she was informed. She is very prompt in communication.  Fortunate to be able to meet her in person during check in.  Tank you so much Karina for hosting us."

14414976,106076968,2016-10-04,69774867,Nikhil,Kostas is a fantastic host. Right from the communication we received before arrival to meeting us when we arrived and getting us settled in. The apartment is well suited for 5-6 people and is well located to the key tourist locations in Athens as well as across the road from several bars/ restaurants and a very lively part of the city. Getting cabs is easy and the suburban metro is very close to the apartment. The apartment was well kept with good interiors and made our stay extremely comfortable. 
14414976,113896443,2016-11-14,69776675,Kate,"Location is fantastic!! A quick few minute walk from the Metro, Kerameikos stop, and easy to navigate to all of the ""must-see"" spots in the city. Giannis and Dimitri were very responsive and helpful throughout the stay, including having an extra bed made up (the couch is a pullout as we had 5 adults) and replacing a hairdryer within 20 minutes. Giannis was willing to answer any questions and took the time to show on the map where we were and how to get to the ""hot spots"". Everyone was very hospitable, the apartment was immaculately clean and everything was as shown in photos, including the incredible view of the Acropolis from the shared rooftop. While there are 4 units in the building, we did not spot anyone else the entire stay. The apartment is on a busy road so there is traffic noise throughout the night and the beds (master and twins) are on the firm side, my friend said the pullout was soft, though I did not have a problem sleeping after all the walking and touring! I would definitely stay here again! "

La posizione è comodissima alla metropolitana, il quartiere è residenziale ma molto vivo di notte, anche se da dentro non si sente assolutamente il rumore dei locali. <br/>Le operazioni di check in e check out sono state molto facili grazie alla presenza del portiere, Yanis, il quale è anche a disposizione per informazioni turistiche o eventuali emergenze nell'appartamento. La jacuzzi sul tetto è sicuramente un benefit"

They coordinated a pickup for me at the airport and my driver was kind and knowledgeable. The apartments are nothing short of amazing. They are large, brand new and beautifully put together. The rooftop and jacuzzi provide an amazing nighttime view of The Acropolis. I really can't say enough good things about this place!<br/><br/>The apartment is close to the metro, nightlife and restaurants, it really is perfectly situated for anyone who wants to explore Athens on foot. I would absolutely stay here again and look forward to returning. Thanks Kostas and team for a memorable trip."

Peter gave us nice adresses to visit, restaurants and museums, and was very thoughtful.<br/>The appartement was beyond clean, well decorated and the bed was very comfortable.<br/>The hot tub takes some time to heat up, so you will have to be patient and prepare it in advance. Also, the gym was under renovation when we stayed there so we could not use it. <br/>Overall it is a really nice and enjoyable place to stay."

Alex who met us upon arrival was very kind and super helpful. Showed us the apartment and offered lots of great info on the area with maps. We stayed for 3 days. The second day he messaged me asking how we were enjoying things and if we needed anything. Definitely felt as though we could have reached out at any point and had a point of contact throughout our time there. Very responsive. <br/>The apartment itself had everything we needed. Kitchenette, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, nice living room and sitting area. The only thing, my daughter was looking forward to the hot tub on the roof and when we arrived found it was waiting for repair so could not use. Otherwise roof top was nice area to sit. <br/>The front bedroom is over a busy street so at night can be little noisy but it was not a problem for us because we were so tired after touring around each day. Easy arrival, easy departure, enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"

We did not have the pleasure of meeting Kostas but his communication through Air B n B was quick and easy, and a gentleman named Alex greeted us and helped us get into the apartment as well as advice on places to go throughout the city and how to get there. The apartment was very clean, and nothing super special about the decorations but it was well done, very modern, and very homey. 5 adults hit into the apartment comfortably, and the AC was a huge help in the Athens heat. I would strongly recommend booking and will let all my friends know to stay here if they were to visit Athens. "
14414976,296516829,2018-07-26,150766143,Belinda,Beware....the apartment provided was not the apartment advertised. Kostas insisted this was an optional upgrade however on arrival there was no option and we were provided with 1 bedroom rather than 2 and we had to use the lounge area as a bedroom for 2 which left us with no lounge area. Also it was ground floor not rooftop with jacuzzi. Kostas promised a partial refund which has not yet been received. This negative experience has left us feeling that hotels are a more reliable option than Air b&b. Sadly very disappointed. 
14414976,305452002,2018-08-11,54515381,Ibrahim,"Location was next to the Gazi square which was nice. The host is pretty aggressive and can come off as being rude. He told me that I’m not his employee, when we were having a conversation. That made me feel really uncomfortable and because I already paid and there is no refund policy, I just stated there. They put us in a room when we first checked in and moved us the next day because they said our wasn’t ready. That’s unprofessional. They get upset if you ask for more towels. The manager Peter was nice and gave us solid information on where to go and how to get around. That was very helpful. It has a nice rooftop view and overall it was a good value."
14414976,317326893,2018-09-02,7520757,Aviad,The place was very clean. And the host was very nice. Helped me with everything I wanted ;-) it’s was very good vacation
14414976,350372128,2018-11-19,34227697,Nick,"I came to Greece to visit family previously I checked into another apartment down the street which was awful it was very loud and I hated it after being there for 2 days I found Kostas place I sent him a message and right away he replied. my transition checking into Kostas was amazing, when I first got there I was greeted by Alex for works and he was very friendly, help me with my bags right up to my room. He explained to me where everything was in the area he gave me a map showed me all the places I need to visit some good restaurants and coffee which was very important haha. the building is in a very safe, and  nice neighborhood right across the street from Gazii also the train station it's very convenient. if you want to get a cab they are right outside the building, if you want to jump on the train and go to monastiraki it's literally 10 minutes away by train if you don't want to go far Gazi has amazing restaurants, clubs, and just some really cool martini bars. As for the apartments they are amazing, the views were unbelievable, the apartments are very clean, modern, very neat and organized, and very stylish. there is a roof deck with a hot tub being out there in the hot tub with the view of the Parthenon was marvelous. anytime I had a question, I needed something, Alex was right there to answer my question, it was very nice to have someone who was knowledgeable, who was there too answer any questions and help and was nice to look at haha. I highly recommend staying that Kostas apartments, I will be coming back in a few months and I will be spreading the word in the US to anyone who is coming to Athens that they should stay at Kostas apartments. Thank you Kostas and Alex for making my trip amazing."
14414976,351833184,2018-11-24,24839910,Karen,Nice modern space in a good location. The view from the building’s balcony is great. Responsive host.

14414976,505468890,2019-08-09,61527557,Phillip,This place is really a steal! The rooftop is what really sells this place. The view in the jacuzzi with the acropolis during sunset is just breathtaking and worth every penny. Trust me...your entire purchase is for that exact moment during sunset and the acropolis lights go on and you have a glass of wine in your jacuzzi with your loved ones. There is a local market that is a 5 min walk down the street. Plenty of restaurants in the gazi district that is also a 5 minute walk. Metro is right there too. This suite is on the second floor and the elevator is slow and small so just be ready to carry your luggage up if you’re a little impatient like I was. There is staff that helps out with your luggage and a front receptionist that will tend to all your questions and needs. Book this place. It’s a steal. No joke.

14414976,515481110,2019-08-23,256691767,Gijs,"I really recommend staying at Kostas' place. It's located very close to several bars, restaurants, shops and the subway. The apartment is clean and has two quite modern bathrooms, but the best thing is the rooftop: looking at the Akropolis out of your private (shared with 4 other apartments) jacuzzi is simply amazing - at night the Akropolis is even lit up.<br/><br/>The staff in the lobby is very friendly and helped us buying tickets to a local football game. If they're not at the desk, the team on the AirBNB chat is very responsive; even at night!"

The apartment was super clean and had AC which was a relief from the heat outside. Sadly the hot tub wasn’t available due to COVID. It was a wonderful stay and I would stay here again

A 5 stars check in experience with map, details about the city and even a list with key Greek works. The only downside is I felt I was in apart hotel with a reception during all day, not in a private Airbnb which I particularly don’t like - but the receptionist was so nice and friendly! The hot tub is not private and due to COVID 19 restrictions was not open."

14461789,229569182,2018-01-24,46240233,Javier,Evelyn is an amazing host. She would go an extra mile to make her guests feel great. As an example she contacted a nearby bakery to have them disconnect a faulty ventilation vent which was causing an unpleasant noise. I thought it was incredible that she could do that! Highly recommended.

Enjoy your view of the Acropolis while in the pool or root top table. If you have the opportunity to rent this place, you absolutely should! Thank you again Evelyn.  Tip for those reading: Juan Rodriguez resturant & bar is close and also A+ if you’re into punk, Bad Tooth bar is where to go."

The location is awesome & transforms at night into a fun hot spot of unique bars & restaurants with great walkability to everything one would want to see of Athens.  The aroma from the bakery downstairs was mouthwatering while soaking in the private pool. Highly recommend. Thank you Mikaela for everything you did to make our 2 night stay awesome!!! If coming from US, bring adapters for electric plugs. "

Pictures don’t do it justice as this place is out of this world. The location is great with many bars & restaurants located downstairs. There’s a full surround audio system that can connect to your phone via Bluetooth or USB. The bed is comfy & the shower is amazing. One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever stayed in."

Not only did I have a to die for view, comfy bed, fantastic amenities and even my own private rooftop overlooking the city and the Acropolis, but it was located in the BEST neighborhood. The communication was fantastic with Evelyn, Sofia and Mikaila - Sofia lent me her adaptor and gave me great suggestions for food and arranged my transportation upon arrival. And Mikaila waited with my luggage and was so kind and helpful upon departure. From start to finish it was a great stay. Thank you so much!"

We also canceled our plans for the night so that we could experience the place: the view, the amenities, the space. Plus, Mikaela who helped us was incredible. She was very responsive and so helpful. We'd definitely wish we could come back just for this place."

Sizable terrace with 360 views, amazing little pool overlooking the Acropolis, stylish design, all-you-need kitchen, comfortable bed, terrific location (easy walk almost anywhere you'd want to see in Athens, super cool neighborhood with bars and restaurants), and efficient communication with Emily and her team.

Very close to the major tourist sites. And most importantly, on a hot summer day, this flat is a destination on its own - with a real pool on the terrace with Parthenon view, true rarity which must be experienced."
14461789,526684784,2019-09-09,55325379,April,Amazing location. We stayed in Athens near the Acropolis and the museum at our Airbnb before this one and it was very touristy. We ended up walking 20 minutes to Plaka and Psyri every day because we enjoyed the area so much. Psyri is less touristy and you can find a lot of the locals hanging around here. With this apartment you are already in the middle of it all in less than 1 minute. There is so much good food around; you can even find cheap but delicious street food. There are a lot of options. The private rooftop terrace was a nice surprise and the apartment is very spacious.<br/><br/>Would suggest getting an Indian souvlaki from a place called Mirch down the street.
14461789,527082370,2019-09-10,215477877,Gabriel,Beautifully decorated villa in the heart of Athens. We loved the vintage feel of the place. Check in and stay overall was amazing.

14461789,533753032,2019-09-22,59281169,Nicole,"Evelyn was a great communicator and made check in and check out very easy. The place is exactly as pictured - spotless with excellent amenities. The view is outstanding - absolutely beautiful. Fully unobstructed and especially stunning when lit up at night. My only wish is that the plunge pool water hadn’t been so cold. Since it wasn’t very hot outside, I didn’t want to get in very very cold water. Something I should have thought of before! The outdoor space was still incredible - I just wasn’t able to use it as I had imagined. However, if you are coming in the middle of the summer it might be perfect for you! Overall, the place is stunning, the location is very central and feels safe and communication with the host was easy and reliable."
14461789,536573304,2019-09-27,10438480,Justin,"Fantastic apartment in a perfect location - spacious, awesome outdoor spaces, views are amazing.  Also appreciated that the hosts have made arrangements with a local cafe to have breakfast delivered - something you don't often get with an Air BnB.  Highly recommended."

14478684,101706324,2016-09-14,16799298,Luisa,"If I had to rate my satisfaction with Argyro´s apartment, out of 10, it would be 10. Argyro is an outstanding host. My husband and I arrived at Athens early than expected and not only was Argyro waiting to greeting us at the apartment but she stocked the fridge with plenty of goodies: fruit, jam, butter, wine, beer…to celebrate our arrival. We felt at home right away and found very easy to settle in. The apartment itself is beautiful, very good taste, comfortable, with lots of natural light and plenty of space for the two of us. The air conditioning worked very well as well as the stereo hi-fi. The apartment is very well located, in a quiet however vibrant neighbourhood with restaurants, taverns and shops in and around. It is also very well stocked with anything and everything you may need, from Nespresso coffee capsules, to Greek sweets to fine soap.  I can´t say enough good about this apartment. A fabulous place to stay and wonderful host. Thanks Argyro. "
14480359,95043524,2016-08-18,6137477,Marina,"Dimitrios is an excellent host. He met us and showed us around in the apartment, then took us around the neighborhood to show us the Greek and Japanese restaurants he personally prefers, the local supermarket, and the small shops around the block that make everyday life easy.
<br/>
<br/>Two bottles of Greek wine, a red and a well-chilled white, waiting for us on our arrival, both compliments of Dimitrios. This is a host who has thought not only of leaving a packet with tourist information in the apartment-  just in case one arrives after hours of the Tourist Information Office in Athens -  but also making available some English and French books for his guests to read.
<br/>
<br/>Location was the perfect choice for us. The apartment is so centrally located that one can walk to the famous Sytnagma Square, the Greek Parliament, the Acropolis, the Benaki, the Byzantine, the Cycladic Museums, while nightlife in Plaka is just around the corner. The place can be reached by bus or metro from the airport and one is really in the absolute “center” of the city center.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is beautifully decorated in a style that really stands out, and is fully equipped with everything we might need - combined with its fantastic location, makes it an excellent value for money. The hosts’ personal touch can be seen in all the minor details, from the choice of the kitchen electrical equipment to the three different types of coffee and variety of teas that are offered on a complimentary basis.
<br/>Highly recommend it, and we would be happy to be back at next opportunity. 
<br/>"
14480359,97125956,2016-08-26,91216552,Georgios,"This was a trip that left me with excellent experiences.
<br/>Arrival: Dimitrios was waiting for me with a bowl of fresh fruits and two bottles of complimentary wine, a red one and - in the fridge - a white one, for the welcome to the flat. He showed me around the apartment, with all its facilities and marked in a map of Athens, which he offered to me, all the places (museums, shops etc.) I told him I wanted to visit. Then we both went off for a walk to the close neighborhood, where he pointed out the restaurants that he recommends as he has already tried them. It is amazing to realise that in the center of the city centre there are small supermarkets and shops that sell anything from groceries to fruits and make the life of people who are into self catering easy, once somebody shows them to you. On the other hand the majority of the museums are in walking distance or easily reached by metro, bus or trolley bus.
<br/>Apartment: Apart from its absolutely central location the flat is decorated in a very appealing modern style and fully equipped with anything that one would like to have available in order to have a pleasant stay. The smart TV was a nice touch as well as all the smaller details that show the host has invested time in order to foresee the possible needs of his guests, there are books to read, tourist info, sewing kit, first aid kit, to name but a few. I was also very pleased to find a catalogue with the local wine bars that can be reached on foot, something I asked Dimitrios to provide me through a mail message.
<br/>Host: Dimitrios is recommended as a host that will try to make one feel at home as he is genuinely trying to answer all questions one can have and understand which are his guests’ interests in order to give information accordingly, that being the case with my catalogue of wine bars.
<br/>Conclusion: Taking into account the apartment’s location, the easy access by metro and buses from the airport, the fact that everything is within walking distance, its particular style and most of all Dimitrios’ behavior as a host, I regard it as excellent value for money and I will be coming back to it when I visit Athens again.
<br/>"
14480359,101212391,2016-09-12,33405580,S.,"Dimitris and his wife were perfect hosts. Upon arrival, they were waiting with a traditional welcome drink and gave us all information  about the flat, neighborhood and the city. Dimitris even offered to take us around in the area. The flat was extremely clean, comfortable  and a lot of small things have been thought about.  During our stay, Dimitris was attentive and prompt to respond to anything. We had a great time. We certainly look-forward to staying there again and highly recommend the place."
14480359,102756188,2016-09-19,20639966,Ma'In,"Wonderful! The apartment is in a perfect location, beautifully designed, clean, and has everything you'll need. Dimitrios welcomed us at 8 am in a very hospitable manner! He even got us a basket of fruits, apple pie, and bottles of wine. He made me feel home in Athens :) <br/>Thank you"
14480359,104861766,2016-09-29,16139296,Maciej,"This was, by far, the best Airbnb experience ever! I have traveled to many reaches of the world, stayed in many apartments and hotels, and can honestly say I have never come across such wonderful hosts. 
<br/>
<br/>Dimitrios and Aleka greeted us with a welcome drink, bought us fruit, baked goods and water, and even supplied the apartment with 2 bottles of wine (red and white) and a bottle of ouzo. 
<br/>
<br/>Nothing in this beautifully decorated and newly renovated apartment was left to chance. The hosts thought of absolutely everything! From coffee, tea, sugar and many kitchen supplies to first aid kit and sewing kit, Dimitrios and Aleka ensured our stay would be as comfortable and complete as possible. 
<br/>
<br/>Dimitrios promptly responded to all my messages (taking into account the time difference, of course) and was happy to accommodate all of our requests. He is courteous and professional. 
<br/>
<br/>My friends and I actually celebrated my birthday while in Athens. Unbeknownst to me, one of my friends communicated with the hosts asking where would be a good place for us to go and celebrate my birthday. Dimitrios and Aleka responded by delivering a surprise birthday cake "
14480359,105851312,2016-10-03,95239322,Walkiria,"Dimitrios went out of his way to make us feel welcomed and at home since our first contact (as our flight on Monday was at 6am). Upon arrival (with more than 1h flight delay), he and his wife were kindly waiting for us with a nice Greek welcoming :) They showed us around the apartment and recommended good places to eat/see. The apartment is just incredible: fully renovated, extremely clean, exclusive decoration, high quality linen, with amazing kitchen appliances and washing machine! By far the best Air BnB my daughter ever stayed in (and she travels all around).  I recommend this place also because of the location: really at the heart of Athens, and you can do everything by foot! Very lively and safe neighborhood with lots of options to eat around. Really, do not hesitate to book this 2-bedroom great option in Athens!"
14480359,106281858,2016-10-05,267976,Rita,"We loved our stay at this flat! Dimitrios and his beautiful wife Aleka have made this place so warm and welcoming! The added touches of wine, pastry and fresh fruits they provided were so nice and much, much needed at the time! We stayed at the flat on way to Santorini and again on our way back before leaving Greece! Very convenient to restaurants, bars and shopping in Plaka. Felt safe at all times! Beds were comfortable, A/C cold and a beautiful place! Wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Athens! Many, many thanks!
<br/>"
14480359,107566936,2016-10-11,47553618,Angelique,"Dimitrios and his wife Aleka warmly welcomed us to the apartment and instantly made us feel at home. They accommodated are last minute change to our check in time which gave us the opportunity to explore the city without any hassles. This made a great difference to our day!
<br/>
<br/>Fresh fruit, great local wine and cakes were waiting for us - a great bonus! The apartment has been recently renovated and has such personality with the funky decor, we really loved the attention to detail they have made to this home. It is also environmentally friendly with recycling options available and automatic electricity shut off as you leave the apartment for the day.
<br/>
<br/>The apartment is excellently located with all the major attractions within walking distance. We received great recommendations for restaurants, shops and bakeries in the area, as well as brochures of different activities in Athens. All transport options are easily accessible to get around the greater city or to the airport.
<br/>
<br/>Great stay, wish it was for longer than just one night but we will be back for sure! Thank you Dimitrios and Aleka!"
14480359,111124810,2016-10-30,37827636,Dennis,"Dimitrios regularly emailed us prior to arrival with information maps phone numbers etc. to assist our transport from the airport to his fantastic apartment.  Dimitrios was away when we arrived in late October but he arranged for his daughter Maria to meet us on arrival, she was fantastic showed us the apartment and gave us information on anything we asked.   There was even some complimentary wine a white and a red, chocolates and fruit that was very much appreciated.  The location is great, central and close to everything; there are restaurants, wine bar and travel agents within metres and lots of shopping, museums and the Acropolis within a short walk.  There is no noise inside even though it’s in the centre of the city and exceptionally well appointed, very clean with some great decor.  Very comfortable beds with good quality linen, the Wifi worked well and they have everything you could think of, safe, basic stationery, sewing kit, first aid supplies, shoe polishing kit, books, tour brochures, maps etc. washing machine, iron, plenty of towels and toiletries.  The kitchen had everything tea, coffee etc. and everything to cook with but we didn't use as we were keen to sample some of the many nearby restaurants. There is air-conditioning and heating. Dimitrios met us before we checked out after our 4 nights stay to make certain everything was OK and have a chat.  It was certainly the best Airbnb our family of 3 have experienced and would surpass many hotels as it felt like a home.  Thanks Dimitrios and when we get back to Athens we will definitely be staying with you again and I highly recommend your apartment to anyone and would be happy for anyone to contact me if they require any advice please feel free to pass on my email if required. Dennis, Sherry and Zoe Australia.  "

14480359,122679953,2016-12-25,104405287,Arthur,"If you need somewhere to stay in Athens, we have no hesitation in recommending you stay at Dimitrios's place.  Dimitrios has thought of everything that you could possibly need, and more.  The place is conveniently located, it is extremely clean and the beds are so comfortable.  Personally, Dimitrios will do everything he can to ensure your stay is  perfect and is a great wealth of knowledge - has an answer for everything.  We stayed here at Christmas time.  We couldn't believe all of the personal touches - decorations, fruit, traditional Greek sweets and wine.  How thoughtful and it made us feel like we were back in our own home celebrating.  Thank you, Dimitrios!!"
14480359,123901368,2016-12-31,54811728,Michael,"Dimitris contacted us before arrival so as to confirm the time of our arrival and to make sure that everything was okay. We requested to receive the keys late afternoon and he was very willing to accommodate us.
<br/>We met Dimitirs and his wife Aleka at the flat the time we agreed. They were very kind and polite. They showed us around the flat so as to make sure that our stay in their flat was going to be comfortable and pleasant. On the dining table, courtesy of Dimitris and Aleka ,there was a big basket full of fruits and two bottles of Greek wine. Furthermore they offered us a hand made gift which was made by their daughter. Their gesture was much appreciated. They also advised us about the dining options which were available nearby and places of interest in Athens which we should not miss.
<br/>What really impressed us was that they genuinely wanted our holidays in Athens and our stay in their flat to be an enjoyable experience.
<br/>They emphasized to us that they were available any time if we needed any help or advise. This made us feel that we had someone in Athens who really cared about us.
<br/>The flat is very centrally located. There are so many dining, shopping and sightseeing options literally few meters away from the flat. If on the other hand you want to move away from the centre, public transport is so close, including the metro station at Syntagma square.
<br/>The flat had been recently nicely decorated making you feel comfortable. We were four persons, my wife and my two children 10 and 14 years old. The Wi-Fi was excellent and the kitchen was well equipped providing  all the necessary utensils.  
<br/>During our stay Dimitris called us to ensure that everything was okay. I asked him if he could find out for us a taxi service to the airport since we were leaving a couple of days later. In no time I received an SMS from Dimitris providing the information.
<br/>The morning of our departure by mistake we closed the main  building door leaving one of our suitcases in. I called Dimitris and in 15 minutes time both Dimitris and Aleka were there so as to open the front door for us. 
<br/>We really had an excellent stay at Dimitris lovely flat.
<br/>We know now well where to stay when we visit Athens again.
<br/>
<br/>Thank you very much Dimitris and Aleka for being so considerate and hospitable making our holidays a memorable experience.

14480359,134609890,2017-02-28,30356729,Francesco,"This has been the best stay in all my trips. It would be unuseful to describe all the nice things we have found in this apartment: it would take so long resulting annoying for you reader. So please, go in this apartment for your next trip in Athens and discover it by yourself! Just to summarize: the best possible position in the city centre, very quiet during all day, clean and tidy, full of accessories, comfortable, nice…<br/>Dimitri and Aleka are two wonderful hosts, they welcome you friendly and give you all information you need, and more also. They knew about my anniversary and gave me a pie (yummy!) and some bottle of wine.<br/>I definitely suggest you to stay in this apartment: it is perfect for a family of 4 because it has two bed rooms, and you cannot get better for the same price.<br/>"

I had very high expectation before booking this place because of all the great reviews. Here are the reasons:<br/> 1. Communication: Dimitrios answered all our questions (and there were a lot of them) promptly before and during our stay, even when it comes to booking another place when we come back to Athens for one night stay when his flat is not available. <br/>2. Location: this flat is in the best location you can find. I won't elaborate because you can read it in other reviews. <br/>3. The flat itself: It is very well-decorated and have everything you need. Dimitrios has put in a lot of thoughts to make this place perfect with everything you can imagine. Perfect for sleeping for 4 people. <br/>4. What tops all these is Dimitrios and his wife welcomed us when we arrived. They explained everything in detail, including restaurant recommendations, maps, etc. Dimitrios's wife even make us special Mastic drink from the island Dimitrios is from. There are some seasonal fruits and bottles of red and white wines waiting for us. We just felt so welcomed and Dimitrios and his wife just gave us the best Greek hospitality. <br/>5. My friend recommends a Greek yogurt place with a photo of the front of the store. I messaged Dimitrios and he found the place and even called them to find out when they close so we can go. <br/>Never write such a long review so you know how I love this place. Just book it. <br/>"

There are many restaurants and cafes nearby, including a vegan and gluten-free restaurant and health shop just next door. <br/>Dimitrios and Aleka are fabulous hosts, who went out of their way to make us feel welcome- including ordering a special cake for my parents' anniversary, which was unexpected and very thoughtful!

De flat is origineel en met oog voor detail ingericht, voorzien van alles wat je maar nodig zou kunnen hebben (van EHBO kit tot en met aansteker om een kaarsje aan te steken). Vanaf de flat is eigenlijk alles beloopbaar en als je verder wil pak je de metro of bus vanaf Syntagma plein (5min loopafstand). Dimitrios & Aleka zijn met recht superhosts. We kregen een warm persoonlijk ontvangst en beide waren zeer genereus, communicatief en behulpzaam. Petje af."

It was funky, clean and in the prefect location.<br/><br/>Close to Placa, they include maps, a refreshment drink upon arrival, and EVERYTHING you could want on a trip away.  They thought of everything.<br/><br/>Next time in Athens, I will definitely be staying here.  It was quiet too."
14480359,152916120,2017-05-19,32011231,S,"Dimitrios’s place is located close to Syntagma Metro Station. Dimitrios has really done a fabulous job in decorating his house. You have everything you need in the house from umbrellas (for a rainy day) to medicine cabinet (just in case you get sick). The apartment has adequate space for four guests. We stayed at the flat on way to Santorini and again on our way back before leaving Greece. My experience on both occasions was simply amazing as he allowed us to check in early. He greeted us first time with Greek drink and took time to explain the eating joints/attractions.  The location of this apartment is perfect. Very close to shopping, attractions and restaurants. We would stay again on our next visit to Athens. Thank you for hosting us!   "

The apartment is incredibly well decorated, clean, and is well updated. It is on a great street around the corner from sytagma square and a short walk from the acropolis, plaka, monastaraki, and the rest of the Athens sites that are popular. There are lots of food and bar options outside of the touristy areas that are a close walk from the apartment as well. "
14480359,156811783,2017-06-01,35952643,Simanti,"We stayed at the apartment for five days and it was a wonderful experience. The house was located perfectly right opposite Syntagma square where we could walk everyday. Further, it was very convenient for us to visit all the tourist spots like the acropolis, ancient agora, temple of zeus, Hadrian library, roman agora etc on foot. Further there were many good restaurants and supermarkets nearby, so we could explore different cuisines or cook at the apartment very easily. Dimitrios and Aleka were wonderful hosts and they were very thoughtful in stocking the apartment with everything we would need on arrival along with additional complementary eatables and wine"

14480359,160663535,2017-06-15,11106012,Joey,Dimitrios' place is perfect. He is extremely attentive and demonstrated hospitality that I've yet to find at another Airbnb or hotel. I can attest to all of the positive comments shared by other guests. This is a safe bet.
14480359,161487564,2017-06-18,47991482,Ariel,Dimitrios is everything you could want in a host and his flat is everything you could want in a home away from home.  He greeted us with the warmest welcome including a cake to celebrate my sisters graduation! His flat was in a perfect area for us to stroll through the plaka as we made our way to the most beautiful sites around the city. <br/><br/>Couldn't have asked for a better set up! 
14480359,163295589,2017-06-24,29416980,Srikar,"This was our first time visiting Athens and our first Airbnb stay, and both exceeded our expectations by far. <br/><br/>This apartment was in a lovely neighborhood, just blocks away from two of the nicest and most expensive hotels in Athens. It’s walking distance from pretty much any major attraction in Athens, and if you need to go further it’s only a few minutes walk to the Metro and a giant taxi stand. <br/> <br/>Our host, Dimitrios, was super helpful in working around travel delays to get us checked in, and when we arrived he had prepared a traditional Greek drink and a map with things to eat and see around the apartment. <br/><br/>As for the apartment itself, it was super clean (very much appreciated by  my mother) and very nicely and creatively decorated. I also appreciated the shower, which was pretty luxurious. <br/><br/>We would definitely recommend this apartment for anyone wanting to stay in Athens and would look at this again if it is available the next time we visit. "
14480359,164421254,2017-06-27,19132455,Casey,"We can't really say enough about this home - from the great communication as we booked it to the lovely way he greeted us when we arrived with a traditional Greek drink and a map and checklist of local things to see and do, we felt at ease as soon as we arrived.  The home was decorated by the hostess and was peppered by original modern art works with a bike theme that was both relaxing but very cool.  The home was impeccably clean and had all the amenities we needed as we were traveling internationally and had packed as minimally as possible.   The air conditioning worked wonderfully and you had to understand after a full day of Athens heat it is absolutely required!  "

The apartment is comfortable and well-appointed with everything one could need (even including some breakfast pastries that came in handy for our early-morning airport departure).  Dimitrio was in constant touch with us before arrival, so that he was able to greet us once we arrived.  He oriented us to the neighborhood -- which is in a fabulous location close to everything -- and showed us around the apartment.  We highly recommend this as a place to stay and hope we'll have an opportunity to come back."

We have two teenagers, and there was plenty of space for all four of us to sleep, and relax when escaping the heat of the afternoon. The back bedroom is a bit quieter for those people who might be woken up by street noise.<br/><br/>The location is perfect. We walked to many attractions that were nearby, and were a short walk away from the metro station when we wanted to go further. Exploring Plaka was a highlight that we enjoyed on more than one evening! Shops and restaurants are plentiful in this area.<br/><br/>Dimitrios and Aleka are amazing hosts. Warm, welcoming, helpful, communicative, etc. I've stayed in many Airbnb places and they are definitely some of the best hosts I've had. <br/><br/>I highly recommend their place!

Dimitrios was so welcoming and gave us some very important tips about where to go and what to see in Athens.  His apartment is centrally located and within walking distance to every major historical site.  Location is very quiet at night which was great.  The lift was an added bonus.  The place is perfect for groups of 2 to 4.  For all the Aussies out there, a short 10 minute stroll from the Athens Sports Bar for prime AFL viewing."

Great location, clean and stylishly decorated space and Dimitrios and Aleka have thought of everything when it comes to the comfort and convenience of their guests.  Check-in was smooth, communication was excellent and the hospitality of the hosts was beyond compare.  Aleka and Dimitrios were so incredibly warm and welcoming and provided us with helpful local information such as restaurants and local events that were occurring the weekend we were in town.  The space was comfortable and bright and worked perfectly for our family of 4 (kids ages 11 & 8).  Just a few minutes walk from Sytagma Metro and surrounded by restaurants and markets.  Easily walkable to historic sites - cannot recommend this apartment enough!  Will definitely book again our next time through Athens."

In der Wohnung stand alles was man brauchte zur Verfügung, wie z.B. sämtliche Haushaltsgeräte, Tee, Kaffee, Klopapier etc. so dass man sich erst einmal um nichts zu kümmern brauchte. Alles in der Wohnung ist sauber und ordentlich. Man wohnt sehr zentral und trotzdem ziemlich ruhig. Alle Sehenswürdigkeiten kann man im Grunde gut zu Fuß erreichen. Die Altstadt, viele Restaurants, Shops und Einkaufstraße befinden sich unmittelbarer Nähe. Besser kann man wohl kaum in Athen wohnen wenn man sich die Stadt ein paar Tage ansehen möchte.<br/>Dimitrios hat auf Nachrichten immer sofort und kompetent geantwortet und hätte sicher gern noch mehr geholfen oder weitere Tips gegeben, wenn das erforderlich gewesen wäre.<br/>Das Preis- Leistungsverhältnis ist sehr gut, zumal wenn man bedenkt, das wir selbst mit einer 4-köpfigen Familie (4 Erwachsene) sehr gut untergebracht werden.

Before leaving for Athens, Dimitrios was both easy to get a hold of to coordinate with and flexible when we had a slight change of plans. When we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by Dimitrios and his lovely wife who not only presented us with local treats but explained where we were, where to visit in the city, and that we could call them if we needed anything at all during our stay. The apartment is PERFECT. So well thought out, comfortable, clean, and stocked with everything you could need from washing clothes to cooking a meal. Even the thought put into the soundproof windows and doors for a good sleep in the city was so appreciated. The little balcony over the street was our favorite part, and we spent many mornings and evenings listening to the city life while sipping coffee and playing cards. The location was also stellar, and we walked to over 90% of all our activities and meals. You won't be able to find a more charming or convenient spot. If we come back to Athens, we will ABSOLUTELY stay here again. Thank you both for everything. We couldn't have been happier :)"

The location is great and the place is uniquely decorated and with new washer machine and all the kitchen amenities , we just feel like at home with our family of four.  He offered tips and just made us so comfortable and relaxed arrival.  Thx again opening your house to us again and we highly recommend anyone to choose this place if you ever stay in Athens.

Our group consisted of three adults and one teenager and the layout of the apartment, spacious bathroom and spacious kitchen left us with no complaints!  The check in process was very smooth and we appreciated the welcome treats, including vegan pastries for my family. And the location - perfect! The apartment is quiet, though the street is lined with many conveniences (grocery store, wine shop, bakery) and restaurants and it is in close proximity to the Acropolis and the Plaka which we visited a few times.  Throughout our stay nothing seemed more than 10-15 minutes walk away from the apartment. Thank you, Dimitrios for a wonderful stay, I hope to visit again!"

There's a great shopping and restaurant area close by, but the block the unit is on is somewhat quieter, which is perfect.  Dimitrios was incredibly prompt and helpful in all communications, and even helped us on the transition from another apartment, going out of his way to accommodate.  The apartment was clean, well-equipped, spacious and comfortable and the multiple air cons in bedroom and living room really made the space comfortable on humid days in Athens.  Cool touches in the design, little welcoming items, maps and tips rounded out the experience.  Highly recommended."

The Acropolis and most everything is within walking distance.<br/>I could say so much more about the location, the flat and the hosts - all of it excellent!<br/>I absolutely loved our time here and wouldn't even consider anything else on my next trip to Athens.

Tons of amenities in the place, such as travel guides, and kitchen ware (i.e. frother to make Greek fredo coffee). The place welcomed us with 2 bottles of wine and fruit.

14488156,110566160,2016-10-27,52927853,Hiddi,Sofia war eine tolle Gastgeberin! Durch Sie hatten wir den besten ersten und den besten letzten Tag unserer Griechenlandtour! Sie hat uns viele Tipps gegeben und auch die Check Out Zeit könnten wir einfach mit ihr abstimmen. Leider haben wir es nicht mehr geschafft ihr Angebot etwas mit ihr trinken zu gehen wahrzunehmen. Das muss man definitiv bei der nächsten Reise nachholen. Die Lage des Appartments war genial. In 10min konnten wir zur Akropolis laufen und die Metro Station war nur 2 Gehminuten entfernt. Sehr empfehlenswert! Thank you Sofia! :)
14488156,111144123,2016-10-30,32350650,Ben,Sofia's place is modern and comfortable. We only stayed for one day but we surely would have enjoyed it if we stayed longer.

14488156,114554356,2016-11-19,85884289,Rishvinder,"BEST. HOST. EVER. <br/><br/>Let me tell you how amazing Sofia is. Many days prior to leaving for Athens, Sofia informed us about an imminent strike that affected the public transport to her place. She then provided an alternative way to get to her place. <br/><br/>Once there, we were shown around the house by her sister because we arrived late and she couldn't make it. Regardless, everything was handled perfectly. <br/><br/>She even went the extra mile to print out our boarding passes for our subsequent flight. She even dropped them off for us while we were out. <br/><br/>The apartment was fully equipped with everything you'll need (tea/coffee, kettle, Wifi, towels and multiple blankets, should you need them).<br/><br/>In short, we've been all over Europe and Sofia has, by far, been the best host we've ever had. I highly recommend this place. I guarantee you she will make your stay a pleasant and enjoyable one. <br/><br/>- Rish (from Singapore)<br/>"

And Sofia.. What a nice person! More than helpful, she was polite and kind, always having a good tip to give us and making sure we felt home. She has all the knowledge to reccomend good restaurants, coffees, bars and, of course, the special and historical must-see places in town. The apartament is the perfect deal for a couple, with everything (and more) that you will need. Plus: in the bed there are a lot of pillows (the girlfriend loved it!). The location is more than perfect, as you can go everywhere by foot and even thou you can have a good night sleep, as the big touristic movement is a couple of blocs away. Summing up: in the short and beautiful time we had in Athens, Sofia became one of the best things that happend to us in our trip :) Thanks Sofia, you are awesome!"

The appartment located in 3-5 minutes from the metro station ""Sagrou Fix"" on the street filled with the odor of bluming oranges. If you want to stay in a quiet place without screams of tourists and roaring of scooters and bikes near windows you should choose it. Price-quality ratio is perfect, comfortable for two persons, but mind that this flat has a small kitchen with not much space for cooking, so if you're going to stay long you should consider this."

We are not remotely religious but had the best time - an experience we would have never had without our wonderful hosts.  <br/>We can't recommend them enough and look forward to our next visit."
14488156,146457690,2017-04-23,34141475,Christian,Their place is a stone's throw from the subway or you can choose to walk around Athens like my wife and I did. The acropolis is about 1200m away from their place and you can walk to the Olympian as well. You will need to walk in order to make room for all the Greek food that is between their place and the sites.

14488156,179986160,2017-08-09,11435853,Joey,"Amazing apartment with A/C and everything needed for a really really comfortable stay!! It's a short walk to the metro, and only 2 stops to syntagma (where the buses to the airport are). The neighbourhood also feels very safe even at night. Sofia and Anna were always available to help and very welcoming! One notable thing is that we left something at the apartment and only realised it at night - thankfully we were still in Athens and they returned it to us! Their mom who came to greet us is also a sweetheart :)"
14488156,180646427,2017-08-11,61903688,Jonathan,Had a great stay at Sofia & Anna's. They even let us arrive early as we had an early flight which was very nice of them. Great location.
14488156,184036820,2017-08-19,76648532,Taryn,"Excellent experience! Flat was very clean and well located, walking distance to everything. Our host was wonderful and accommodated our very short stay and even had a cab ready for us when we left. Thanks again!"
14488156,186358045,2017-08-24,9608552,Publio,"The apartment is very clean and very cozy. I really enjoyed it and would stay there again. The decor is tasteful, the equipment is modern, the linens of good quality ... Perfect clean! There is local shopping nearby and the Acropolis is a few minutes walk away. There are also tourist restaurants nearby. Thank you very much for the reception, sorry for something that I did not leave as it should. I strongly recommend to a person or couple in view of a few days to the city; I would stay in the same space again. Thanks."
14488156,187430016,2017-08-27,22505763,Emily,This is a clean and cozy airbnb in a great location. It takes about 10 minutes to walk to Acropolis and is close to nice restaurants. Communication and check-in/check out were very easy. Definitely recommend staying here! Thank you!
14488156,188399023,2017-08-29,14802245,Guillaume,"Une adresse que je recommande. Sofia et Anna nous ont attendu jusqu'à 1h du matin, avec le sourire. Tout était impeccable."
14488156,189545082,2017-09-02,70465272,Linda,I Spent great time in the flat. Great position to visit the city. The rooms are clean and the apartment is silent. Perfect also the communication with the hosts.
14488156,190808904,2017-09-05,3541725,Bradley,"If you’re reading reviews across a dozen tabs and trying to decide between a few places, please save some time and book Sofia and Anna’s flat right away.<br/><br/>Arriving at 4:30am after a series of delays, Anna and Sofia were waiting with a smile as if it were the middle of the afternoon. I hopped into a large and comfy bed and woke up a few hours later to a hot shower, very clean, where the water comes from above and you don’t have to hold the showerhead in your hand (unless you’d like!). Air conditioning and wifi work perfectly, too!<br/><br/>You might know already, but the neighborhood is great. Local food and culture but so close to the metro, tram, and bus—and a brief but delightful walk to the Acropolis. The entire city is easily accessible, but you’d be satisfied to stroll the streets of Koukaki for days, watching a slice of authentic Athenian life.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Sofia and Anna are extraordinarily kind and helpful. They truly care about their guests and making their experience the best. You might find another apartment with a hot shower and cold A/C, but you’ll rarely find two people who will go out of their way to help at any moment—not because they’re obligated but because they’re genuine."
14488156,191922432,2017-09-09,25162543,Marguerita,"Our stay at Sofia and Anna's was just what we needed. Clean, comfortable and cosy apartment in a fantastic location, about a 15 minute walk to the Acropolis and all the sights. A lovely surprise was that this neighbourhood also has it's own little 'plateia' (square) full of bars, cafes and restaurants. If you explore the area there are little lovely cafes that pop up around every corner. Really liked it and would stay again if we go back to Athens. Thank you."
14488156,193298404,2017-09-13,39943303,Paul And Nga,"Nice location and listing... About a 10-15 minute walk from the Acropolis, with easy access from the metro.  Many dining options within walking distance as well.  Highly recommend!"
14488156,193821896,2017-09-15,101296758,Erikson,"Sofia and Anna’s place was perfect! It is super close to the metro station, which makes getting around and exploring very easy. The apartment is very cozy and feels like home. Sofia and Anna are always accessible too and we’re very helpful and welcoming! The neighbors are also very friendly in the area. I would highly recommend staying at their place!"
14488156,195064059,2017-09-18,117612365,Elodie,"Sophia et Anna nous ont parfaitement indiqué comment trouver notre chemin. L'appartement  est charmant, très propre et très bien situé.  Restaurants, bars sympas à proximité et à peine 10 min de marche pour aller à l'Acropole. <br/>Nous regrettons juste d'avoir appris le matin de notre départ que nous devions quitter l'appartement à 10H00..."
14488156,195401828,2017-09-19,33787377,Hannah,"Anna's place is exactly as described. Since it was my first time in Athens I didn't know what to expect. Some of the homes around Anna's place were kind of not well kept and sketchy but as soon as I entered her place it was a different story. My only complaint is the shower but it isn't Anna's fault. She tried explaining it to my and I thought I was following her instructions but it was pretty cold water. I'm sure it was because I'm American and couldn't figure it out, not because something was wrong with the water heater. Thanks Anna for letting me stay there! PS it is an easy walk to acropolis!"
14488156,195688905,2017-09-20,65775201,Claire,"L'appartement de Sofia et Anna est très bien situé, proche du métro, quartier sympa.  L'appartement est décoré avec goût  Accueil très chaleureux, merci beaucoup ! "

Plenty of restaurants near bye, Ambrosia just outside the tube exit was reasonable with generous portions the mixed grill for two well worth the price.  Cant fault the flat or the host well recommend them. Much thanks again to our hosts for the extra help.."

The apartment and balcony were charming. The bathroom as the rest of the apartment was very clean and the bed comfy. <br/>We found nice local places for drinking and food in Koukaki.  Sofia helped us to find a good store for some greece Rakomelo to take it home, so we really have nothing to complain about...We can definitely recommend it. Enjoy your stay there... and a big Efharisto from Laura and Philipp"
14488156,203076514,2017-10-14,88284863,Niels,"We both loved Sofia's apartment. We stayed there for 4 days and it was great. Especially Sofia's lovely character, the location of the apartment (it's perfect to go everywhere in Athens) and the plenty of tips we got from Sofia. Also, we arrived at night and she did not make a problem of this AT ALL. Even more so, Sofia arranged for a friend to come pick us up at the airport in the middle of the night and did everything to give us a great welcome to Athens. We couldn't have had a better stay; it was simply perfect. The apartment is located literally 5 minutes from Acropolis and still it is very quiet at night making it actually possible to have a good night's rest while staying very central in Athens.<br/>Oh, one more thing, the shower is absolutely amazing! It was even better then at home!<br/>Thank you Sofia! And please tell your friend that she is a wonderful person and thank her once again for coming to get us upon arrival :) See you soon in Malta! Cheers, Jill and Niels"

14488156,209821878,2017-11-06,29330677,Uju,Sofia and Anna's apartment is exactly as described. Perfect location for exploring the interesting sites of Athens.The apartment itself is quite lovely in a quiet area so even though you are literally 15mins walk from most of the tourist sites you are still spared the noise. There are lovely restaurants and shopping centre close to the house too. Perfect place to explore the best that Athens has to offer.
14488156,210814459,2017-11-11,156646483,Elise,"Appartement très bien placé à distance raisonnable de tous les principaux  monuments (10min de l'Acropole ). Supermarché en plus à 2 min de l'appartement. Sofia et Anna sont vraiment disponibles pour donner des informations utiles (carte, restaurant ,café...). L'appartement est petit mais bien agencé avec tout ce qu'il faut (chauffage , serviettes...) néanmoins l'appartement est mal isolé du bruit extérieur, surtout de l'entrée du bâtiment  (l'appartement est situé au rdc). Cela ne nous a pas empêché d'avoir un séjour très agréable."
14488156,211035311,2017-11-12,15835926,Wendy,Great hosts and a cozy place to stay in Central Athens. Sofia went the extra mile to fetch us from the metro station after knowing we were unsure how to get to her place. She also offered to help us haul a cab after knowing we had to check out during midnight. Great hospitality and we would recommend her to other Airbnb users.
14488156,214241155,2017-11-25,60626722,Rena,"Convenient location, comfortable flat, and everything is 5-15 minutes by foot. Sofia and Anna are such great hosts and provided me with great tips on eating and even helped arrange a taxi for 3:30AM pickup. They also provided easy to follow directions to the flat from the Metro station which was very helpful. Would definitely recommend if you want a comfortable home away from home."

Her mother was really welcoming, even though we didn't speak any Greek. The apartment is cute and cozy, and is located in a really nice area (10-15 mins walking distance from Acropolis and small pedestrian streets). The flat is as described, really comfy with everything necessary for a pleasant stay :) Good value for money. Totally recommend ;)"

That's the tourist area :)  As for stocking up stuffs, there is one supermarket just around the corner where Anna's place is. My advice is to get everything there as it's way cheaper than purchasing items from convenient store as they can get expensive."
14488156,261358674,2018-05-06,92001851,Kevin,Sofia was an outstanding host. Location was great near metro. Walking to all the sites couldn’t be easier and food everywhere. I would recommend her place every time for Athens. Thanks again Sofia.

The bathroom is really beautiful too!<br/>Unfortunately we have hardly slept since a dog barked from 21:00 to 2:00 in the morning ... this is not their fault but we found the night difficult. <br/>I guess it's the price to pay for an apartment downtown!<br/>Enjoy your stay.

Excelente hospitalidad y buenas recomendaciones sobre restaurantes y sitios de interés. El apartamento es pequeño, pero está muy bien equipado para una corta estancia. Muy limpio y agradable.

Wir wurden von ihm an der Metro-Station in Empfang genommen und zur Unterkunft gefahren. Dort erwartet uns sogar schon ein gefüllter Kühlschrank für den nächsten Morgen. Alles ist sehr sauber und stylisch. Ein Ort zum wohl fühlen! Und Christos war rund um die Uhr für uns da, hat alles erklärt und ist einfach ein Mensch mit einer so positiven Ausstrahlung! Auch wer kein griechisch kann, ist bei Christos nicht verloren. Er erklärt alles in Englisch bis man es verstanden hat. Stadtplan und Informationen incl. Danke Christos!"

It was very clean with a lovely fully functional kitchen and a nice bathroom with a great bathtub that easily fits two. The bed was very comfortable and he provides both air conditioning and heaters. Christos picked us up from the train station in his car and drove us around the neighborhood to show us the nearest grocery store and restaurant. He provided us with lots of helpful advice and even gave us free tourist maps. I highly recommend this location. It was very quiet but still very central to everything. His rooftop terrace was the perfect place to eat breakfast with a wonderful view of the whole city. <br/>To conclude. It is clean, quiet, has everything you need during your stay, it is very central and Christos is very friendly and willing to give you any advice that you might need. He also had some food already in the kitchen awaiting our arrival, fruit, cheese, bread and coffee. "

Great location near Thissio and close to plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, and the metro. The apartment was very well designed, the kitchen was fully stocked, there is a washing machine, fast and reliable wifi, and most importantly a very comfortable bed. Christos picked me up from the metro and showed me around the neighborhood. He was attentive, easy to communicate with, and very friendly. I can't think of anything negative - definitely a gem."

The location is great, it's very close to Acropolis, you can go every view by walking within twenty minutes. The apartment is very clear and comfort. There is all equipment for cooking. The time we stay was very hot, the air conditioner worked very well. Christos also prepared bread and fruits for us. We arrived in Athens in the middle of night, Christos still there waiting for us. As Christos lived in up floor, you can reach him whenever you need him. He also give us good help on transport information. We definitely will be Christos place when we back to Athens next time.

His decor is out of a magazine cool and his whole house so inviting and extremely welcoming. <br/>The tub is the best part, taking a shower will seem so outdated and boring.

We appreciated Christos help in finding nice cafes, bars and walking directions. If we are to return to Athens we will definitely be back.<br/><br/>The space itself is an artist dream with interesting books in English and Greek as well as access to paper, charcoal and pencils which we had so much fun creating. <br/><br/>Thank you Christos for the detail and effort it was so appreciated.

Not only was he the best host ever by being super responsive and providing us with not just the relevant but also extra information, but also his apartment - located so beautifully and central - provided us with everything we needed and more for our stay... especially by making it feel like we are coming home every day. <br/><br/>My best friend and I stayed for 7 nights and had another friend visit only for 3 nights which was no problem at all. The apartment was perfect for a girls trip but I would always return with a partner or family member as well and overall highly recommend staying at Christos‘ apartment if you want to explore Athens.

Die Küche ist schön und praktisch. Es gibt eine Dachterrasse auf der es sich gut leben lässt. Christos hat uns unzählige Tipps gegeben was die Umgebung und Sehenswürdigkeiten angeht. Die Lage der Wohnung ist top. Akropolis und Co sind zu Fuß oder per Fahrrad easy zu erreichen. Ich werde aufjedenfall bei meinem nächsten Aufenthalt wieder hier her zurück kommen.

Christos also has some vintage antiques that just cozy up the space. The apartment was extremely clean and well kept with space to cook, dine and do much more."

14494899,523210363,2019-09-03,44202130,Jessica,"Christos was a fantastic host. He was communicative and flexible when our ferry to Athens was delayed and ended up checking in later than expected. His place was clean and incredibly spacious. It was in the perfect location, close to all of the major sites and great restaurants. I would recommend staying at Christos's place if you're visiting Athens."
14494899,525140924,2019-09-07,166427150,Jana,The apartment of Christos is not only the best Airbnb we experienced but the most cool flat we ever saw. Fully equipped in a clever way. You can find there everything you may need for your common life but more interesting are the things you normally don’t expect. Christos is a very reliable person with a human approach. Jana and Evgeny
14494899,528449036,2019-09-13,398363,Steve,"I'd looked at many Airbnb's before deciding on this one, and I'm really glad I went with the reviews! The pictures, while of course beautiful, are not even as good as the real thing. It felt much larger than it looked in the pictures due to the high ceilings and you also have the rooftop all to yourself. <br/>The area is really nice, close to two metros, although we just walked everywhere. It's quieter than a lot of the centre places, and really enjoyed being there for a few days. The bed was super comfy too, one of the best on our trip so far."
14494899,530658088,2019-09-16,32640821,Gokul,"honestly, an all-round wonderful experience.  beautiful place, pictures dont do it justice. one of the best airbnb places i have stayed at. nothing negative to add."

14494899,536640176,2019-09-27,5731347,Stefan,"Christos' apartment was divine: spatious, tastefull, a fantastic and well equipped kitchen, huge rooftop! The location was great too, calm but very close to the centre. Nearest supermarket and bakery within a few minutes walking. If you want to eat out there's no need to leave the neighborhood since there are quite some good restaurants around. We will definitely stay at his apartment again."
14494899,539353405,2019-10-01,256980533,Jan,"We absolutely recommend Christos’ apartment. Not only the quick and reliable communication upfront our arrival was helpful, also the tips for sightseeing, restaurants and a quick overview about the district during his warm welcome made our stay so comfortable. He prepared map with the relevant spots around, gave an overview about them in person and prepared a PDF with 60 pages of recommendations for a stay in Athens on the iMac in the apartment  A true superhost! <br/>The apartment is comfortably arranged, absolutely clean and you will find everything you need to enjoy a pleasant stay. It’s located close to the central (but quite as it’s in a quite sidestreet), especially Acropolis as well as the beautiful districts of the “old” Athens. Just a five minutes’ walk and you are in the middle of the beauty of the Athens and can continue to walk in the park around the Acropolis. The apartment can be reached directly from the airport via Metro and you will find all relevant shopping facilities for daily use in the direct neighborhood. A perfect place to stay in Athens!"
14494899,541513476,2019-10-05,25202980,Helen,Perfect location for exploring Athens! Great value and lovely quiet place to stay. Thank you Christos!
14494899,550722339,2019-10-19,69972036,Vrinda,"A big thank you to Christos for his incredible space. The apartment is close to the acropolis and agora, with many amenities both within and around the apartment. The only thing to be aware of is the noise from the street if you’re a light sleeper - but I think that would occur across the city due to its residential planning. All in all a really great experience."
14494899,553929301,2019-10-25,26515595,Emily,"Excellent few days at Christos' apartment, location is great for all the central areas and Gazi. The nearby Filopoppolous hill offers fantastic sunset views and the cafe on the corner nearby is great, which Christos recommended. We especially enjoyed using the art equipment and exploring the local area. Great house and worth a visit"
14494899,557013964,2019-10-31,1559425,Jane,"Christos' apartment is spacious, clean, well-appointed and comfortable. It's in a great location to see the main tourist attractions of Athens, or to give you a place to rest and re-energize. We enjoyed the art materials, the organ, and the chess board and the beautiful stereo. Thanks Christos! Many thoughtful and generous touches."
14494899,563208436,2019-11-12,18167942,Susan,"Well, Christos’s place is by far the best AirBnB I’ve stayed in. The photographs don’t do it justice - it’s beautifully laid out, stylish, sparkling clean. It’s got everything - position, peace once you step inside, a rooftop view to die for, and lovely Christos as host. Perfect!"
14494899,568940426,2019-11-25,27953464,Margaret,This was my first time in Athens and I really enjoyed the location.  The street was very quiet and close to anything you might need.  Christos was very responsive and lives above the apartment.  I especially liked being able to walk to Filapappou Hill and see the city!  It is an easy walk to all of the main sights.  Highly recommend.
14494899,572611503,2019-12-03,31000321,Constance,"Christos' flat was gorgeous  comfortable and secure. We like to cook and the kitchen was perfect for making yummy food from local markets! The location is brilliant for walking to museums, shops, parks and other parts of Athens. He was there to meet us and answered questions immediately and gave excellent directions to local services. Truly one of the nicest lets we've stayed in. I would highly recommend."
14494899,583070365,2019-12-28,110923257,Karl,"Stylish ground floor apartment, which is bigger than it looks in the photos, in a great location of a quiet but central area. It was a cold December and the flat which has high ceilings took a while to heat up through the aircon. Curtains have to be kept down for privacy in daytime; at night time if you’re sensitive to light, some does come through from the street lamps. The host Christos is very helpful and easy to contact as he lives upstairs and kindly gave us access to the roof terrace where we enjoyed our breakfast in the sunshine."
14494899,703502842,2020-10-25,14476757,Sergio And Giles,"Just lovely. Highly recommended. A comfortable, stylish place in a lovely quiet corner of Athens very close to the centre but also to Filopappou park and to the metro. Christos was available and always responded immediately."
14494899,715484228,2020-12-14,14476757,Sergio And Giles,"This was the second time we stayed here and this time for several weeks. It is lovely, homely, stylish and comfortable and Christos was always available to assist with any issues that arose. Absolutely recommended."

14494899,399034066882399499,2021-07-04,22366348,Dorothea,I stayed at Christos’ apartment for 5 weeks. Its location is excellent and the apartment itself is a joy to live in. I will always want to return.
14494899,403333715663156991,2021-07-10,6163167,Liz,"The place was perfect for us visiting Athens. Close to 2 metro lines and walkable to some main sites, which was great. <br/>It’s near a lot of restaurants and bars, and just a 10 min or so walk to get to different neighborhoods.<br/>The bed was really comfortable and we certainly had everything we needed.  ☺️"
14494899,410610377742448765,2021-07-20,87193685,Issam,"You may not get to meet Christos as he is on an artistic mission but his beautifully designed apartment says a lot about him. If you enjoy cooking on your travels (there is an amazing full kitchen filled with herbs and equipment), if you enjoy music (there is a guitar and a piano among other instruments), if you enjoy art (drawing and paintinf tools and canvases), this is a place to relax. On the other hand, the location is perfect and central to all tourist sites. Above all, there is Christos and his hospitality which are indescribable and I can't recommend him enough as a host."

Christos' place is so tasteful, more than fully eqipped, located perfectly, spotless clean, modern, and it has so much space! You can't see in the pictures how big it is... Communication and check-in was absolutely flawless and so warm and friendly. I felt at home at all times and I slept like a baby. I'd always love to come back again!"

Very spacious, comfortable, stylish, and fully equipped. The « as huge as a flat » rooftop offers an amazing view, especially for enjoying sunrises and sunsets. <br/>The neighborhood is quiet and central. Only 20 minutes walk from the Acropolis. <br/>Christos and her friend who welcomed us were very friendly and arranging. <br/>Highly recommended."

14494899,454124397712792473,2021-09-18,84423223,Yvonne,"This is truly a wonderful address in Athens. The apartment is full of personal details that tell the story of an owner with a big cultural heart, who also provides so<br/>much more than you would<br/>normally expect. From cookingherbs, an extended recordcollection, musical instruments and drawingmaterials to every hygienic product you might need.<br/><br/>The music installation is excellent, we enjoyed it every morning and evening.  <br/><br/>We had so much in our itenerary that we did not have enough time to enjoy the rooftop terrace, but it is certainly a big bonus.<br/><br/>The location is perfect as well, close to two metrostations, but it is even more fun to explore the neighbourhoods by bike as we did. Than you discover the true gems that you will otherwise miss when travelling underground. And you will not only discover Plaza and Psiri but also Thissio, Kerameikos, Gazi and Metaxourgeio. And if you have time, cycle to the coast as well, there is an excellent bikeroad, which also leads you to Stavros Cultural Center with a beautiful view from its amazing rooftopdeck.<br/><br/>Athens is a city with many sides, not always pretty but always interesting, and the people are very friendly.<br/>Go discover this fascinating city with Christos’ apartment as your perfect homebase."

Christos was a fantastic host, very welcoming and had great recommendation for our visit. If you are planning to visit Athens, I highly recommend staying here.

It's at the foot of Lycabettus Hill which you should definitely walk to the peak of for sunset or sun rise.... The private rooftop & pool are very special and it's a wonderful oasis from the heat & hustle of the city. I would definitely stay there again. It and all the comforts of home.

Le batiment est très sécurisé et on se sent vite a l'aise dans cet habitation décoré avec beaucoup de gout. De plus, le roof-top permet de profiter du soleil grecque, voir même de se rafraichir les pieds dans l'eau avec une vue plongeante sur Athènes. De plus, Dimitris & Nadia sont des hotes très chaleureux (pleins de conseilles sur les endroits a visiter, les iles a parcourirs, les cafés ou se rendre...) Bref, nous rentrons des étoiles pleins les yeux. Merci Dimitrix & Nadia, hope to see you at Bordeaux!     "

The accommodation itself and its' location is superb.     Dimitris and Nadia made us feel so welcome, and provided us with lots of very useful information that helped us to make the most of our stay.  The apartment is very unique, full of very interesting art-work.  The roof-pool and terrace is magnificent.   We had a wonderful stay and I do not hesitate in recommending this high end apartment.

He is true gentleman and very interesting to talk to and ensured that everything was taken care of and he also makes a wonderful Greek coffee! The apartment itself is in a superb area of Athens - quiet - yet very close to the centre - all within walking distance or a very quick cab ride. Lots of good restaurants and bars close by with a good supermarket and bakery with great fresh produce. There are fantastic running trails in the woods immediately behind the apartment which take you up to the top of Lycabettus Hill where the views are staggering! The swimming pool area with its views over Athens are amazing both during the day and at night with total seclusion and the downstairs balcony is ideal for eating out at night. The rest of the space is delightful and open with light flooding in everywhere - with great original artwork on the walls and great furnishings and very comfortable beds and lovely bedrooms. There is a fully equipped kitchen, satellite TV and wifi throughout which means that it is ideal for a business trip as well as a holiday. A truly wonderful place and so much better than a hotel!"

14500505,110281990,2016-10-25,30386282,Aakash,"Dimitris' hosting started before I even booked the airbnb. He was very helpful by giving me a great explanation of the city before I arrived as well as when we landed.  His home was picturesque sitting at the bottom of Lycabettus Hill. In the morning, my brother and I went for a hike to see the sunrise on Lycabettus Hill although it is supposed to be a much better sunset. Overall, Dimitris' place is great and fit a family of 6 easily. The view of Athens from his rooftop is phenomenal and I recommend anyone coming to the city to stay there if you want to get away from the noise. "

<br/>In a nutshell:  SPLENDID APT WITH A ROOFTOP POOL - 270 DEGREES VIEW OVER ATHERS - IN A PERFECT, SECURE, UNIQUE LOCATION - 100% RECOMMENDED TO FAMILIES, COUPLES, GROUP OF FRIENDS!
<br/>
<br/>Our HOST Dimitris:
<br/>The communication & service pre-arrival as well as during our stay couldn't have been any better! Dimitris was always proactive from the beginning to the end, sending us interesting pre-read and video links about the cultural To-Do's in and around Athens as well as perfect recommendations for Restaurants, Bars, etc.
<br/>
<br/>He also organized for us Airport limousine transfers, which all were on time by professional English-speaking drivers. Our arrival got delayed by 6 hours and during that time he was moving his schedule to accommodate our situation.
<br/>
<br/>Upon our arrival he showed us his huge and stunning apartment which is equipped with all the bells and whistles one could ask for and welcomed us with a Greek coffee and wine and assured that we had a full Greek breakfast the next morning as we were arriving late.
<br/>
<br/>The APARTMENT:
<br/>The Apartment is a Douplex Penthouse with a stunning rooftop terrace (150sqm) and a large clean pool with a stunning 270 degrees view over Athens. It is right at the foot of Athens's highest Lycabettus Hill (very nice walk up there or by cable car - to have a fantastic view over Athens & the Akropolis) in a very secure and quite area (the US embassy & residence is only a block away). The living area is very tastefully decorated with 2 bathrooms / 3 bedrooms and a large patio/balcony on the lower level as well surrounding this floor on 2 sides. The pictures you see do not capture the breathtaking view from the rooftop terrace - in reality is looks even more spacious. Also perfect to work from there with WIFI access on both floors.
<br/>
<br/>The LOCATION:
<br/>Perfectly located only 3-5min walk to a nice square with nice bars and restaurants and only 7-10min walk to KOLONAKI where most of the luxury boutiques and nice cafe and restaurants are located not crowded by tourists at all. only 5-8min walk from there you are at Syntagma Square in front of the Hotel Grande Bretagne.
<br/>Taxi/UBER ride to Kolonaki from the Apt is only about EUR 3,50 and to Akropolis area about EUR 7-8,-
<br/>
<br/>Thank you very much Dimitris for the great stay we had with you - it was our first visit to Athens - but for sure not the last (hopefully at the same place)!

His place was very spacious with amazing views from the rooftop (pool looked great but it was too cold to partake). He and Nadia provided great recommendations during our stay and helped arrange transportation to/from airport. I would definitely recommend staying at his place. We'll be back this summer to enjoy the rooftop pool.

14500505,142406825,2017-04-08,24253149,Anne,"The host is regretfully over invasive and'does not accept the right distances, he did scare my friends with violent and abusive behavior. the flat is really for 2 as there is only one good bedroom and bathroom, the neighborhood is disappointingly a few blocks away from the right one and a bit gloomy"
14500505,144483145,2017-04-16,1265424,Chen,Dimitris was great. Very helpful. <br/>Came up with great suggestions and advice. <br/>Great host. 
14500505,148632637,2017-05-01,54111411,Svend,"My friends and I had the best time in mr. Santixis stunning and very spacious apartment. And mr. Santixis was the perfect host.<br/>The place is very beautiful and extremely private. The luxurious terrace upstairs with its very well kept and clean pool almost made it hard for us to be Athens tourists , because lounging up there was so peaceful and quiet. The perfect luxury apartment for a long weekend getaway , if one needs to relax. All the amenities that one can wish for are in this wonderful house. We left rested and revitalized. On the plane back to Copenhagen I immediately started planning when to go again."
14500505,155272600,2017-05-28,6953172,Michel,Appartement magnifique <br/>La terrasse avec sa piscine est superbe et très agréable avant et après les visites dans Athènes 
14500505,156377079,2017-05-30,7156124,Leslie,"I love staying in an apartment on the first leg after a transatlantic flight just so we can wash everything we traveled in but this apartment went far beyond just being a nice place to do laundry. There was lots of room for the four of us to spread out and relax after a long day of sight seeing. The location is a short uber/taxi ride away from the main tourist areas of town and the fares were super cheap- average of 3.50 euro each way. Dimitris was extremely responsive both before and during our trip, despite the fact that he was himself traveling at the we arrived. Nadia welcomed us to the apartment. We arrived on a Sunday and the local markets were closed so she took it upon herself to drive to a grocery store and pick up a few provisions to get us through the first night. I consider that going way above and beyond! We visited Athens at the end of May so the weather was still a bit chilly. We hope to return someday to use the rooftop pool. What a great space to hang out! Overall we couldn't have been more pleased with our accomodations and the hospitality of our hosts. "
14500505,157005311,2017-06-02,75603834,Erik,"The host was vey kind... They did however show up on the second day and hang out for an undetermined amount of time. They called at 1500 and asked if they could stop in to print something. We went out and returned around 2000 to find the host still there? This was very odd and intrusive in my opinion, they also left without taking any papers?? Other than that the view is great, location is nice. I wouldn't recommend this home for people with small (under 5) children, too much stuff that can break and a spiral stair case with marbal steps and no railing."
14500505,157926614,2017-06-05,121630324,Erazmus,"The Host: Dimitris was a professional host during our 4 days in Athens. He was always available via phone and viber when we had a question. He provided a very detailed description about the residence and Athen as well. He also helped us out with organizing airport transfer (Black A6) and in general he is 10/10. The residence: it is well equipped, perfect location, clean and cozy. We couldn't miss anything from the house. Really, like many extra bath lining, nespresso, kitchen with orange, olive oil etc.. basically we could eat upon arriving :).<br/>The roof garden is amazing, the pool is extremely clean and the water was on perfect temperature. In the nutshell we needed to decide if the Hilton or this residence.... and we did it right choosing this residence."
14500505,159915738,2017-06-12,69678208,Julia,"The host was professional, generous and gracious - meeting us only when we arrived and prepared to depart, but accessible by email at other times.  The apartment is very lovely and the patio on the main floor faces the park, bringing a peaceful landscape of birds, breezes and trees into every moment you are there.  Although very convenient in terms of location - it feels very private and far from the bustle of the city as a result.  Its a quite magical spot in a wonderful and dynamic city."
14500505,161933238,2017-06-19,95401139,Jonathan,"This was a classy apartment in a classy area and exactly as described on the web site. Dimitris was in touch beforehand with some suggestions, arranged transportation to and from the airport and met us on arrival. He very kindly left a well-stocked fridge and a bottle of wine to start us off. There is a parking space but we took Uber taxis (to avoid the standard taxis who tried to overcharge us) around Athens and rented a car from downtown Athens for a few days to do a trip to Delphi. The view from the pool over Athens is fabulous and whilst on the one hand you can't see the Acropolis on the other hand it overlooks the Panathinaikos F.C. Stadium. It took us a while to work out the best way to sleep was with the air-con running and ear plugs and although we didn't see many mosquitoes we did get bitten quite a bit. We would definitely stay there again on any repeat trip."
14500505,164021567,2017-06-26,101795806,Ari,"Accueil, beauté de l'appartement avec piscine et vue sur Athènes et sur un parc, Dimitris maître des lieux est simplement parfait."
14500505,165137567,2017-06-30,72042434,Renata,"The superb apt is located very near the center of Athens but discreetly withdrawn from the city crowd . Cab services works perfectly and are cheap.<br/>The place is really spacious , the rooms and kitchen were very clean and neat, also with free internet access and cable tv.<br/>It has magnificent view from the roof terrase and the pool was perfect. <br/>The hosts Dimitris and Nadia   were  waiting for us on arrival and helped with the luggage and getting us settled in. Very well organised with maps and heaps of advice of how to make our stay more enjoyable.<br/>All the conveniences are very close - the local shops , hairdresser, bakery, restaurants (with free delivery).<br/><br/>The charm and  readiness to help of both hosts give a nice overall impression and you just have to feel like at home.<br/>The overall experience was really great and we enjoyed our stay."
14500505,170186381,2017-07-15,27052452,David,Great apartment with spectacular rooftop swimming pool. Dimitris was exceptionally helpful throughout.
14500505,171566714,2017-07-18,122315625,Jeremy,"One word, Wonderful - I'll use this word a couple of times. Wonderful house, perfect location giving you views and privacy. The house is well stocked and wonderfully decorated  ; mixing modern art with vintage classic furniture. The rooftop terrace is an oasis in the middle of the city, with stunning views from the swimming pool. Dimitris gave such a warm, friendly almost family like welcome and ensured we were short of nothing. The location allows you to easily get to all center points in Athens and is in a very safe neighborhood (thanks to the US embassy being located around the corner). Again the house is well stocked and I would challenge anyone to find something ""missing"". We (family of 4; 2 kids of 6 and 9) had plenty of space and with 3 bedrooms all had there own privacy when wanted. We spend 3 nights and had a wonderful experience thanks again to Dimitris's personal touch. "
14500505,172426875,2017-07-21,52956535,Isobel,"The apartment lived up to and in many ways exceeded expectations.  The space is very generous with a lovely homely feel and Dimitris was the perfect host, full of great suggestions for what to see and where to eat.  We pretty much followed his lead and it worked out really well, particularly as we only had 2 days.  The icing on the cake was the rooftop pool, perfect to come back to after a day walking the streets of Athens.  The real treat was taking a dip late at night looking up at the stars.  Although it is a little bit out of the centre so you need to take taxis or use the metro (which both take only 10 mins) , it more than compensates with its quiet location and wonderful ambience.  Thank you Dimitris for a wonderful, if too brief a stay, we will definitely be back if in Athen"
14500505,173242480,2017-07-23,6125100,Jane,Dimitris is one of the nicest and kindest men you will ever meet. His place is simply brilliant. The pool is amazing. Dimitris was so kind helping us with everything and nothing was too hard. We had lost a passport and he helped us contact the airlines and get it back. He gave us some fantastic suggestions and ideas of where to eat. We tried to eat at all of them and they were awesome. I can't wait to go back and visit again. Thank you Dimitris you are the best !!
14500505,174728729,2017-07-27,66783674,Cesar,"Dimitris,  thank you so much for being such a great host. Your care and recommendation made our stay great. We really enjoyed both your place and the great city of Athens and surroundings.  Thank you again and highly recommend your place to anyone else."
14500505,176496646,2017-07-31,21956841,Patti,"This apartment exceeded our expectations. The outdoor space on both levels is so beautiful and the rooftop pool with a panoramic view of Athens just cannot be beat. Area is super safe and a cheap cab fare to any destination in central Athens. Dimitris is an amazing host and goes above and beyond. He helped us plan so much, and I 100% would trust him to help you plan a fabulous time in Athens too.  He suggested restaurants, organized a day tour, arranged a driver, and planned a day trip for us in Sounion - all were fantastic. We hope to stay in this wonderful place again! "
14500505,177497658,2017-08-03,67371769,Jennifer,"Dimitris was a fantastic host and the accommodations were just as described, if not better.  This is a great place in a safe and quiet neighbourhood.  Dimitris made sure we were well taken care of, had all amenities and were well equipped to travel throughout the city.  We were extremely comfortable and throughly enjoyed our experience.  This is a great place to stay to be embraced by Greek culture, take in historic sites or just relax in this beautiful home.  We will definitely return and recommend Dimitris' place to anyone considering staying in Athens."
14500505,180615918,2017-08-11,13865073,Jean-Pierre,"Our host Dimitris welcomed us in a very nice appartment in the heart of Athenes, very well furnished, with a beautiful swimming pool and wonderful view over Athenes. Appartement and location are perfect for families looking for proximity to city center while wanting to stay in a quiet and safe area, just in front of a garden."
14500505,183805379,2017-08-18,134741313,Nikolaos,"We had a great time at the Lycavitos residence. Because of its location (next to Lycavitos Hill and its pine trees) and its facilities (beautiful roof terrace with views of the city and swimming pool) it serves as a relaxing oasis within the buzz of Athens. We enjoyed the flat, the balconies and we slept well. <br/><br/>Visiting the sites was at an easy reach - we were there in August and used the car often as a member of the family has mobility issues. Surprisingly there was no traffic or issues with parking.<br/><br/>Dimitris, the host, was extremely welcoming and helpful introducing his flat, the neighbourhood and Athens. He extended his hospitality by providing fresh food, milk and other supplies for next day's breakfast. We are likely to visit him again in the future."
14500505,185624421,2017-08-22,75096968,Evan,"It's hard to imagine that there could be a more perfect place to stay in Athens...  Dimitris' home is spacious and ideal for a family of 4-6.  The main floor living area was well laid out and had lots of space for everyone to relax.  The large balcony off the living area, right beside the pretty trees of Lycabettus Hill, was the perfect spot for breakfast.  The kitchen was very functional and well supplied.  Everything you need (besides the food you buy) was there. The two main bedrooms were good size, and had AC. The third bedroom with 2 small beds was a bit tight and hot for our teenage boys, but it worked. <br/><br/>The upper floor pool and the views were unbelievable.  The pictures can't quite capture how amazing it is.  Every day started with a swim in the sun, overlooking the city - it is surprisingly quiet up there in the morning.  Every evening ended with a swim before bed.  Despite the hot days, the pool stays refreshing.  And after hot day trips to Acropolis, Sounion and Nafplio, it was great to be able to cool off and drink wine up there.<br/><br/>Location was good for us. Easy entry from airport.  A 10 minute walk down the hill there is an area with 2 decent grocery stores, a confectionary (Mike) that had amazing treats and also sold some better Greek wine, and a very nice outdoor restaurant (Flower) where we had several good dinners.  We wanted the exercise, so the climb back up was ok.<br/><br/>Dimitris is a wonderful host.  He truly cares that his guests enjoy their time in Greece, and he provides excellent suggestions.  He is a very ""active host"" and you will likely have some communication with him each day.  He arranged a guided tour of Acropolis and area with Nadia, which our whole family loved - she was full of energy, funny, and we learned quite a bit about local history.<br/><br/>We will definitely return."
14500505,189483294,2017-09-02,71593150,Mona,Dimitris is a perfect host! We had a very great time in his appartement. Even with six persons the appartement was convinient. We can recommend everyone to stay there and to enjoy the pool on the roof with the view over Athens :)
14500505,193785580,2017-09-15,32439006,Angela,"Demitris' wonderful Athean home matched him well; very welcoming, accommodating and full of character and style. It became our gorgeous, extremely well equipped, clean, luxury oasis away from the searing heat and tourist crowds and it easily provided our five family adults with all the space and intimacy options that we needed throughout our week stay there. <br/><br/>The private rooftop terrace and pool was an absolute joy to spend time in and the wonderful panoramic view out over Athens and the adjacent hill was the holiday highlight, by both day and night, and is something that we will never forget. Breakfasting out on the fragrant verandah was so pleasurable offering such a lovely start to each day.  The location of the property served us excellently in terms of safety and easily walkable distance to amenitues such as shops, eateries and various modes of transport. And at just €9 each for a 5 day integrated travel pass (on very efficient and extensive transport system) we made very full use of the Athens transport system via the local Metro stops, to tick off all the tourist sites and many lesser known ones. If you go do take really comfie shoes as you'll be doing lots of walking often with inclines but it's well worth any effort. <br/><br/>As others have already attested, Dimitris was a very kind, knowledgeable and generous host, both with the gifts of food and drinks that he bestowed upon us as well as with his time and recommendations, many of which we followed up and would urge others to trust in. The transport that he arranged to and from the airport was excellent for our party and his generosity on both waiting for our delayed arrival and generously accommodating our late check out was very much appreciated by us.<br/><br/>In conclusion, we absolutely would highly recommend staying here and would love to return ourselves at some future date for another fabulous holiday."
14500505,197249650,2017-09-25,118150584,Carsten,"The apartment is exceptionally stylishly furnished and offers plenty of space for large families. We enjoyed every minute there. Just take a look at the pictures that Dimitris has uploaded - they look already great, but if you experience it live it's much more impressive. Just the fact when you swim with the air mattress on the pool and look at the roofs of Athens is so beautiful you'll never forget.<br/><br/>From the apartment you can reach all the important sights in a short time. Nadia and Dimitris are wonderful hosts who have also given us many insider tips, so we had a memorable trip.<br/><br/>We will definitely be back - we liked it so much<br/>Folks, if you do not book the apartment, then you make a mistake!<br/><br/>Thx for all!"
14500505,199446949,2017-10-02,45311814,Spencer,"The flat is in a beautiful location overlooking Lycabettus Hill and with a view over Athens. It is a short walk from restaurants and bars and very quiet. The roof terrace is spectacular and the pool very nice, (and clean) unfortunately, contrary to our expectations, the weather was not good and we didn't really use these facilities. The bedrooms are nice and the living area very spacious, with comfortable sofas. The kitchen has everything that you could need. I would say that this flat works best in good weather when the roof terrace and pool would come into their own, otherwise we felt that the price charged seemed quite high. The one main flaw for us was that while there are two bathrooms the one that can be accessed by guests not staying in the master bedroom (which has its own larger en suite) is cramped. Overall, this didn't spoil our enjoyment of what is a beautiful flat but it was a negative point. Dimitris was an attentive host who helpfully arranged a very nice car service back to the airport at the end of our stay."
14500505,203373437,2017-10-15,31713372,Adrian,"The apartment was everything we hoped it would be. Comfortable, clean and functional– and the pool was sensational. Dimitris was a fantastic host, quickly responding to any communication and full of useful tips about Athens."
14500505,207503126,2017-10-29,43467715,Ashley,Dimitris was a great host. He was very easy to communicate with and very quick to respond at any time. His home was beautiful and very clean. Amazing views and the sunrise on the rooftop cannot be beat! <br/><br/>He helped booked a van for our larger group to get us to and from the airport. And never hesitated to help us with anything we needed. <br/><br/>We will definitely be coming back and will stay with him again! Could not be happier!!
14500505,213462593,2017-11-21,1971280,Jeremy,Perfect location. Very clean. Everything you need and lovely touches. Great tips for places to go. Thank you Dimitris! We will be back and in the meantime highly recommend this place to anyone else going to Athens.
14500505,253679761,2018-04-15,173780553,Andreas,The best host! Everything was great. Excellent hospitality. Incredible house!
14500505,257726050,2018-04-27,14011985,Ron,"Dimitris place is fantastic. Located on a hill overlooking Athens, it is spacious with great amenities. The pictures are quite accurate and the pool is fantastic. <br/><br/>Taxi travel in Athens is very cheap and needed. Most trips are 4.6 - 6 euros. I used an ap called taxi beat which Dimitris’s assistant recommended. It’s a great ap as you can text for an a taxi and it arrives in 3-10 minutes. It’s a better version of Uber with more information about the position of the taxi, the taxi plate # and driver information. <br/><br/>The food in Athens is surprisingly excellent. It’s comparable to Italy in freshness and quality. Be warned however, the portions are huge... There were 4 of us and we over ordered for the first 2 days. <br/><br/>In summation I will definitely stay with Dimitris when we visit Athens again."
14500505,261801505,2018-05-07,142361986,Chunyu,"The host is very nice and helpful, provide a lot of good imformation for us. The house is great, we were so happy to stay there."

14500505,269804531,2018-05-28,48302347,Ian,"What an amazing apartment and host! We and our four kids (aged 5-13) absolutely loved this place. Each day we would visit one of the sites recommended by Dmitri and then spend the rest of the day relaxing in the pool. <br/><br/>Dmitri is an excellent host, providing daily advice on what to see and do. On one day he also arranged an excellent tour guide at half the price of the normal cost. <br/><br/>The apartment is very spacious and had all the luxuries and facilities one would expect. The outside areas are huge and offer lovely views.<br/><br/>The hills to the back offer a nice contrast to the city and make for a good run in the morning.  We also walked up this in our last evening to see a spectacular sun set and eat a beautiful meal - our top recommendation.<br/><br/>The metro is just 5 mins away and so we used this to get around to all the areas of interest, taking 10-15 minutes for most places.<br/><br/>We use Airbnb a lot, this is by far the best we have stayed at. With Dmitri you get a great apartment but also an amazing guide who will be able to ensure you experience the very best of Athens."
14500505,272222633,2018-06-03,20283460,Claus,"The perfect base for your visit to Athens. Dimitris’ apartment is in a perfect location with easy access to everything you want to see and do in Athens. Dimitris welcomed us in person and gave a thorough introduction to both his wonderful apartment as well as great advice and ideas how to get the best of ones time in Athens. Quite sure he would prove a great tourist guide, should he wish to do so … !<br/>The apartment has got everything you need – plenty of space, all the practicalities of making your stay very homely – and then of course the roof-top terrace with the nice pool an immaculate views over Athens. A great spot to cool down after some hours sight-seeing. Also don’t forget to enjoy this view both with a coffee a quiet morning as well as with a drink in the evening with amazing views over an Athens in full evening lights.<br/>Dimitris assisted us with both efficient airport transfer and other practicalities and even called and checked in during our stay to make sure everything was fine and we had all we needed. <br/>Athens is a fantastic city – very lively and easy-going with great food and drinks places where you get a great a taste of the relaxed Greek atmosphere and lifestyle. Do visit – and do go for Dimitris apartment if you can. We will definitely be back."

Die Platzverhältnisse sind grossartig: 3 Badezimmer! Die Küche ist bestens ausgestattet, Dimitrios hat für den ersten Einkauf und Frühstück mit genügend Nespresso gesorgt.

14500505,279593293,2018-06-21,88565733,Jessica,"Dimitris was the best host anyone could ask for. He met us at the apartment, showed us around and even sat down and just chatted with us about places we shouldn’t miss on our short trip. The home was amazing! He made sure we felt like we were home and not just in a space to sleep while visiting the city. We will be coming back to Athens and making sure we stay here and spend time with Dimitris. He made our first visit that much better. Location was amazing and perfect for our type or travel, we like being local and just walking and finding things along the way. Amazing! "
14500505,283510608,2018-06-30,40812650,Paul,"This is a gem. One of the few graffiti free areas of this amazing city. An oasis of calm in an upscale area with all the amenities you need. Dimitris is a highly attentive host with lots of great ideas to help make the most of your stay. The views from the rooftop terrace are stunning, with a choice of eating areas and breakfast items provided which helps if you are not staying for too long. No  more than a €5 taxi ride from all the sights of Athens. One bedroom is a twin which might be an issue for three couples - other than that a truly memorable place to stay"
14500505,284728449,2018-07-02,30155324,Evangeline,"Fantastic Athens apartment with amazing pool for afternoon dips. Our family of five enjoyed Dimitri’s place and its fantastic location, comforts and rooftop pool and seating."
14500505,291674890,2018-07-16,73803852,Charlotte,"Beautiful apartment, very handy for an Athens holiday. Everything you need and large enough so that you aren’t bumping into each other constantly - we were a group of six and it was more than spacious enough. <br/><br/>Each bedroom is air conditioned so despite the very hot weather everyone slept soundly. The apartment is very quiet - you wouldn’t know there were neighbours. <br/><br/>Kitchen is well setup and it was handy having some breakfast stuff readily available. Plenty of information on good places to visit was provided and always someone available on the phone if required. It is a ten minute walk to some nice coffee shops and Greek taxis are very good value if you want to venture further afield, we never had a problem getting one. <br/><br/>Pool was fabulous - overlooking the Athens cityscape. So much nicer than sharing a hotel swimming pool!!! There was a minor issue with the pump but Dimitris resolved this quickly and helped us get swimming again immediately and stayed in touch in case of any further issue. <br/><br/>Thanks for a perfect stay!!"

But still only 15-20 min walk to center and all tourist spots. <br/><br/>All amenities included, water and even light breakfast. The rooftop pool was fantastic, clean and larger than I thought. Breathtaking views over Athens from the pool and rooftop terrace area.<br/><br/>Dimitris was an excellent host with great tips about sights to see and restaurants. Extremely helpful and ordered Greek food delivery twice for us."

14500505,328043464,2018-09-25,41574859,Tala,"This penthouse was so much better than any photos could show!<br/>From the beginning our stay Dimitris was super kind with us. We were late for 2 hours for our agreed check-in time (plane delay and directions) but he made it smooth for us. And for a plus he gifted us a bottle of wine upon arrival!<br/>The house is beautifully decorated,  and maintained. All the rooms were exactly as they show in photos. The space is big and the terrace and pool as well. <br/>On our second day of our stay, Dimitirs passer by with some veggies, eggs and fresh oranges. It was very generous and kind. <br/><br/>In short, our stay was so much better than expected, we're planning to book this place anytime we're in Athens!"
14500505,334759555,2018-10-10,3065112,Warda,Dimitri is a very helpfull and cool guy. He helped us with everything and was very easy to communicate with. We highly recomend his place to everyone who want to have some luxury in Athen.
14500505,337051886,2018-10-15,95090637,Agnieszka,"It’s a beautiful flat. It looks better in real life than in pictures. Amazing and unforgettable view from the rooftop terrace. Dimitris turned out to be a very nice and helpful host. He took care of us and he was ready to help us out at any time. We arrived very late (midnight), so the shops were closed and we were hungry. We were pleasantly surprised when we found the fridge full and a bottle of wine waiting for us in the flat. I highly recommend."
14500505,343059280,2018-10-30,87209128,Anna,Dimitri’s place had a great location with calm neighbourhood but near the shops and restaurants of Koloniaki. Our kids appriciated the pool and the sunny terrace a lot. We got very helpful recommendations for restaurants and things to see in Athens.
14500505,345515238,2018-11-05,174879374,Christian,Many many thanks for the great stay at your appartment. I really can recommend this host and his flat. His tips where outstanding! Would love to see you again!
14500505,351859361,2018-11-24,79633423,Carl,"What a kind and generous host Dimitris is! The apartment is luxurious and well-appointed in itself, but Dimitris personally provided the care and detail that made us feel as though we were staying at a friend’s’ place. We arrived late in the evening and he met us at the door to ensure that we settled in without a worry. From extra coffee, some breakfast items, even toiletries, we could relax stress-free and enjoy Athens. He even left us a bottle of wine for us to enjoy under the stars by the pool! The third bedroom was perfect for our teenager and the 6 yr old twins loved the double room. If you stay here, you won’t regret it!"
14500505,353244992,2018-11-27,63362144,Carly,"Excellent place and I highly recommend. Be aware of getting a taxi to the airport during high traffic times. Ensure you account for how much time you want/need. Overall, Dimitris was an excellent host. The place was very clean. His tips for travel were well worth listening to, so I’d recommend at least hearing him out. :)"
14500505,367195061,2019-01-04,15151836,Ashish,Great location. Great penthouse. Close to trains to get to center of Athens to see all the attractions.

The pool is great to cool off in after a long day out, and the outdoor spaces are perfect for relaxing. Dimitris was a terrific host, gave good advice and was always quick to respond to messages. Would stay here again!"
14500505,452475662,2019-05-13,249642305,Benedict,Incredible location and accessibility to the city. The view from the pool is even better than in the pictures and overall the house is very accommodating and a great space for a relaxing stay. I cannot recommend it enough!
14500505,455085794,2019-05-19,30072550,Fabian,We had a wonderful time at Dimitris place. The appartment and the rooftop (with private pool and view over the city!) are fantastic. The interior is stylish and high-qualitiy. Everything worked well. Dimitris is the best host you can imagine. The Kolonaki area is a chic neighborhood with a lot of charming restaurants. We will definitively come back!
14500505,469156685,2019-06-14,116282358,Ann-Iren,"We had some really nice days in this beautiful appartment both working and having a nice and chill time! Dimitris is a really professional host with good advices for places to visit, helping us with transportation suggestions - a really gentleman! The place is manifique, and the swimmingpool arena is a really beautiful spot with an awesome view over Athen. We also found a really nice restaurant with really good food close to the appartment, it’ s called SAH. <br/>Thanks for our stay in your appartment at Lykkabettus Hill!<br/>Ungt Entreprenørskap Telemark // Junior Achievement Norway, region Telemark"
14500505,474364380,2019-06-23,14285794,Grzesiek,"Lovely appartement, Very stylish flat in good area with lots of greenery on one side, and a beatiful view on the city from the other side. huge space, with plenty of air to live and spend time. rooftop with a swimming pool does the job, it's something exeptional. very clean flat, very clean water in the pool, so that you want to spend the whole stay just in the appartement. All beds are very comfortable and it's very easy to sleep as the outside area is super calm. I can fully recommend this place :) you will never find a better spot in Athens. The host was super nice and helpful, with pleny of recommendation where to go, what to see and when."
14500505,476411792,2019-06-26,179236064,Stephanie,"Our stay was incredible!!! The host was so helpful with everything from getting transportation, to sharing his favorite spots! The house is beautiful, and we really enjoyed the art throughout the house. There is everything you could ever need in the house, there were snacks, coffee, and even a nespresso machine! The pool was beautiful and gave us such an amazing view of the city, we got lots of great pictures!!!"
14500505,492277215,2019-07-21,139142615,Chris,"Amazing place. Great Host: place was quiet but within easy reach of town. The pool was fantastic. We used the metro to get in and out of town, and the electric scooters were great fun.  Hugely recommend this place, the host and the location: 5* all the way"
14500505,509172654,2019-08-14,90160977,Nicki,"Dimitris’ home was just perfect for our stay. Everything went smoothly and Dimitris was a great host. <br/>He was always just a phone call away if needed and was very helpful with giving us a map and recommended sites and places to visit, he’s very proud of his beautiful city!<br/>Most of all, as my daughter fell ill, he kindly allowed us to check in early while the cleaners were still there and made sure the rooftop bedroom was ready for her to rest, he also drove me to the local chemist so I could pick up her medicine and waited to drive me back.<br/>You will love the rooftop pool, perfect to come back to after walking around Athens in the heat.<br/>Thanks again Dimitris.<br/>Regards,<br/>Nicki"

14500505,525606704,2019-09-08,652337,Harry,"Dimitri is a fantastic host with a beautiful, nicely furnished place. Everything we needed for our stay was there and he had some groceries there for us, which was nice after a long day of travel. The rooftop pool and patio was amazing. Our host took the time to go over a map of Athens to show us the sights nearby. We were within a five minute walk of great restaurants, a bakery, markets and shops. The location is very, very safe with the U.S. Embassy two blocks away and the ambassador lives nearby so there is a large police presence. The apartment sits on a hill so you will need to be in OK shape when walking back. The hillside park across the street has many hiking trails and some very nice views.  We are all in our 60's and did not have an issue. The buiding has an elevator, which made getting to and from top floor with luggage a breeze.  Thanks again Dimitri for taking such good care of us. See you again next time we are in Athens."
14500505,532543690,2019-09-20,19107487,Rae,I can’t say enough good things about this place. Dimitris was an amazing host. He went out of his way to make our stay the best it could be. The place is worth every single penny. So nice to come home to after a day traveling and exploring. It is also very close to everything. Such a great location. The car service to and from the airport was also 100% worth every penny. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend this place to any of my family and friends. A true gem!
14500505,538720330,2019-09-30,236310541,Gavin,"A fantastic stay at this beautiful apartment. Dimitris could not have done more to ensure that our stay was amazing. The apartment itself is very stylish with lots of room and a lovely balcony for breakfast. Upstairs is the roof terrace, fabulous views and the pool.  Cannot recommend highly enough for a great stay in Athens"

14500505,636774250,2020-07-11,7889489,Martina,"Das war wirklich eine tolle Zeit in Dimitris Wohnung! Sie liegt etwas außerhalb des Zentrums von Kolonaki und damit sehr ruhig, aber dennoch zentral. Der Pool ist ein Traum, groß genug um sich dort gut zu bewegen, und mit einem umwerfenden Blick über die Stadt und in die Berge. Zur anderen Seite der wunderbaren, riesigen und toll möblierten Dachterrasse fängt direkt der dichte Wald von Lykavettos an, dadurch ist die Luft super, es gibt immer einen leichten Wind und man hat ein in Athen mehr als seltenes Wohngefühl, eben zwischen Wald und Stadt. Etwa 5 Minuten den Berg runter ist man direkt im Trubel der Plateia Mavili mit einer großen und guten Auswahl an Lokalen und Geschäften, wenn man geradeaus Richtung Kolonaki Square geht ist man etwa nach 10 Minuten an tollen Lokalen, Geschäften und Bars. Die Wohnung selbst ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und sehr komfortabel, voller Kunstwerke und bequemen Ecken. 3 Schlafzimmer und 3 Badezimmer plus Gäste-WC, die schon genannte riesige Dachterrasse und auf der unteren Ebene auch noch eine große ""Frühstücksterrasse"" mit Tisch für mindestens 6 Personen. Dimitiri hat uns den Kühlschrank gefüllt und uns bestens betreut. Absolut empfehlenswert, wenn man luxuriös mitten im Zentrum und doch grün und ruhig leben will - und wer will das nicht?"
14500505,649394938,2020-08-10,14965727,Frank,Great host!! Very nice place and well located. Amazing view over Athens at day and night.<br/>To have a pool available in the center of Athens is such a fantastic amenity.
14500505,655224442,2020-08-23,127248192,Sam,"Absolutely amazing place to stay in Athens - the location, views, communication and local tips and recommendations from Dimitri were all great. As this is his personal home theres nothing the house doesn't have, and the location is close enough to the nearest Metro to make it an ideal spot for tourists that want to be away from the city hustle and bustle but close enough to enjoy a few days exploring Athen's many districts. We wouldnt recommend the layout of the flat for children, as the stairs to the pool get pretty slippy if people forget to completely dry off and could cause a fall...but not a problem for a group of adults! Apart from this we cannot fault the place, every bedroom has its own air con, balcony and bathroom so there was plenty of space for the 6 of us and the pool was gorgeous in the August heat. Everyone had a wonderful time. Thanks again!"
14500505,662769660,2020-09-11,193712038,Luke,"Fantastic flat with exceptional roof terrace including pool, great for chilling above the hustle and bustle. Dimitris is hugely welcoming, very responsive to any queries and provides plenty of advice about your visit. Would happily stay again if in Athens."
14500505,673229058,2020-10-11,325195691,Roger,"""Great flat in a great location. Close to the center, at the border of the Lycabette hill from where there is a 360 view of Athens while in a very quiet and a very safe area. We were welcome by the host with some limoncello and we have enjoyed the spectacular view from the pool and the confortable living room. We can only recommend it! """
14500505,703499226,2020-10-25,7751305,Tineke,Het was een mooi huis en een fijn zwembad
14500505,756034507,2021-05-08,214089898,John,Εξαιρετική τοποθεσία με φοβερή θέα. Ο χώρος στην ταράτσα είναι απλά απολαυστικός
14500505,403292862110650359,2021-07-10,76101853,Sal,Excellent place!  Dimitris went over and above to make us feel at home and provided valuable suggestions on places to visit and eat and travel. you will know from the first day that he cares about his guests. He also cares about his house  The house is tastefully decorated with art and plants  It has balconies from virtually every room making the house bright airy during the summer months of Greece. The roof top garden is amaaaazing!  with the pool. What a great way to come home and look forward to go for a swim and then hangout with your loved ones by the pool with drinks desert and coffee. the rooftop pictures don't do justice. The roof top and the entire place is better than what it looks in the pictures. Our family had a great time in Dimitris place. We saw two islands and did the traditional tourist attractions of Athens and yet felt this place was worth every penny!  As all of us looked forward to jumping in a pool and hanging out after a hot and tiring day of being on Athens Street. We would sure to visit this place again when we are back in Athens!
14500505,411282118869687062,2021-07-21,17801460,Anne,"Excellent séjour.<br/>Appartement magnifique, très bien situé . Prestations de haut standing. Notre hôte a répondu à toutes nos demandes et a été de très bon conseil.<br/>Accueil très bienveillant.<br/>Piscine au top, très bienvenue par ces fortes chaleurs! Située sur un toit terrasse avec vue sur Athènes et le Lycabette.<br/>Nous y reviendrons avec grand plaisir."
14500505,421427687146250792,2021-08-04,206758395,Katia,Amazing place to stay. The host was very kind and helps you navigate the beautiful city. Definitely recommend staying here!
14500505,428004462557443047,2021-08-13,370641245,George,"This was a great and safe location and the pool cannot be beat, especially in the Athenian heat during the summer. <br/><br/>Dimitris is warm and welcoming. <br/><br/>Note that the pool filter is very sensitive so do not wear sunscreen, help keep the pool clean so you can use it every day. You will find that the Greek summer nights you won’t need sunscreen at any rate because Lycabettus Hill casts a long shadow over the pool. <br/><br/>The owner communicates clearly that because of the sensitivity of the pool filter, he or his team will come by for a few minutes every day to check the filter and clean the pool so you can continue to enjoy it throughout the evening."
14500505,430168113690205320,2021-08-16,173906655,Terence,"Great stay at this location!  We had a need for adequate space (3 bedrooms) and this penthouse more than delivered.  The view and rooftop private pool were amazing.  Even in the hottest part of summer, there was a cool breeze at night to both keep pool temperature refreshing and nighttime sleeping comfy as well.  All the rooms have A/C and they all quickly cool their respective rooms.  The location of this apartment is in a very nice location of city.  Walking distance to a few shops and restaurants and a very quick cab ride to acropolis area.  The host Dimitris was very helpful in regards to all the aspects of the unit and Athens in general.  He made himself readily available for all inquiries.  He made some food and drink available upon our arrival, so he is very thoughtful to his guests he knows are arriving potentially from great distances.  The cleaning person was there at our arrival (we were early) so this unit is always maintained well.  All things considered, the price for this penthouse is very fair and we will definitely stay here again!"
14500505,437407569873428936,2021-08-26,75415957,Neil,Dimitris made this stay wonderful from the moment I booked communication was excellent and when we met him he didn’t make us feel like guests more like friends. The apartment is amazing and the location is great. Would definitely recommend booking this apartment when visiting Athens.
14500505,445419754088163373,2021-09-06,77475259,James,"Let's start with what was great!  The upstairs terrace and pool - except none of the outdoor lights worked.  Ok, a few did.  The overall apartment is very dated.  There was proper cooking supplies.<br/><br/>The tiles next to the pool were EXTREMELY slippery after using the pool - and caution should be used.<br/><br/>The marble on the lower terrace - when the automatic watering system operated - left that  surface also - extremely slippery - like ice.  espeically if you did not know that the water had turned on - and it was dark.  BAD FALL!<br/><br/>The worst part was that the owner felt it necessary to come there almost every day!  Things at the apartment just did not live up to the term - ""luxury"". Toilet seat in the master bedroom was completely broken through - when we arrived.  (he did fix it! - but it was obviously broken previously - why to have to ask.  He gave us instructions on how to take care of the pool - yet he HAD to come every other day to check on this.  There always seemed a reason to come to the apartment - and he did not just enter, take care of his business and leave - he lingured.  Usually for up to 45 minutes!  It was too much!  As if he didn't trust us!  This is not what you want - to have the owner show up every day - and need to take care of something!  For example - the last night - he HAD to come to check the pool filter.  When I asked why it couldnt' wait until the morning - he said it HAD to be checked!  It was just too much!!  He is a very friendly guy - but it felt intrusive.  The kitchen had the necessary supplies - but again - was very dated.  Everything at the apartment is dated.<br/><br/>Be gave us specific instructions for watering the plants - but still insisted on coming to water the plants.  It was very strange!<br/><br/>When I take a luxury place - I expect to be left alone!  But he would come and stay and stay and want to talk and talk.  Not my thing!<br/><br/>It is overall a great apartment.  With a few thousand invested - it could be an amazing luxury apartment.  It overall felt like he didn't trust us - and had to come every day to check on us!<br/><br/>Even if I have great reviews from all other Airbnb hosts.<br/><br/>A minor thing - the AC remotes needed batteries.  He brought them - but did not change them out.<br/><br/>It was so intrustive that on the last morning he wanted to come to say goodbye - and we made sure to leave before he came - as we were certain we would be delayed by him.  And it was unnecessary!<br/><br/>It is a great place!  With some investment it could be an amazing place.  Not up to a $500/night experience!<br/><br/>Privacy is so important to me!  Yet he did not seem to pick up on this!<br/><br/>He asked me if we could talk for a few mintues.  I said no.  Then he proceeded to talk anyway!  Too much!"
14500505,448996055100132544,2021-09-11,215053772,Judith,"Een fantastisch verblijf gehad in de penthouse van Dimitris! De accomodatie is voorzien van alle gemakken zoals airco in de slaapkamers, handdoeken, badslippers etc. Het gebouw is voorzien van een lift wat een gemak is voor alle bagage. Ook is er een gratis parkeerplek voorzien. Het zwembad en het zicht op de stad is een mooie plus.<br/><br/>De ligging is ook prima. Wij hebben alles gewandeld (max. 40min) maar de penthouse ligt dichtbij de metro en de taxi is zelfs een goedkopere optie. <br/><br/>Communicatie met Dimitris is top. Hij geeft veel uitleg over de do and don'ts in Athene en is elk moment van de dag bereikbaar als het nodig is."

He helps with everything, is extremely generous and extremly knowledgeable in and around the history and culture of his country. We were unlucky with the weather, but the host and his house have made up for it big time! Highly recommend!!!"

This is a very good deal (at least for people like us who don't mind sharing their bathroom when other guests stay in the other room). I would absolutely recommend Anna's place."
14504553,102162168,2016-09-17,94086804,Geoffroy,"The appartment was perfect for our three day vacation in Athens. Just nearby the Archeological Museum and Omonia and we actually never used public transportation to go to Plaka and the liveliest places in town. Anna was very welcoming and caring.

Additionally, Anna took the time to offer suggestions about what to do/see in Athens and was always very responsive with any questions we had. <br/><br/>Anna's home is better than the pictures. It felt like a home away from home! The house was very clean and very comfortable.

She is very nice and welcoming and gave us loads of useful travelling advice. Will definitely stay there again if I am revisiting the place.
14504553,166718509,2017-07-04,18889052,Simone,"Ausgezeichnete Unterkunft an toller Lage, sehr sauber, ruhig und sogar schöner als auf den Fotos. Das Schlafzimmer ist gemütlich und hell, Küche und Bad sind mit allem Essentiellen ausgestattet. Der Wohnbereich ist sehr grosszügig und die zwei Balkone laden zum Verweilen ein. Anna ist eine sehr zuvorkommende Gastgeberin und hat uns flexible Check-in/Check-out Zeiten gewährt. Insgesamt ein perfekter Aufenthalt."
14504553,168215866,2017-07-09,58137410,Rita,"Anna was very hospitality and the room was very clean. When my sister and i booked the room we thought that the room have a privacy bathrom but this not happened, we had share a bathrom with o other 2 people. Maybe we did not understand well. Perhaps the room was confortable and we only staid in Athens for 2 days.<br/>The room's location was near of the centre but in a dangerous zone. "
14504553,170658483,2017-07-16,29050010,Luca,"Our stay at Anna's was awesome. Anna is a warm, lovely, attentive and communicative host. She was accommodating and generous when it came to our arrival and departure arrangements. We arrived really early in the morning and she arranged for us to pick up the keys at the airport. When we met, she shared with us some really delicious wine. This is a great place to stay for individuals who like to feel especially at home while travelling. The apartment is very clean, well-stocked with towels, and comfortable, and is located in a quiet street. It's on the outskirts of the colourful Exarcheia area of Athens. Exarchion Square is a five minute walk away and it's particular sociality is something to experience - lots of co-ops, alternative stores, low key bars and cafes in the area. It is an area with political affiliations. The food is great here, better than the more central areas, and definitely cheaper than at the main tourist venues (eat before you leave for those sites) The vibe is young, vibrant, and residential. This is a good place to stay for couples of young friends, and even families."
14504553,172174536,2017-07-20,9559516,Marco,"Il soggiorno da Anna è stato ottimo, la camera è molto ampia e confortevole, il bagno è da condividere ma non c'è stato nessun problema da questo punto di vista. Per andare al centro a piedi saranno 15 minuti circa, comunque in ottima posizione. Anna è sempre stata disponibile anche durante il soggiorno e ci ha consigliato alcuni posti dove mangiare, è stata un'ottima accoglienza! Consiglio vivamente questa sistemazione"

Overall very clean place and easy check-in and check- out!

Has very big dining, sitting room, entrance’ all very  well furnitured. Home has good  location near most of the major tourist attractions. Yet it is very quiete and relaxing. No any noice from traffic. So I used to sleep so well and relaxed much. <br/>Anna offered me flexible check-in time and she  waited for me despite my delay.  She offered me a warm, personal welcome. <br/><br/>- Anna is so compassionate, kind, caring and do everything to make  her visitors enjoy their stay. Always responsive whenever  I asked or requested for something. <br/><br/>-Communication with her  was always very easy. <br/>- She gives tips on best places to eat & visit. <br/>- I met Emmanuel once. He was also a kind, happy person. Guided me on the magical trip to Metoera monastries ( I recommend this higly). <br/><br/>Upon my request, Anna  even offered something extra. She used her professional expertise and skills to offer me  a good guidance and counseling about a life issue I had. Thank you so much dear Anna.<br/>I would like to stay in same place, next time Iam in Athens.<br/>And recommend it to other visitors."

Below the Hill of Muses, where you can watch the sunset and see the Acropolis. Public transportation for the subway and buses is 2 minutes walk down Drakou. Direct subway to the shopping district if you're looking for something.<br/><br/>Near all the sights, but isolated away from the crowds. The apartment is located where you hardly get any noise from cars or people while on the balcony. It's very peaceful.

Il y a quelques restaurants sympa en bas de l'immeuble ce qui et agréable après une journée de marche !  L'appartement est tout neuf est au dernier étage donc très calme. 
<br/>Le petit plus de cet appartement est son immense terrasse ! Alexandros était très sympa, flexible sur les horaires et il a même fait un petit guide avec ses adresses préférées . Pour ma part j'ai adoré le bar six dogs: c'est un bar les pieds dans le sable et plein de verdure agréable à Athènes .  Je recommande vivement cet appartement ainsi que son hôte . Merci encore alexandros pour ton accueil !"
14505009,99203213,2016-09-04,15593819,Liam,Compact apartment with big balcony. Excellent location just minutes walk from the Acropolis Museum. Balcony is ideal for sitting out for breakfast in the morning sun. Alex & George were very fast at communicating and available if needed. Flexibility for checking out was not a problem and much appreciated. Ideal base for exploring Athens.
14505009,100053786,2016-09-07,16558010,Xenia,"Charming appartment on the last floor with a huge balcony. Alex brother picked us up from the Metro though we were arriving late. He was very friendly and showed us everything. One can walk by foot to Acropolis and Museum. Metro, Tram and lots of car rentals very close. We had nice dinner in Drakou street. "
14505009,100218790,2016-09-08,6877466,Judy,Couldn't have had a better experience! Alex was an amazing host. 
14505009,101559968,2016-09-14,775409,John,"Alex was courteous, flexible, and a Dwight to work with. He came out of his way to get me the keys, and the apartment lived up to our expectations -- as described, and delightful. Alex's apartment is one is recommend and stay in again."
14505009,101571975,2016-09-14,4151838,Alice,"Alexandros' appartment is very nice, brand new, clean and in a charming area. It is close to the metro station and to a lot of restaurants.
<br/>Alexandros welcomed us at the metro station and showed us the apartment. He was very easy to reach and available."
14505009,102247873,2016-09-17,620245,Anna,"This place was perfect! I only had one afternoon and night in Athens and wanted to see as much as I could of the ""highlights"". The location couldn't have been better and the flat itself was wonderful! Clean and lovely, and the terrace, amazing. I only wish I would have had more days to enjoy it! <br/> Alexandros made it easy to meet up and obtain the key and took the time to show me places to go eat. I was able to meet up with my friends who were also staying nearby and we ended up at one of his recommended restaurants (the 360° Bar & Restaurant). It did NOT disappoint. <br/><br/>All in all a lovely taste of Athens, to which I will definitely return. "
14505009,104412318,2016-09-26,30116379,Nadine,"I travelled alone for business and can really recommend this place. I received a very warm and professional welcome and was prepared with maps, guides and tips. The apartment was very clean, the internet connections great & the bed is super comfortable. The area of the apartment is not so touristic, which I loved, so you can see more the locals living their normal life. However the fancy and touristic places are just two metro stops away. There is a ‘taverna’ (restaurant) close to the apartments entrance which gives an additional ‘security’ bonus, as people are sitting outside until late in the evening. I also recommend to eat here, as they have always fresh food and very honest prices. 
<br/>I had overall a fantastic time in Alex place & I really recommend Alex apartment.- Thank you Alex, I will definitely come back :-) 
<br/>"
14505009,105888921,2016-10-03,9869102,Tiernan,"Alexandros was incredibly helpful and responded to all questions quickly and thoroughly. The guidebook that he provided was fantastic and very thoughtful and the apartment is nicely located, comfortable and has a fantastic balcony. Everything was very clean and organized and it was a great place to stay to explore Athens! Not to mention that Alexandros was amazingly kind, helpful, and flexible when our flight out of town was cancelled at the last minute. Altogether a fantastic host! "
14505009,108031837,2016-10-14,11895998,Maria,"This apartment is newly renovated, gorgeous, cozy, in a very central and local location close to all tourist areas either on foot or by transportation. The balcony was to die for and everything in the apartment was practical,  enough electricity plugs, with all necessary amenities, great bathroom TV and kitchen. The apartment has a beautiful vibe, its bright, and the bed is so comfortable it has been the best sleep i have had in Athens. Although the apartment is very central to everywhere it is also very quiet which was very important to be able to rest.  Being on the 6th floor you have this free feeling that you are on top of the city, overlooking everything its very special and the balcony which is so large is the perfect spot to have your morning coffee or after wine and watch the sunset and colours hit the city. Honestly this is a  perfect spot to spend time in the busy Athens city - but feel that you are also within a local area and have some quiet time too. Will definitely return without a doubt!"
14505009,109548682,2016-10-22,11579206,Michael,"Our stay at Alex's place was just perfect! From the beginning Alex went out of his way to make sure our stay in Athen and our vacation was going to be memorable. He was always helpful and responsive. The appartment has everything as described and is perfect for a couple or one person. The balcony is big and offers a good space to relax. The location of the appartment is also great, only a few minutes walking to all the major attractions and restaurants. Would definitly go back there next time and we highly recommand it."

The apartment was a nice studio in the top floor with a large balcony. Location was very close to the main attractions and only a minute walk to the metro stop. Our favourite restaurants of the whole week happened to be in the neighbourhood (Balcony, Mani Mani). We recommend this place for your stay in Athens!"

Nous avons passé 3 nuits dans cet appartement et nous le recommandons. "

In addition to giving me directions and meeting me at the metro, he provided me with suggestions for what to do while in Athens. He put a lot of thought into his airbnb - I especially appreciated that he provided a hair dryer and iron! The location of this apartment is perfect for site-seeing in Athens. I would highly recommend it!! "

14505009,115374020,2016-11-24,4595077,Samuel,Alex was a great host- he met us at the metro stop when we arrived and showed us to the apartment which was nearby. Communication was easy and he answered all of the questions we had during the stay. The apartment is small as you can see in the pictures but it works perfect for a couple. The balcony is huge and is a great place to hang out in the morning or night if the weather is good. The apartment is also super close to the acropolis and other sights so it made getting around really easy. I would definitely recommend staying here.
14505009,116387531,2016-11-30,65557602,Maximilian,"Everything was wonderful, the location of the house very convenient for exploring the historic center of Athens, in ten minutes walking  i could  go to the Acropolis or to visit the amazing museum that is in the same area. Is located  near the city's most commercial street for shopping, subway a few meters away from the house for those who want to visit other areas. The interior of the house has a pleasant atmosphere, beautiful light, clean and well equiped, the climax is the large balcony overlooking the Attic sky. Alexander  is a wonderful  host, very warm welcome and immediate direct assistance when needed. I highly recommend"
14505009,116728383,2016-12-03,79226820,Claudia,"Really great place close to the major attractions of Athens located close to the Metro, shops & cafes. ALEXANDRA's is a great host & was happy to help wherever he could. Highly recommended!"
14505009,120877081,2016-12-12,106424264,Garrett,"The apartment is exactly what it is advertised as, I cannot recommend it highly enough. Everything works like a charm and Vassilis even waited an extra hour for me at the metro station once we discovered the metro workers were on strike and weren't giving rides from the airport to town, resulting in a longer bus ride. Alexandros was extremely prompt in all communications as well. "

14505009,123420401,2016-12-29,12926413,Ashley,"We loved our stay here! This apartment is on the top floor of a quiet building in a largely residential area. It has a huge porch set with table and chairs. It felt extremely safe at all times of day and night. It was an easy walk to the Acropolis, then on to the Plaka and Prisi areas. We walked everywhere and after seeing much of the city, we were glad to have stayed there. The apartment was clean and had all the essentials plus a couple extra things like a drying rack that proved helpful during our trip. The kitchen was well equipped and we could have easily cooked meals there. While inside the apartment is small, the layout was very efficient and we never felt like we were on top of each other.<br/>Check in and check out were extremely smooth, better than I could have asked for! Vassilis was waiting for us at the train station when we arrived and walked us to the apartment (on Christmas Day!). "

14505009,133842878,2017-02-25,21244397,Emily,Wonderful apartment close to the acropolis! Would definitely recommend it. The balcony can be a little noisy but we had a wonderful time.

My sister and I ventured to Greece for the first time for our joint birthday trip and Bill made every possible accommodation to make our stay amazing. From detailed directions via public transit to early check-in and including everything in between, we loved the clean bright lively apartment, the ease of access to the subway and short walking distances to everything worth seeing in Athens. The beautiful terrace after a long day of exploring was a cherry on top! We loved our stay and would definitely recommend to friends and family. A wonderful experience!"
14505009,146262645,2017-04-22,50547736,Roy,Great place with great location! It's small but it's perfect for two people. The balcony is large! The place is walking distance to the metro and acropolis!

The place is in a safe neighborhood and I felt comfortable walking around at night. Thank you for your help!
14505009,147896702,2017-04-29,21162858,Haye,This place is as it is in the photo's. Its warm and tastefull decorated. This is a perfect place for exploring the city. Its only a ten step walk to the nearest metro!! The neighbourhood is calm but also has some nice places to get a good meal or to get a drink during the day and night. Alexandros/Vasillis are perfect hosts and make sure you have everyting you need. Communication was really easy.<br/>We had a great time in Athens !!!
14505009,150915058,2017-05-10,57460696,Tatyana,"Alexandros is SUCH an accommodating host. He takes a real interest in his guest providing any and all information any one would need, whether it be about his place or Athens in general, you can tell he really wants you to have an amazing stay. If I do find myself in Athens in the future I will DEFINITELY be staying at one of his properties :)"
14505009,151488915,2017-05-13,17686281,Claire,"Alexandros's place was amazing. The location is within walking distance of all the most popular tourist attractions and is surrounded by many authentic Greek restaurants and bakeries. We didn't take the bus once while staying here. The deck is as great as it looks in the pictures and is perfect for having your coffee on, or cooking dinner yourself and eating it outside!"
14505009,152170329,2017-05-15,2249223,Maud,This is the perfect spot to explore Athènes if you are a couple.<br/>The apartment is exactly as described and really clean. The bed is confortable.

Bill was kind enough to pick us at the subway stop to go to the apartment, and he took the time to show us all of the sites and his food recommendations in the city.  We especially liked Kalamaki restaurant nearby for an authentic and inexpensive Greek meal - there were also tons of local cafes nearby to sit and relax. Thanks Bill and Alex for everything!"
14505009,154127806,2017-05-23,29882044,Marion,"Great central location w connection to the metro. Metro also goes to the airport, but only every 30minutes.

14505009,158506231,2017-06-07,71025018,Meredith,"This apartment is an excellent base to explore the city from. In the time we were there, we got around almost exclusively on foot. It's minutes from the Acropolis, minutes from the center... honestly a great spot to stay. The apartment has everything you could need in a really compact space that somehow feels just the right size. The enormous balcony is a great spot to sit out in the mornings or evenings. You can either cook for yourself (markets nearby) or grab a bite just around the corner. Communication with Maria (co-host) was amazing, she's a person who would be great to get to know! It's also literally one minute's walk from a metro stop, so getting to and from the airport was very easy. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat. "
14505009,159244765,2017-06-10,2665973,Daniel,Alexandros' home is in a great central location and surprisingly quiet. Alex's cohost arranged transportation for us from the airport and she greeted us on the street when we arrived late in the evening. Our first stop the next morning was the Acropolis and we didn't even need any directions; it was a short walk (past a convenient grocery store and great coffee shop) straight up the street. The apartment has a great balcony overlooking the hills to the south and may be as large as the apartment itself! We got takeout from the restaurant across the street and enjoyed it on the terrace at sunset. The neighborhood is very lively but when you close the windows there is no noise from outside. I would absolutely recommend Alexandros' apartment to others visiting Athina.

Zeer vriendelijke ontvangst door Maria! Toch een paar minpuntjes: de lift gaat niet tot helemaal boven en toen wij er logeerden was het vreselijk warm in Athene maar ook in het appartement, niettegenstaande de airco."

14505009,175079571,2017-07-28,69504838,Claire,"Het appartement van Alexandros is perfect als je slechts een paar dagen in Athene verblijft. Het is klein, maar alle benodigdheden zijn aanwezig, dus voldoende voor een kort verblijf. Echter raad ik het niet aan om eind juli/augustus te komen, aangezien het dan pittig warm is (35+) en de airco redelijk zwak is... Verder verliep de ontvangst vlekkeloos, co-host Maria wachtte ons op bij het metrostation tegenover het appartement en was gedurende ons verblijf altijd bereikbaar om vragen te beantwoorden en tips te geven over wat te doen/eten/zien. Zo gaf ze ons bij aankomst een kaart waarop ze bijvoorbeeld leuke restaurants omcirkelde. Ook hoort er een gigantisch terras bij het appartement waar wij geen gebruik van hebben gemaakt omdat het voor ons te warm was buiten, maar in andere omstandigheden zou dat ideaal zijn om buiten te eten!"

Maria, collaboratrice di Alexandros, ci ha accolti benissimo e dato dritte, consigli e supporto anche logistico. Dobbiamo dire che la location è ottima per muoversi verso l'Acropoli (davvero neanche 10 minuti a piedi) e che una piazzetta con dei ristorantini proprio all'angolo al ritorno ci ha anche salvato da lunghi giri e dai ""buttadentro"" troppo per turisti che ci sono nella zona appunto dell'Acropoli."

While it was cold at nights, we made sure to have breakfast outside. Supermarket to buy stuff is 5-10mins from the loft. Maria (co-host) was extremely helpful/responsive and all queries were answered in ~10mins. It's 10mins from acropolis museum and 15mins from the actual acropolis site. Again 10mins from Plaka, so lots of eateries there. The Uber from airport to loft cost us €35. Overall, a very good experience in Athens!"

Make sure to view the guidebook on the Airbnb listing as there are some good recommendations for food, drinks, and more. The balcony is giant and incredible, and the studio is cozy and cute."

Super responsive and helpful in both the planning process and as we were checking out. <br/><br/>Extra European converters for outlets were super thoughtful and helpful, and the place has an AMAZING balcony. <br/><br/>Location is *perfect* - just far enough away from the true tourist center that you aren't in a sea of tourists when you walk out, but very easily accessible - about 10 minutes from Acropolis and even closer to Plaka area and the Acropolis museum. About four minute walk to Acropolis metro station. <br/><br/>We really liked the restaurant that was directly across the street.

I communicated with Anna, who was very responsive and attentive to our needs. There is a large balcony which we could not appreciate much as it was rainy and windy when we stayed, but it is a nice space to have. Overall I highly recommend staying at this place."

The neighbourhood is very central, safe and close to many cafes and bars. Though it is very close to Acropolis, it's quiet and mostly local, which was what we exactly wanted. <br/>We will definitely stay here again when we come to Athens. ps. Make sure to spend time in the amazing balcony!!"

The terrace is absolutely lovely as well, a great place to enjoy some wine while looking over the city. The flat owners were so lovely and communicative, always responding right away. They even set up transportation for us from the airport and to the ferry port. Accessing the building was easy as well! Overall I highly recommend and would definitely return :)"
14505009,450010768,2019-05-08,17849650,Andrea,"We were so happy with this charming apartment. The balcony was amazing for the mornings and evening, and the walk to all the main city sites was short, but also far enough to feel like you weren't surrounded by tourists all the time.  There is great little restaurant up the street called Spheka. It was perfect for a quick authentic meal after our late evening arrival. Communication with the host, Maria, was very quick and easy, and she arranged our airport transfers for us, making things much easier on us after 24 hrs of travel. Would love to stay here again if I am so lucky to return to Athens."
14505009,451216479,2019-05-11,31148306,Marta,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Alexandros. The apartment is incredibly good located, in a center neighborhood with lots of restaurants and good vibe. The studio is at the top floor so street noises are barely noticed. <br/>The apartment is as accurate as in pictures, check in was really easy and they brought me an extra pillow and sheet when I requested it. The bed may be a bit small for two adults  but the rest of amenities such as coffee capsules, shampoo, gel and that incredible terrace makes it a good deal to stay in!<br/>Thanks! I will come back :)"
14505009,452828968,2019-05-14,46693177,Goh,"The host was responsive to our requests like helping us to book a cab for our early morning flight. The apartment is near the metro station and easy to locate. The place was small but cozy. However, the balcony was spacious and picturesque."

The balcony is huge, great views of the city.  The building has an elevator and the apartment is one floor above the elevator on a winding stairs, but easy to reach.  The neighborhood feels very safe and comfortable.  The metro is about a block away and there is a wonderful bakery on the way to the entrance.  Also groceries about two blocks.<br/>We had a great stay and are returning after a visit to Hydra and then the Athens airport.<br/>Thanks Alexandros and the two Marias."

14505009,458601425,2019-05-26,5506987,Steve,"We wrote a review one week ago.  It is a great place in a great neighborhood.  It is very clean and tidy and totally functional.  When self-checking in, the lock box has a black flap on the front to reveal the number pad.  Just slide it down to get to the numbers.<br/>Alexandro's place is so close to the Metro it is just great.  Check out the very good and affordable bakery two blocks away, it is great.<br/>This will be our go to place if we return to Athens."

A nice escape from the hustle and bustle of Athens, but walking distance to all the hot spots!

The bathroom is very small but good. We actually ran out of toilet paper so would have been nice to have more rolls. To get in the building is a bit hard but follow the written instructions! Keys are in the box next to the door where you will have to lift it for the key after putting in the code. Take the elevator to the 5th floor and then one more flight up the stairs. It is fairy dark on the staircases but there are light switches along the walls. Thanks for a lovely stay!

The balcony is big - nice to have breakfast when it’s not cold outside yet.<br/><br/>The AC is working for both cooling and heating, but heats not too much and is quite far away from the bed, so it might get chilly in colder months (it was ok in November, but a bit warmer would be nice). <br/><br/>There are kitchen utensils, but need to bring your own oil if you want to cook. <br/><br/>The hosts replied quickly and gave good recommendations for places to go.<br/><br/>I recommend the apartment if you a having a short stay and want to be as close to the tourist places as possible."

14505009,664280842,2020-09-14,99479458,Tilman,"All in all the stay at this apartment was very nice and comfortable.<br/>When we arrived we were a little shocked because the apartment was not cleaned since the last guests, so we contacted Alexandros, who told us that due to a personal incident the apartment couldn’t have been cleaned sooner. While the cleaning lady was in the apartment we left for a walk and when we came back all was tidied up and clean. Alexandros responded immediately to our request, the communication in general was excellent. <br/>The apartment itself is very well located, 1 minute walk to metro and bus and a ten minute walk to the Acropolis. There are all the things you need and the terrace is indeed very nice to relax."

Everything was good in our experience. It could be difficult to find a place to park your car but if you try a little bit more you will find it. :)

14517924,107599882,2016-10-11,14058605,Lali,Dimitris and his wife made me feel extremely welcome and were extremely helpful with carrying my luggage!! They were very flexible about my friend staying over which was much appreciated! The house is really cute: ideal for a couple or two people (with one on the comfortable fold out couch). It's a quiet but interesting neighbourhood - just a 10 minute walk from the nearest metro. Everything worked perfectly and I felt very much at home here. Thank you!!  
14517924,108912200,2016-10-18,96403747,Philipp,"The flat is perfect for 1-2 persons. I was there with my buddy and we had a great time. It is very central and so we started our tours from there. We hiked like 100+km in one week. The only thing, which can make u going nuts, is the neighbours dog. It can be pretty annoying. But it's the only negative point. I appreciated my time in Dimitris flat and he was a really nice host. And the bill was fair, too. To sum up, if u go to Athen and Dimtris flat is vailable, use it! ;)"

14517924,580111095,2019-12-22,290039793,Amy,"Dimitris was an exceptional host - always available when/if I needed him and he was incredibly helpful.  I stayed in his apartment for 2.5 months and I couldn't have been happier. The location is superb - in a lovely neighbourhood of Athens, 5 minute walk from Panormou metro, which means it was super easy and very quick to get to the city centre. The apartment was exactly what I needed and the double bed in the main bedroom was very comfortable so I slept beautifully.  I highly recommend Dimitris' apartment if you are looking for a place to stay whilst visiting Athens."

Το σπίτι είναι στον πρώτο όροφο και είναι αρκετά δροσερό το Καλοκαίρι! Είχε τα πάντα όσα χρειάζεστε για να μείνετε ακόμα και πολλές μέρες! Μπορεί να μην είναι καινούριο αλλά προσφέρει όλες τις ανέσεις που χρειάζονται! Θα ξαναέρθω σιγουρα και ειδικά μετά την άμεση επικοινωνία που είχα με τον Δημήτρη που ήταν πολύ ευγενικός και στα συν είναι ότι δεν είχαμε το παραμικρό πρόβλημα σε οτιδηποτε ζητήσαμε. Δεν μας ενόχλησε σε καμιά μέρα για το οτιδήποτε! Η τιμή ήταν πάρα πολύ καλή και ειδικά σε ένα μέρος που το μέτρο είναι στα 3-4 λεπτά με τα πόδια και όλα τα σουπερμάρκετ καφετέριες κλπ δίπλα μας. Σίγουρα θα το ξαναπροτιμησουμε

The house was clean and very close to local amenities and underground station. It had fresh towels, hot water, strong WiFi, TV, cooking utensils, cleaning products, very comfy furniture, and everything in general I needed. Dimitris was very polite, helpful, and responsive, and, in my view, responsiveness is of great importance when you try to get settled in a new place."

The entrance hides a very cosy, pleasant apartment, well-equipped, well-decorated just as mentionned in the description. It is ideally located in the heart of Athens, from the terrace you can see the beautiful Acropolis and its Parthenon, a real pleasure both by morning and sunset. Every important sites to visit are close and within walking distance. The neighborood is alive through the many welcoming bars and restaurants, shops etc. with a lot of pedestrian streets. What an amazing stay in this apartment, a beautiful discovery and experience in Athens that I can recommend with my eyes closed."

14528371,147899694,2017-04-29,122589970,Eric,The location was very convenient in central Athens and popular tourist locations such as the Acropolis are walkable. Sakis was very nice and took time to show us how to get to different locations on a map and gave recommendations for places to eat and visit. The apartment had a great view (includes view if Acropolis) and was very nice and we'll kept. The apartment has WiFi and air conditioning as well as dishes if you plan to make your own food. Sakis was flexible with our checkout time. He let us checkout later without an extra charge because we had a late flight.
14528371,148710428,2017-05-01,19325211,Alfonso,"L'appartamento è nella migliore posizione possibile per girare a piedi il centro di Atene (impossibile trovare di meglio). La vista sul Partenone è sensazionale, in particolare di notte. Anche se ingresso/ascensore/palazzo è squallido e sporco, non appena viene aperta la porta di casa, si aprirà davanti a voi un appartamento enorme per due persone, pulitissimo e ben arredato.<br/>Anche la comunicazione è stata eccezionale (disponibilità e tempi di risposta immediati).<br/>Se andate ad Atene in coppia è il massimo, difficile trovare di meglio."

14528371,150102851,2017-05-07,49169713,Grace,"Apartment was beautiful and spacious, just as pictures appear. It's in a great location and walkable to historical sites, shops, and restaurants. The host was incredibly responsive. However, if you check out early in the morning before the gate downstairs is open, make sure to unlock it before you lock up upstairs....otherwise you'll be stuck in the bottom entrance. Only complaint is that dishes were not washed well... several cups had coffee residue left in them which made me question the cleanliness of the rest of the dishes. It was wonderful to stay in this apartment and would stay here again. "
14528371,151546108,2017-05-13,112569297,Tara,"Amazing place and looks just like the pictures, possibly even better. It has a great location in the center of Athens less then a 15 minute walk from all attractions. I'd recommend the place to anyone. "
14528371,154778367,2017-05-26,3823747,Pasi,"I have to say this apartment was a total jewel! Looks exactly like on the pics, and the view from the balcony is amazing. There's even another balcony where you can enjoy the sun in the mornings. <br/>Just keep in mind that as soon as the sun comes us, the apartment gets very bright. No curtains on one side of the apartment. Still, amazing and would highly recommend this apartment. Perfect for couples. "
14528371,155558752,2017-05-28,14869989,Matthieu,"We had a very nice stay at Sakis' loft. The apartment is huge, very confortable and well decorated, and what a view on the city from the balcony !! Sakis was also very nice, he gave us a lot of advices and was here for any question we had. <br/><br/>When we left the apartment, we left the keys inside but forgot to open downstairs door, so it wasn't possible to get out... Hopefully Sakis was here to help us in the middle of the night, at 4:00am.  Sorry for waking you up Sakis and thanks again !!<br/><br/>We will definitely come back again !"

The kitchen is very well equipped and so is the rest of the house. Very comfortable bed and amazing modern design. <br/>The only ""issue"" is that is doesn't have curtains so the privacy can get a bit compromised.<br/>It is the best house we have rented so far and we will rent it again when we go back to Athens! "
14528371,163322314,2017-06-24,13968341,Stefanie,"Most probably the best airbnb in athens! I can only recommend it!!! Furthermore, Sakis is an amazing host and gives fantastic restaurant recommendations."
14528371,164473286,2017-06-27,4128473,Danielle,"My daughter and I loved staying at Sakis apartment. It was a very comfortable place to relax after a day of walking around. The location is perfect. You are right in the middle of everything. Tons of shopping, cafes, transport, and that big mountain in the middle of the city, the Acropolis. <br/><br/>The apartment has lots of outlets for charging, electronic sunshades for the patios, supreme views of the Acropolis, three AC units, and loads of space.  It occupies the entire floor. <br/><br/>The quirky:  the building is unique. We found it edgy and full of character.  It appears to be in transition, under construction, though we didn't hear any disturbing noise.  The elevator is tiny, but, welcome to Europe. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this apartment.  We loved it!<br/><br/>"
14528371,168268658,2017-07-09,131817030,Lee,"This is a great apartment - true to photos - with exceptional walkability to must see sites. For those that prefer the metro - it is just a quick walk away. The apartment has a great view of the Acropolis at night, which made for a perfect area to unwind after a day of sightseeing. <br/><br/>As for restaurants and cafes, there are plenty of cool places to choose from. A great resto - , a Gastro resto and cocktail bar - is literally 2 minutes away<br/><br/>Sakis was a great host and very accommodating. I highly recommend this location for those looking for great views and to be at the pulse of Athens' nightlife. "

14528371,186313216,2017-08-24,88752142,Mark,This is a great apartment with a fantastic location. You don't get much more centrally located. We were able to walk to everywhere we wanted to be and when we got back at the end of each day we could cap it off with wine on the balcony with the most amazing view in Athens.

14528371,189588949,2017-09-02,4282705,Aubrey,"This apartment is perfect! If you're looking for a simple and clean home away from home in the middle of everything, Saki's place is a great choice. He offered to pick me up at the airport, which simplified my travel significantly. When we arrived at the apartment, he did an excellent job making me feel at home and familiar with my surroundings. <br/><br/>This place is walkable to the Plaka, Acropolis, Syntagma, Monastraki, and Psirri with ease. I felt very safe traveling alone and would absolutely stay here again!"
14528371,190360074,2017-09-04,142626991,Lisa,"This flat in central Athens is great.  Very clean and modern in a wonderful location to discover all Athens has to offer.  You can easily walk to the Acropolis, the Agora and other ancient sites, the Monstiraki market and metro station for access all over the city.<br/> The deck has a side view of the Acropolis, so you won't need to pay high prices at a roof top restaurant for the best view in town.  The kitchen was large and modern, but I have to admit we didn't really put the appliances to the test.  There are no window treatments along the deck that runs the length of the apartment, so you do have to keep in mind the the neighboring apartments may see you walking around.  The air conditioners worked superbly, and we were very comfortable in the early Sept. heat.  The bathroom is cool, and there is plenty of storage so you don't need to leave your luggage lying about.  The building itself felt almost empty, like a few floors were not occupied at all. There is an elevator, so you do not always need to walk up and down 6 floors, but on a few occasions it did not work for us. Be careful because the marble stairs are slippery.  We never felt unsafe in the building or neighborhood, and the bustle down below never kept us awake at night.  We would recommend this flat to couples, or singles visiting Athens.  Thank you Sakis for a great place to stay in Athens!"
14528371,191965086,2017-09-09,130080061,Nicholas,"Can you say wow! Just amazing place with view of Acropolis which your only 10 blocks away from making it walkable but being in the 8th floor(US system) this made the views amazing. We were welcomed my our host Sakis which we arrived two hours early and he definitely made it easy for us by meeting us there and showing us all the amenities. Hand down the style and openness of this place is the best use of the loft! Host was working on the only wash sink so it didn't work and was in process of fixing but we ask for after our stay. The amazing loft was just that; AMAZING! Every floor/loft/place is different that what you can see outside or the entry of the building. The restaurants outside are great and the entry is located in a foot path which bikes and cares use occasionally. The two store fronts in the building are getting remodeled so don't be alarmed, place up where you'll stay is amazing!"
14528371,192740632,2017-09-11,6302918,Chaolun,"Sakis's place is superb! The apartment itself is very modern, spacious, and greatly designed in every perspective, AND the stunning view of Acropolis! We especially love the balcony, open kitchen and the bathroom. I'd say this place is worth every single penny we pay, and will surely come back again."

The front terrace with a view of the Acropolis is also incredible. Check in and out were both very easy. I would stay here again."
14528371,197321478,2017-09-25,269479,Femi,"Nothing further to add. Previous reviews are spot on. Wonderful spacious apartment located walking distance to all major ancient attractions in Athens.<br/>Breakfast at Estrella on the left on exiting the apartment 30m away was very nice .. 5€ for either a massive pancake dish or Omelette.<br/>All good and the host, Sakis was warm, punctual n informative on local places to visit etc"
14528371,198057482,2017-09-28,64444514,Steve,"Just an absolute amazing experience from the start.  Sakis was always punctual in corresponding with us.  He let us check in a little early which helped us from lugging our bags around with us.  The unit is spectacular...top of the line appliances and furnishings throughout the place and all brand new.  Place was spotless!  <br/><br/>Opened up the huge sliding glass balcony to a fantastic view overlooking the city and the Acropolis.  The unit is surrounded by the main shopping district, restaurants, bars, Plaka etc...  Everything was even better than expected.  Thanks again Sakis and we would definitely be back again for another stay!!"

The style of the place was very modern with a very urban feel. <br/><br/>The shower room (yes it’s a whole room) was very unique and well designed."

We were only a 15 min walk from the sights we wanted to see. We had no need for a car or Uber. <br/><br/>Sakis was a great host. Our flight landed earlier than check-in time, so he let us leave our luggage at the apartment before it was ready. He also provided a map and gave us tips on what to see and how to get there.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay here again."

We were a bit in a hurry when we landed on our schedule and he found us a trusted cab (who was super nice)!<br/>The location is great, you can walk around the inner heart of this marvelous city and reach the main attractions within few minutes. <br/>The flat is outstanding for furniture, design and view. <br/>Furthermore we followed some advice from him about food and places and they were great!<br/>We always felt warmly welcomed by the city and the people and Sakis gave us the first great impression of the greek kindness and hospitality!"
14528371,212790732,2017-11-19,22463393,Dan,Sakis was a great host and always available. His place couldn’t be better located. Close to everything. Easy to get around around. The space itself was even better than the pics show. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Athens.

14528371,248279770,2018-03-31,4592414,Sylla,"This is by fart she best place I ever rented on Airbnb and I have rented quite a few great ones over the years.  The location could not be better (try Paradosiako for simple taverna fare 5 min away and Loukoumades on Aiolou for great traditional sweets), perfectly situated between Syntagma and Monastiraki. There are two big supermarkets 5 minutes away on Mitropoleos St. The photos do not do justice on how airy, luminous, stylish and quiet the apartment truly is.It was spotlessly clean. Every morning that full view of the Acropolis stops one's heart.  It has TWO balconies to enjoy the morning and the afternoon sun. The kitchen is equipped with everything one might need. There are no neighbors so I had (and I have been coming to Athens for many years) the best sleep I ever had in the city here. Sakis was a very solicitous and helpful host, who after giving me the keys sent messages over the week I was there, asking if I needed anything. If I had, I have no doubt that he would have been there in a jiffy! This is an apartment for a couple or a single traveler, an apartment that can be described as a destination in  itself! I hope that I will have the chance to stay there again!"
14528371,251592899,2018-04-08,46618315,Torsten,Very nice and fresh apartment with great view in a very central place of Athens. Quiet place even though its in middle of Athens. Sakis recommended some good restaurant that was spot on :).  Great stay in Athens. Thanks! :)

14528371,257978321,2018-04-28,9715803,Kasey,"This is the best airbnb I've ever stayed in. First, Sakis is a saint. He met us at the apartment and showed us around but, more importantly, my boyfriend accidentally left his backpack (with his passport in it!!) on the last day as we were leaving. Sakis was able to come let us back in to get it and we made our flight with plenty of time. If it weren't for his help, we might not be home right now!! The place also is so amazing. I mean it is just as stunning if not better than the pictures. It is massive and the decor is beautiful, as is the view of Athens and the Acropolis. It is in an awesome location right near tons of trendy restaurants and shops. We literally thought about offering to buy it and staying forever. Thanks for everything, Sakis!"

We really enjoyed the beautiful, spacious apartment, made all the more amazing by the phenomenal view of the city and the Acropolis. We feel pretty positive that we had the best view in town. My husband and I were there for our honeymoon, and we loved being within walking distance of everything we wanted to see, as well as drinking wine on the large balcony at night while gazing in awe the golden-lit Acropolis."
14528371,280336577,2018-06-23,31508827,Dimi,This place and its host was nothing short but amazing. Location was awesome only min away from Plaka. Sakis was very responsive and easy to communicate.

From organising a taxi to collect us from the airport, to the warm welcome and a few extra special touches, he was fantastic! <br/><br/>The apartment exceeded all our expectations and the layout and design are amazing! Very clean and modern, the apartment offered us everything we needed and more! <br/><br/>The view though... that was extra special; we arrived at 11pm and the Acropolis was lit up in the distance and we instantly knew this was the BEST apartment we could have asked for! <br/><br/>The location is great too and a short walk away is the Acropolis/Parthenon and also the Acropolis Museum! <br/><br/>There were plenty of bars and restaurants local to the apartment too, all opened late (except {some} on Mondays)! There is even one on the ground floor... the smallest bar in Athens! <br/><br/>We cannot say thank you enough for our stay! Should we come back, we would be very upset if this apartment was not available again! It was fantastic!"

Sakis was easy to communicate with and provided some local recommendations and tips. The area was far enough away from the touristy parts of Athens, but within a 5 minute walk you were able to reach all of the main attractions! We loved the location! Thank you, Sakis!"

Shopping, the hippest new restaurants and the best coffee within 1-2 minutes walk. Of course all the key sights are also right there. The area is very safe as well. Sakis is also a great host - responds rapidly to messages and happy to offer local knowledge. His local dinner recommendation was some of the best Greek food I’ve ever had (& I’m Greek so that’s says something!).<br/><br/>And last but not least the spectacular view of the Acropolis is better in real life than in the photos. I will be back for sure!"

L’un des deux balcons a une vue magnifique sur le Parthenon. Les trois climatisations assurent la fraîcheur des lieux lorsque le soleil commence à taper sur la ville. Rien à redire non plus sur la literie. Notre hôte a été très conciliant et s’est très gentiment adapté à notre arrivée tardive (1H30). Seul petit bémol de notre court séjour : l’ascenseur un peu bruyant. Prévoir des boules quies pour les sommeils légers. Mis à part cela, nous garderons de cet endroit un excellent souvenir !"

You can’t beat the amazing view of the acropolis from the balcony.  His place also has all the amenities you will need.

I'd highly recommend this flat. Sakis was very welcoming and gave me some great local tips, most importantly for me to in avoiding lots of the touristy restaurants. It's very central, very accessible and there is a cracking cocktail bar on the ground floor where I spent lots of evenings!"
14528371,511221966,2019-08-17,22029588,Terri,"This was a wonderful place to stay in the perfect part of Athens. The apartment was very clean, spacious , and had a great view of the Acropolis. We did not have the opportunity to meet the host, but we were greeted by his very kind friend who walked us through the apartment and provided the key. <br/><br/>We were getting adjusted to the timezone and appreciated a quiet, comfortable place to sleep. The AC kept us cool on the very hot days. <br/><br/>Athens is very walkable and this apartment is perfectly located. There are many restaurants and attractions nearby. However, the apartment is in a quiet location, off of the main area. Don’t be deterred by the entrance and strange elevator!<br/><br/>We would absolutely stay here again!"
14528371,515523728,2019-08-23,38715466,Ivan,Sakis’s flat is amazing. Is near to the main turistic places. The details of his flat are wonderful.

The living area magnificent, everything in the kitchen, bathroom so big. Shower fantastic air conditioner worked. Then the balcony and the view of the Parthenon was magnificent. The bed was comfortable, no noise of a night. We have booked 4 more nights after our travelling around Greece. Sakis responded to everything asked."

The views of it breathtaking."
14528371,527957486,2019-09-12,4610593,Astrid,"This is a fantastic and fantastically situated apartment. Sakis’ communication as a host was efficient and super-prompt. The apartment itself was very well stocked, beautifully decorated in minimal and comfortable style. It is spotlessly clean and has the most amazing views. It is equidistant between Syntagma and Monastiraki Sq so everywhere is very walkable from the apartment. I can not recommend this apartment and Sakis as a host enough. Great value for money and quite honestly  one of the best Airbnb in Athens."

14528371,556379799,2019-10-29,2090728,Matt,"Sakis has an incredible space right in the heart of Monastiraki. The location could not be better - we were a comfortable walk to all the fantastic sights Athens has to offer, with plenty of shopping, eating, and drinking within a few steps of the building. It is a truly high-end experience, with plenty of thoughtful design touches, ample space, and a deck with a fantastic view. I think it is safe to say this is one of the highest quality Airbnb's we have ever stayed in at an exceptional value. Do not hesitate to book this place!"

14528371,566940134,2019-11-21,200483613,Shayan,"Amazing place! You have views from both sides of the apartment so you can see the sunrise or sunset. The view is incredible. I came for a place to isolate myself so I could work and think peacefully.  The place was very zen. I was able to meditate and do yoga peacefully as well. The internet was good too. I was able to do group video calls to the US pretty well, but sometimes it went down.  Also right dab in the center you were next to ermou, and 2km from acropolis. Overall, I got what I wanted. I felt inspired and got a lot of good work done. I would only suggest curtains for the balcony windows. I worked very late and could not sleep properly during the day because there was a lot of light. Good and bad haha. Overall I would stay again! Thank you!"

Be it shopping, dining, coffee shops, or visiting of ancient and historical locations. You can quite literally see the Acropolis from this flat. It’s simply stunning. The flat itself is very modern, open and relaxing. I was able to work remotely without any issues as the internet speed is quite good. As a host, Sakis was great.

If you're a foodie, you're right in the heart of the trendy restaurant and cocktail scene as well.  The apartment itself is spacious and modern (absolutely love the tile floor, by the way - little details matter). The view of the Acropolis from the balcony is so nice, you might want to plan a night in with a bottle of wine and watch as twilight gives away to the spectacular view of the Parthenon lighting up the city in all it's majestic glory."
14528371,450494112185066903,2021-09-13,6004429,Georgios,"Spacious, clean, functional, modern and so tasteful this apartment is your dream house. The highlight is definitely the cozy balcony with stunning view of the Acropolis. The building is a bit old but once you are up on the top floor you don't really mind.<br/><br/>Located in a lively, hip neighbourhood with a lot of options close to all attractions. Also the spot to experience the original, downtown lifestyle of Athens.<br/><br/>We can recommend more and better pillows for the bed though..."

First I opted for the airport pick up which he arranged. The cab ride went well the driver was informative and it had wifi in it. Now for the location, it is ideal...about a ten minutes walk to each location like the Acropolis Meseum, the temple of Zeus, the stadium and Syntagma Square. He also provided a map which made navigation so much easier. The place is well decorated and was similar to my place and I felt at home. My favorite place was the back yard where I enjoyed the bottle of wine provided as a welcome...very lovely space...only missing a hot tub...lol. It was well worth it and made my stay in Athens enjoyabe...you won't regret choosing this place."
14533431,104946071,2016-09-29,31042195,David,"The apartment was wonderful, in a nice neighbourhood but only 10 minutes from everything. We were picked up at the airport, only two euros more than fixed fare so brilliant for the convenience. Met by the very charming Panos who had suggestions where to eat or drink locally, and directions etc for main sights in Athens. Great Airbnb find"
14533431,105830839,2016-10-03,4364872,Rosie,Great base for exploring athens- really stylish design and a lovely outdoor area at the back. Our host was very helpful in making reccomendations and even booking taxis for us.
14533431,107076431,2016-10-09,14919496,Rojen,"5 stars in total! The place itself is perfect! Vassilleios' cousin (I forgot his name as he was mostly addressing my husband) was very precise and professional especially when giving us the tour of the apartment upon arrival and lso detailing us in the map the attractions and the necessary places we asked him about. The rest of the feedback on welcome wine and coffee, and a big bottle of water were all there. There is a bar in the corner, he door is in the other angle of the corner. 
<br/>
<br/>While it is true that the main attractions are nearby (we stroll daily to along the Acropolis, Placa and Monastiraki for days) we had to struggle a bit as a family with a 12-month old baby as we have had a push chair with us and had to cross at least 2 main streets, and considering the inconsiderate and reckless attitude of many drivers, not respecting traffic lights and pedestrians' rights, I can say it is is not the best location for our need as a family.  Should we have been a couple without a child, I could have rated also the location with 5 stars (all the rest has 5 stars).
<br/>
<br/>On the side note, we got our doorbell rang 3 times! One by a friendly neighbor from upstairs, unfortunately he spoke only Greek. Another from another neighbor at 5a.m. who forgot his key and another was a prank at 7a.m! The last two are not nice experience for the one with child(ren)."
14533431,108012881,2016-10-14,76526681,Linda,"Es war einfach alles Perfekt. Vasilieios lieber Mitarbeiter hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen und gleich gute Tipps auf dem Stadtplan vermerkt. Als wir die Wohnung betraten blieb uns der Atem weg. Alles so mit Liebe dekoriert und eingerichtet. Sogar ein Maler war vor unser Ankunft in der Wohnung und hat sofort alles vom Vormieter in den Ausgangszustand gebracht (am Sonntag!)  So einen tollen Service hätten wir nicht erwartet. Die Wohnung war außerdem sehr sauber. Als wir nach dem Urlaub die Fotos zu Hause gezeigt haben, konnte uns keiner glauben, dass man so schön über Airbnb wohnen kann. Außerdem ist sie einfach perfekt für einen kleinen Spaziergang gelegen, in dem man die ganzen schönen Orte Athens sehen kann. Diese Wohnung hat einen erheblichen Teil zu diesem perfekten Urlaub beigetragen. Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder!"
14533431,109336344,2016-10-21,54346190,Stefan,"Very good location (10 minutes from Acropolis Metro Station, 1 minute to a good coffee and good gyros). <br/>Very good checkin with maps and valuable information. <br/>We have also received a bottle of white wine and a bottle of water from the house (very nice). <br/>The house is very clean and all the photos are real. (Except the one with the host). <br/>Very confortable for 5 people with a very good price.<br/>Small issue with the checkout: on AirBnb is mentioned as Flexible, we agreed with the host at 13.00, but, on last day, around 11.00 he phoned us to tell that at 12.00 we have to make the checkout... not very nice.<br/>I recommend this house!! :)"

Everything is within walking distance and you won't need to use the metro for anything. We loved it! The place is clean, comfortable bed, amazing view, AC, etc.  Evan communicated really well with us but we haven't met him. We met his partner Anneta and she was amazing- super sweet, super helpful, accommodating, understanding, very hospitable- a truly Airbnb super host! She is meant to be a host :) I highly recommend this place for young travelers that want to be in the heart of Athens. :) Thank you Evan and Anneta!!"

<br/>
<br/>In overall, the suite is fantastic, spacious and has. Location is just perfect and the balcony gives you amazing view of the Acropolis. We grabbed a bottle of wine in a local minimarket, put on some music on the speakers from the apartment and had fantastic chill time on that balcony. ^_^
<br/>
<br/>Next time I come to Athens, I will definitely try to stay in this place again."

Besides, it has the perfect view overlooking the acropolis. The studio was extremely cosy for two and clean. There are many shops and cafes around the corner but is high enough to keep the noise to the minimum. What is even better are the hosts' great hospitality towards the guests, thanks Anneta and Evan! This place comes highly recommended!"

The views from the balcony are amazing, well to me they are. It was my first time in Greece and I'm planning to go back again and hopefully I can stay at Evan's place again. What I found really amazing that it is reasonably priced, for a guy traveling on a budget it really worked out for me. I highly recommend this place for your stay in Athens. Get out of your comfort zone and live like a Athenian at least for one day."

In this regard the location of the apartment is absolutely superb - the place is on the central shopping street and is a five-minute walk away from two public transport stations. It is also very close to the most popular tourist sights. I feared that it would be nosy in the night but thankfully it was exactly the opposite. The apartment is pretty stylish and is equipped with everything necessary for a comfortable stay. The hosts were extremely kind and very helpful too. I wholeheartedly recommend you this place, I would definitely come here again! ;)"

It's really just two steps away from the Monastiraki metro station which is located at the blue line (the same line with the Airport so you won't have to do any transfers from the Airport! if you take the metro of course) <br/><br/>Evan is a collector so his house is full of unique lamps ! Interesting <br/><br/>Anneta was the one who welcomed us and honestly, she's the brightest person ever ! She was so kind and even offered to help us find another place for another night (we didnt planned on detail for this vacation so we had some troubles)<br/><br/>She gave us information regarding busses to get to the Airport and so much more ! <br/><br/>And Evan's place has this thing called mattress warmer? i guess. But that thing rocks ! It keeps your bed warm and it made it so hard to leave the bed ! <br/><br/><br/>You can see the Parthenon from the balcony ! <br/><br/>There's a lot of shops and restaurants like just below Evan's place so no worries about food ! <br/><br/><br/>Overall, it's just great ! I have no other words.<br/>"

Really good idea to provide electric blankets for the cold in winter; and to have 'soundproof' glasses in the balcony's windows,  'cause the area is really animated at night. The only thing to improve is the entrance to the place,  'cause it may be a little confuse. Thank you Evan,  we had a great time!"
14583913,137407140,2017-03-15,47146368,Carly,"What a great find! Excellent location, excellent value and spacious for a downtown apt. We were able to walk to all the major sites and come back easily if we needed something. The wifi was very fast and reliable and there's a beautiful view outside on the balcony. Would highly recommend."

14583913,139047830,2017-03-23,47146368,Carly,We stayed here again after we visited the Islands on our trip to Fly back out of Athens. Anneta and Evan are great and so friendly! We appreciated their hospitality and the apartment is so centrally located with a lot of space. Very reasonably priced for the convenience to shops and sights. Book here!

14583913,140845507,2017-04-01,104262114,Jiahui,It's located in a commercial block with many nice restaurants and bars but not noisy inside the studio. And it's only 15 minite's walk to Parthenon. I cannot imagine a nice stutio with such a price. The room is clean.
14583913,141454323,2017-04-03,26067554,Julien,"un appart au top, tres propre et tres bien décoré. un quartier vivant mais l'appartement est tres bien isolé et au 5eme etage.<br/>a perfect place to discover Athen!"

14583913,143464179,2017-04-12,117655935,Danielle,"Evan's place was wonderful and exactly what we were looking for. It was right in the middle of downtown, super close to the Acropolis, and there was plenty of food and shopping in the immediate area. The space was beautiful and Evan was a great host. I would definitely go back!"
14583913,146024769,2017-04-21,33061077,Jessie,"Great place, clean and fun with amazing personal touches.  Loved being able to play our music whilst sitting on the balcony viewing the Acropolis and eating a delicious breakfast from the great value cafes below. It's a busy area but the windows were good so it was fairly quiet in the apartment at night. Water pressure for the shower was also fantastic! All the historic sites we wanted to visit were within walking distance and we only used the metro once or twice. Highly recommend Evan as a host and this apartment.<br/>Jess and Kate, UK"
14583913,147356227,2017-04-26,4978721,Heidi,We had a great time at Evan's place. The location can't be beaten and it has stunning views of the city. It was clean and tidy and roomy. Thanks!

14583913,148216556,2017-04-30,63674693,Bdx316,A really COOL studio with a lot of musical stuffs and delicate decoration. It is situated in the center of all the historical sites and the host is really hospitable. 
14583913,150074595,2017-05-07,19614336,Polina,"Es kann wirklich kaum besser sein. Die Wohnung liegt so zentral wi es geht, mit einem atemberaubenden Blick auf den Akropolis, und wörtlich wenige Schritte von tollen Cafes, Restaurants und Shops, als auch Sehenswürdigkeiten. Der Raum ist groß genug und hell, mit einem bequemen Bett. Wir wurden von Anetta herzlich und gastfreundlich begrüßt, fühlten uns sehr wohl und willkommen. Definitiv nächstes Mal wieder, und auch an alle Freunde empfohlen :)"
14583913,150728376,2017-05-09,113121694,Shuyi,This place was great! The location was a very short walk from the train station and you could see the acropolis from the terrace. Evan was very nice and even helped us store our bags the day we checked out so we could explore athens and come back to pick them up before we headed to the airport! 
14583913,150946058,2017-05-10,51531603,Bobby,Evan's place was so great that we stayed on 2 different occasions during our trip. Great communication and awesome place!
14583913,151257555,2017-05-12,115021768,Kara,First airbnb experience and it went great. Location was perfect and easy to walk to everything. Would stay again for sure. Only issue was the bed wasn't the best but after walking all day I could have slept anywhere ! 
14583913,152706816,2017-05-18,1500944,Mary,"Evan's place is smack right in the city.  There are plenty of shops and restaurants around and the best is it is close to Acropolis.  In fact all the sights are just walking distance.  After a day of sightseeing, enjoy the evening on the balcony with a cup of Bubbletale from downstairs and watch the world go by.  It is the best bubbletale we have tasted.  A very comfortable home away from home."
14583913,152895726,2017-05-19,93946914,Ross,"Great central spot, close walking to everything in central Athens. Lots of restaurants nearby and very close to the acropolis. <br/><br/>"
14583913,154139252,2017-05-23,102292633,Azure,Great location for touring around Athens. Close to lots of food spots too.  A little tricky to find at night but host was very responsive. 
14583913,155300588,2017-05-28,7853077,Sara,"The perfect location: right in the centre of everything, less than 10 minutes on foot from the metro station, close to the best cafes and restaurants we found in Athens. The view from Evan's balcony is THE BEST! The acropolis at night is breathtaking. There's a fridge and a kettle, and everything else can be found nearby (shops, cafes, restaurants). The gyros from Tylixto (literally just downstairs) are not to be missed, and Fontana (also downstairs) does a great breakfast deal. The apartment was clean and the furniture quirky and modern. There's a lift to reach the 5th floor, but we found the 110 steps were excellent to burn all the calories accumulated eating delicious Greek food! The street is quite lively, so expect some noise at night - not too bad if you close the windows and turn on the air conditioning, though. Evan was always available to answer our questions by text/e-mail, and the check-in/check-out process went smoothly. We would definitely come back to his apartment, it was perfect!"
14583913,155860302,2017-05-29,90234881,Shannon,Evan is a great host and we had no problem meeting with him to check in! The location of the apartment is superb. It is a great value for the cost especially considering the view of the Parthenon from the balcony. We easily walked over to the acropolis and were surrounded by many options for dinner! Thanks for having us!! 
14583913,156280429,2017-05-30,80175975,Lyle,"Place was nice and clean, although we had to wait abit to be let in to the apartment other than that evan is a fantastic host with a nice cozy apartment "

14583913,158266089,2017-06-06,88919917,Rachel,"Really close to everything. Had trouble finding the place as it's inside a store, but once the host arrived, everything went well!"
14583913,158499868,2017-06-07,17354581,Martin And Sheila,"Evan's apartment is a real find, central with great views and a great space too."
14583913,159164140,2017-06-10,64223543,Joao,"Is the house the best looking one? No, definitely not. However, if you pick this location to be near, and I mean walking distance near, everything Athens has to offer then you're in for a treat. It's 2min way from Monastiraki station. Has nice cafes and restaurants nearby, the host is responsive and helpful. Thank you for your hospitality!"
14583913,160871936,2017-06-16,41142264,Alice,"The location is priceless - just look outside and you'll see the Acropolis! The flat has really unique furniture, and was spotlessly clean. The perfect spot for a few nights in Athens, although we stopped just for one."
14583913,161404231,2017-06-18,70683277,Zoe,Great location! Evan was helpful during check-in. I loved the collection of lamps!
14583913,161997619,2017-06-19,48677382,Brittany,"Excellent location - extremely close to the metro, market, shops, restaurants, and Acropolis, and only 40 minutes from the airport and 20 from Piraeus port. Annetta was a lovely hostess. We hope to stay again!"
14583913,162285026,2017-06-20,134731625,Jiyeon,호스트가 친절하고 좋았지만 무엇보다도 위치가 좋았어요. 
14583913,162936426,2017-06-23,111748598,Mary,"Evan was an outstanding host. My plans changed at the last minute and I forgot to inform him, and even though it was my fault, he came earlier than scheduled so we could check in and get out of the heat. He was absolutely wonderful in every way, and the apartment was just as advertized, with a fantastic view of the acropolis. It was actually a little bigger than it looks in the photos! Air conditioner works great, which was very important in June. Watch out for the balcony door - when you turn the handle up, it opens at the top, which made us think we'd somehow knocked it off the hinge. Turns out it's supposed to do that! Evan showed up late in the evening to fix it for us, which only took 15 seconds. We felt pretty stupid, but were impressed that he made the trip to check it out. Oh, and the location was AMAZING! There are some great places for breakfast right downstairs, as well as some dessert and Gelato. It's super close to the markets and metro station, and it's less than 15 minutes' walk to the Acropolis steps. We were lucky to have booked this place!"
14583913,163202572,2017-06-24,66599538,Isabel,El piso está muy bien ubicado con increíbles vistas y se corresponde 100% al anuncio. El anfitrión Evan fue súper simpático y siempre disponible. Todo correcto :)
14583913,164034239,2017-06-26,17354581,Martin And Sheila,Great place to stay in the centre of athens
14583913,165143024,2017-06-30,7084618,Kayla, Very nice and clean. Note that it is a 40 min train ride to the airport. 
14583913,165552095,2017-07-01,104432700,Paola,"Centralissimo appartamento adatto soprattutto per i brevi soggiorni, perché è vicinissimo all'acropoli (si raggiunge a piedi) e alla metro di Monastiraki, nodo principale per tutte destinazioni.<br/>In via pedonabile ricca di ristorantini e bar e al mercatino delle pulci.<br/>Lo stabile e l'ascensore vedono il segno del tempo, ma l'appartamento è carino e pulito.<br/>completo di tutto tranne piano cottura, lo dico perché dalla descrizione non si capisce.<br/>Grazie a Evan per la gentilezza e la disponibilità dimostrata. spero di tornare presto."
14583913,167221724,2017-07-06,65264990,Kiley,Great place! Close to everything we needed and Evan was wonderful!
14583913,171186947,2017-07-17,89967510,Chris,"Evan's place is absolutely amazing. It's right in the heart of Athens near public transport and some of the best restaurants. The view from the balcony was unbelievable. All the facilities were perfect. Evan was also so accommodating with the check-in time, we arrived early and were ablento leave put bags nearby until check in. We have stayed in Athens many times before and this was by far the best location and apartment. We will definitely stay here again."
14583913,174444209,2017-07-26,94665269,Priscilla N.E.,"De locatie is fantastisch. Centraler in de stad kun je niet zitten. Alles op loopafstand. Evan is een goede host en komt zijn afspraken na. Het appartement is super. Op de hoogste verdieping, te bereiken met een klein liftje. Uitzicht fantastisch. Beneden in de oudste bekende winkelstraat waar je al je eten kunt kopen en drinken of uiteten. Natuurlijk het fantastisch appartement met uitzicht over de stad én Acropolis. Wifi doet het fantastisch. Airco heel goed. Gelukkig, want het was 38 graden in Athene. Kleine douche. Goeie koelkast met vriesvak. Speelautomaat was kapot. Onze dochter sliep op de slaapbank. Voor een paar nachten was dat prima. <br/>Zeker voor deze prijs: uitstekend en een aanrader!"
14583913,174738863,2017-07-27,4132322,Stefano,"Evan si è rivelato un host gentilissimo. Il suo appartamento è davvero delizioso e confortevole. Arredato con stile, luminoso, pulito, aria condizionata e tv al plasma molto grande. Ma la vera chicca è il balcone: si affaccia direttamente sul Partenone! Una delle cose più romantiche mai provate, ad un prezzo che definirei quasi irrisorio... <br/>Un'esperienza da ripetere al più presto. Grazie Evan!<br/><br/>Stefano e Paolo da Roma"
14583913,176973908,2017-08-01,43675546,Hugo,"Great apartment, very centrally located, beautiful view of the Acropolis! Minor comment: the boiler for the hot water and the air conditioning can't both run at the same time."
14583913,178392420,2017-08-05,40991682,Jhay,Awesome place. Best area for a romantic view of the acropolis. The room is funky and big. Cleanliness was top notch and the location is perfect.
14583913,179752114,2017-08-08,28611745,Maria,Vi havde et rigtig dejligt ophold i Evans lejlighed. Det eneste der manglede var noget mere kommunikation fra Evans side når vi skrev til ham. For eksempel da vi tjekkede ud ville det have været rart med en tilbagemeldning. Men vi anbefaler virkelig at bo i Evans lejlighed midt i Athens. 
14583913,181090444,2017-08-12,37570625,Courtney,Evan's place was beautiful! Great view of the acropolis! Very accommodating! Thank you

14583913,182194959,2017-08-14,33765633,Laurie,Super appart très bien placé. On a pu tout faire à pied et la deco nous a beaucoup plu. Très bon accueil également.
14583913,182720381,2017-08-15,3135288,Laura,Very nice and well located place in Athen. The neighborhood is full of bars and restaurants. Evan was very friendly and the communication was perfect. We recommand it!

14583913,186006215,2017-08-23,30769718,Irini,"Evan's studio is in a great location, right in the middle of the Monastiraki and Plaka areas, and very close to the metro, making it very handy for getting to and from the airport. Being on the 5th floor (with lift)), you don't hear much noise from the street. The view of the Acropolis, from the balcony, is a wonderful bonus! The place is clean, the air con works, the bed is comfortable, and although there is no oven, there are so many eateries on your doorstep there's no need to cook. Evan was a helpful and friendly host. I would definitely visit again."
14583913,186279160,2017-08-24,121931741,Bailey,"We only stayed one night, but the room was large and the perfect downtown location for seeing Athens!"

He even held our bags for us while we continued exploring before or flight left. Excellent views and walking distance to a lot of shops and restaurants."
14583913,187940929,2017-08-28,72071459,Caylee,"Really great place, exactly like the pictures. The location and view of the Acropolis from the balcony are amazing! Evan met us at 11.30pm to show us in and was very welcoming."

14583913,191048638,2017-09-06,32026719,Julie,"Just as the listing described. We wanted something a bit different in the heart of the city and that is what we got. The view from the balcony is as good or better than the photos. A few finishing touches on the place would make it even better. No cooking facilities but with so many good cheap eateries around we didn't miss that at all. This is a really fun place to stay. Don't get excited by the game console in photos though, it doesn't work.<br/>We would definitely stay here again if we back to Athens. We loved it."
14583913,191376120,2017-09-07,26121088,Maria,"Nice and very clean apartment in the centre of Athens, the perfect starting point to explore the city. Evan was a great host, great at communicating and gave us excellent recommendations, and we simply loved what he did with the place and its decoration. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to explore the city and we can't wait to come back."
14583913,191927292,2017-09-09,18204870,Yael,Amazing apartment! Super cool and hip apartment exceeded any expectations we had. It is right  in the center of everything !!! Short walk to the acropolis everything is in super close walking distance super close to metro. Super comfortable to get to and to be in. We had an amazing time and really enjoyed our stay. The view of the acropolis from the apartment is breathtaking ! Evan was great super nice and awesome. Highly recommend staying in Evans apartment!!!
14583913,192740760,2017-09-11,33461594,Benjamin,This apartment was in the perfect location. Steps away from the metro station made travel from the airport easy.  Tons of restaurants near by and we always felt safe. <br/><br/>But really you should rent this apartment because of the view. It's better than the pictures show!
14583913,193134494,2017-09-12,61176637,Leona,"Evans place was in such a central location, in the middle of it all! We had a great time!

14583913,194543866,2017-09-17,128583765,Edin,Es war zwar nur ein Nacht. Und hat es aber sehr gefreut so zentral zu sein. Viele wunderbare Plätze schnell zu erreichen. Und das Gefühl mittendrin zu sein. Unkomplizierte Kommunikation. <br/>Wir haben uns bei Evan wohlgefühlt. Sollte eine weiterer Besuch anstehen gerne wieder bei dir Evan.
14583913,195576101,2017-09-20,45112928,Suzana,Excellent view and location was amazing! We had an awesome time in Athens. :) Evan was very responsive and friendly. Would definitely recommend!

14583913,199591217,2017-10-02,117359043,Neda,"Great location if your looking to take in all the historical sites. Definitely has a funky feel to the unit with unique style and furniture. The mattress is a bit springy and the hot water needs to be turned on much earlier than you want to take a shower (at least twenty minutes). There wasn't enough tp for our stay, and the lightning in the unit was quite dim. Some of the listed features were unavailable for example there was no iron, very little soap and we only received two towels for our entire stay. It is a very spacious unit and has a wonderful balcony with a nice view of the Parthenon. Evan seemed like a friendly host and it was a pleasure meeting him. Overall it's in a great location, but the unit could use some updates."
14583913,199904262,2017-10-03,141673951,Theodora,The location could not be better. Right on top of restaurants and cafes and in walking distance to public transport. With the acropolis in sight at the balcony a truly memorable stay.

14583913,202151932,2017-10-10,71994900,Kayleigh,"Evan's spot is in a great location with a great view! You are two blocks from the metro station that connects right to and from the airport. You are also walking distance to the plaka and the Acropolis. It is the perfect spot for those looking to spend most of their time exploring Athens, not in the apartment. <br/><br/>Evan is also really great with communication! We didn't get to Athens until 10pm the night of check in and he was able to meet us and walk us through the apartment right away. All in all, very accommodating and a great little spot for an adventure!"

14583913,202813493,2017-10-13,147749377,Raffaela,"Highly recommend! The apartment is so central, it's crazy how close everything is. They are super sweet and the apartment is stylish and cozy. We had a wonderful time :)"
14583913,203470044,2017-10-15,132474632,Mayuri,"Nice home and perfect location, 5 mins walk from monastiraki metro and right on the shopping street."
14583913,205496126,2017-10-22,36301622,Arendse,Great place in the middle of Athens.
14583913,206140355,2017-10-24,113327517,Natalie,Evan was so helpful and his home was so close to everything! He gave us great local tips on where to eat and was very friendly. The location was so perfect because it's right around the corner from the metro and right in the middle of town.
14583913,207857554,2017-10-30,37862080,Raquel,"Alles war perfekt! Wunderschöner Blick aus den  Balkon, wo man nach eine Tag voller Erlebnisse, ein Wein trinken kann. Die Wohnung ist super gut situierten, mit einer fülle von Einkaufsmögligkeiten und top Metro Verbindung zum Flughafen.<br/>Einfach nur empfehlenswert!"
14583913,208350736,2017-11-01,74368219,Ronnie,"This may have been the best AirBNB I’ve ever stayed at.  The location was perfect, the view was amazing, the layout and design of the studio was very stylish, the host was amazing, and the price was unbeatable! If we ever make it back to Athens this will be the first place we try to stay.  Thank you sooo much for making our short time in Greece perfect!"
14583913,208617619,2017-11-02,72766815,Kate,My friend and I actually stayed here twice on our tour around Greece. We loved it so much it was the perfect location. Close to everything. And just great vibes all around. This is a must for anyone traveling to Greece it's just steps away from all the great sights.
14583913,208823200,2017-11-03,75493909,Momo,Very central and easy to go to the airport. Many things around the area making it a great and convenient place to stay. 
14583913,209020890,2017-11-04,72766815,Kate,Evans studio is the perfect spot to stay in Athens. Located in historic Plaka everything is just a few minuets walk away. The view of the acropolis from the terrace is worth its weight In gold. Evan and Anita were both very helpful and communicative which made finding the studio and bus stations nearby that much easier. The check in was perfect they even had suggestions of sights to see on our last leg of our journey in Kalamata. Their passion and enthusiasm for Greece makes it hard to leave. Needless to say we will be back.
14583913,209827240,2017-11-06,138375280,Bianca,Evan ha sido muy majo y muy atento en todo momento. Siempre disponible para responder a los mensajes y nuestras dudas
14583913,210547566,2017-11-10,130746508,Edson Jorge,Bom custo X benefício.
14583913,211527798,2017-11-13,23284103,George,The spot was amazing near the metro station and the most central shop street of Greece!
14583913,212755097,2017-11-19,29119268,Ronan,"Managed to check-in before the normal time to put our luggage in so really useful. Nice view on the Parthenon and the location is ideal for tourist shopping and restaurants.<br/>We didn't get the room with the arcade (it doesn't work we asked :)) as depicted in the picture. We obviously weren't visiting Athens for that so, not that much of a disappointment, but still bitter on the throat hahaha."
14583913,213240064,2017-11-20,86768349,Erin,"This apartment was perfect for seeing Athens. It was walking distance from the metro and many lovely sights- including the Acropolis and Hadrian’s Arch! Many restaurants and cafes right outside the lobby door. On top of its ideal location, the apartment itself is spacious, clean, and cozy. The balcony even has a lovely view of the Acropolis! If my husband and I are ever in Athens again we will definitely stay again."
14583913,214536351,2017-11-26,52235500,Thomas,"Evan's flat is in a central location near a number of cafes, restaurants, and public transit  that leads to Athens airport (X95 or M3). Being on the fifth floor allows for some beautiful views of the Acropolis (15 min walk south) but note that we still heard a fair amount of noise during the evening from the street shops on the ground floor. <br/><br/>Communication with Evan was very prompt from the initial booking until we approached closer to check-in. He was accommodating ( and we are grateful) of our later check-in time since we had flight issues. As such, we did our best to inform him of our flight arrival time and when we expected to be in front of his flat. <br/><br/>We arrived at the entrance of his flat and waited for ten minutes and had not received a response from him since we had initially landed in Athens even though we attempted to text/DM/vmail. This was a little concerning. Shortly afterwards, a woman (Evan's GF/friend?) met us with keys to access the flat and gave us a tour of the space.<br/><br/>Overall, the space was clean and well furnished but the layout may seem a bit odd given the split space design with a waist height wall that divides the floor plan. The overall airbnb was priced fairly given its location and reasonable level of comfort but the level of communication left a bit to be desired towards check-in."
14583913,216503803,2017-12-04,29921529,Dan,"Nice place, very 80's interior, very good position."

14583913,220417772,2017-12-22,10067584,Pooja,The apartment is exactly as described but the location is perfect for a short stay in Athens. And you can't beat the view from the apartment!
14583913,220605780,2017-12-23,35531321,Iliana,"The flat is spacious, clean and the view from the balcony is absolutely amazing...the photos don't really do it justice!! The location is ideal as you can explore the center of Athens on foot.  We absolutely loved it!  We would definitely re-visit."
14583913,221363902,2017-12-26,132674986,Roy,"The place sits perfectly in the centre of Athens and is within walkable distance to lots of tourist attractions including constitution plaza and acropolis. The flat is comfy and stylish and there are plenty of restaurants, bars, and shops in  the neighbourhood. Evan is super friendly and responsive to our queries and needs. It is a must-staty when visiting Athens."

14583913,228549824,2018-01-20,26813325,Sarah,"This was a great place to stay. The location was my favorite part- right in the middle of everything, near the markets, several restaurants and coffee shops, and a quick walk to the acropolis and metro station. <br/><br/>Evan was so helpful when we first got to the city, he met us at a coffee shop when we had trouble finding the address and carried my heavy bag for me. <br/><br/>The only thing was that it was very noisy. Since you are on the street (great for people watching and views), the noise starts very early in the morning- loud trucks and construction before 8am. It was also a little chilly in the room, but there was a space heater that warmed us up. <br/><br/>Make sure you have Evan show you how to work the key and lock! It was very tricky for us at first, but we got the hang of it. <br/><br/>Altogether, this space had a lot of personality and I would definitely stay here again! "
14583913,229181443,2018-01-22,94572856,Panagiotis,My stay in the apartment was excellent and I strongly recommend it. Evan and his cooperators are friendly and directly available for any help. The location of the apartment is in the most central region of the city. The apartment was clean with a lovable view in the Acropolis. I will prefer this apartment for my next visit!

It can get loud on the weekends usually Saturday since partying can go on till late. If you're looking for convenience and a place to crash during a short stay, look no further. Evan was a great host, very accommodating with great communication. I would consider staying here again :)"

The room is excellent, quirky and very modern. As you walk out into the balcony you'll be memorised by Athens bustling yet magical views. The area is ideal for foodies like ourselves, we've experienced unique dishes and everything from this apartment is walkable. Athens will remain close to our heart because of the apartment."

14583913,250730057,2018-04-06,45714160,Willem,"Evan’s place is truly amazing. The location is perfect, close to all highlights, and the balcony view on the Acropolis is absolutely stunning. Although located in a busy street, the sound was no problem whatsoever, I suppose due to good insulation and it being located on the fifth floor. The apartement itself is very well designed and is a fun place. There is no kitchen (or microwave) but that’s no problem with so many (affordable) food options around. Overall ana amazing place and the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at so far. Highly recommended!"
14583913,251488140,2018-04-08,25026570,Claire,"地方位於市中心,非常方便｡走路就到捷運站(metro). 要去古市集,羅馬市集等等古蹟地點都是走路的距離可到｡在陽台還可以看到衛城｡<br/>但如果是開車,這兒有點不方便,需要繞一下才找得到位置,而且希臘停車的規矩很難懂,也沒有一定按照規矩｡<br/><br/>房間很大,很特殊的佈置風格,唯獨廁所很小｡<br/><br/>整理而言,算是很不錯的住宿地點!推薦"

14583913,252342435,2018-04-10,48883657,Sol,Well located with a lot of bars around it in one of the best areas. Installations in the building and apartment need maintanence. We had a terrible experience when arriving: he left the keys at a restaurant and they didn't want to look for the keys and giving them to us although were next to them. The view from the balcony is nice but shared with another room and barely separated. Overall is good.

The accommodations were comfortable and we really liked the neighborhood."
14583913,255300929,2018-04-20,56743580,Ankit,The apartment is located very close to Monastiraki metro station and amidst the best local restaurants in the area. The view of Acropolis from the balcony is astounding. The place is clean and we'll maintained.
14583913,256569194,2018-04-23,148342282,Eduardo,"This place was in a perfect location and had an amazing view of the Pantheon. It's centralized between everything so there's no need to rent a car. It's about 45 minutes to the airport by train or 1 hour by bus. There's restaurants right outside the flat in case you need a late snack like I did. I would definitely go back in a heart beat, highly recommend."

Il bagno è deprimente. Il terzo letto sul divano è piccolo anche per un bambino oltre che scomodo e rumoroso e anche la vista non è che poi sia tutta questa gran cosa."

14583913,260520801,2018-05-04,20824625,Sarah,"Stayed a total of 3 nights at Evan’s place. Two when we first arrived and one after returning from the Greek Islands. <br/><br/>Evan’s place is extremely well located, with a short walk to all major tourist attractions. There is a metro station about 100m away and you can access both the airport and port without changing lines. Its about 40mins from the airport and 25 from the port.  <br/><br/>The place itself was clean and had a lovely view of the Acropolis. There is nothing in the way of cooking facilities but does have a fridge and kettle. There are plenty of restaurants at the doorstep though!! Towels and some bathroom products are also provided. <br/><br/>It is great value for money and we would definitely stay here again."
14583913,261280605,2018-05-06,52831140,Abbey,"Great location! The Greek Wrap restaurant, Tylixto, was right next door and very yummy! Evan's place was very interesting! Definitely adds to our memories. We would stay again. :)"
14583913,266043720,2018-05-19,174854253,Brontee,"Check-out arrangements were awful. There was a lack of communication that resulted in someone, not Evan, opening and coming into our room unannounced while we were in there. The person did not speak any English and shoved a phone in our face so that we could talk to a woman (also not Evan) who was just as confused as we were. We were given 15 minutes to leave the room and pack up our belongings while the random guy stood there watching us. <br/>The location of the apartment is amazing and is close to everything, but the experience of being kicked out of the room made me never want to stay at his place again"
14583913,267586336,2018-05-22,21818193,Robert,"Great, big apartment in a perfect location.  It is right above a pedestrian street with many restaurants and shops, but quiet because it is on the 5th floor (with elevator).  The apartment is clean and comfortable, and has fast WiFi.  Just a 5 minute walk from the Monastiraki metro station, which connects directly to the airport."

14583913,273774853,2018-06-07,15837507,Graham,Evans place was funky and functional. But the outstanding part about it is its location. All the main sights are within easy reach either by walking or via Monistiraki metro station which is around 150m away.  Evan was great and responded really quickly when i had phone problems after our late arrival.       (had to log in to Airbnb via (Hidden by Airbnb) with  free wifi at cafe downstairs  to send a message) Overall a great visit to Athens and great apartment.
14583913,274022885,2018-06-08,188816807,Elisavet,Everything was great! Exactly like we wanted to be! And Evan was really helpful as a host!!

14583913,276526442,2018-06-14,24513973,Brya,The location of this studio is awesome. We were able to walk to everything. The space was as expected but the bed was very uncomfortable...you could feel the springs. Evan was great at communicating and was at the door to meet us when we arrived. The building can be a bit creepy at night...the light was out in our hallway so pitch black. The elevator is also a bit creepy but worked just fine. 
14583913,279577267,2018-06-21,169521267,Claire,"Appartement très propre, en coeur de ville et facilement accessible. Evan est un hôte très professionnel, je recommande !!"

14583913,281967756,2018-06-26,54116776,João,"The location of the apartment is amazing, it is a walking distance to everywhere we needed including the Train to the airport, Acropole, restaurants, everything. The apartment only needs some work like oversll furniture, bathroom and shower, kitchen, also the check in needs to be more organized and precise. Apart from that we loved our stay."

It was the first time to go on a trip to Athens, I was able to get really really great memory at this Evan’s apartment. First I arrived to Athens was really late time, I guess it was midnight, Evan waited me when I arrived at his place and being so kind to explan about the using some studf in the apartment. (Like how can open the balcony’s window, using the hot water...) First, location!!! His apartment located in Armu street, it’s very close to Akropolis and Sintagma so I was able to easy to visit there. It was only 5~7 mints by walk. Other places spent only maximum 10~15 mints by walk too. And there were lots of great restaurants and snack shops. Second, in apartment was very very clean and comfortable. It was bigger place than I thought, so I was able to really comfortable to stay. There is no kitchen but I noticed it already so it didn’t matter. At the outside are lots of restaurants so when I fell hungry just went out and boom! Haha. Third, the view!!! I was able to see the amazing Akropolis view in the balcony so I was able to see amazing view at the each time, sunrise and sunset. But it connects with next other room so it had to close the door. And the last, about the host “Evan”, he was really nice to me. I wasn’t hard to keep in touch with him. The most thankful to him, I had to go to the Mykonos island in the early morning so I needed to get the taxi to get to the airport. He aksed his friend to get there so I was able to get the airport not the late time. I really recommend his apartment to you guys, if you stay his place, I guarantee you’re able to stay so safty, comfortable, and easy to get everywhere. Thank you Evan to make wonderful time!!"
14583913,328390370,2018-09-26,45133839,Lois,"this little flat was in a great spot and would have been for sitting out on the little balcony watching people with a view of the acropolis, had it not been too windy to do so.<br/>check in was easy and the escalator was useful.<br/>it was great for our one night stopover in Athens.  <br/>there was a fridge and a kettle and some cups and glasses.  <br/>if you love retro spaces, you'll love this flat"

14583913,329637728,2018-09-29,169955345,Irene,Evan’s place was a great place to stay in Athens. It’s in a very convenient position and from a certain position on the balcony it had a great view of the Acropolis. We really liked the quirkiness of the apartment and the fact that it was quiet even though it was in the middle of a lot of action on the street level.
14583913,331590938,2018-10-03,57539049,Brittany & Hugo,Evan’s place is in a fantastic location! Just downstairs is a great pedestrian road with restaurants and shops and the view from the balcony was incredible. I definitely recommend this place!
14583913,332774486,2018-10-06,50729079,Maggie,"If I could give more than five stars I would! The value of this place is unbeatable. I would recommend to anyone staying in Athens to stay here. We were walking distance to bars, restaurants, and public transportation. This place gives you the local feeling you hope for when booking an air B and B. Evan’s place is so charming and that view is to die for. Do your self a favor and stay here!"
14583913,333420144,2018-10-07,200989132,Megan,"For the price, the location cannot be beat. The view of the Acropolis and the fun street below were great. Be aware that this apartment is very basic. There is not a kitchen sink and the building itself is very old and a bit rundown. However, if all you need is a convenient base for exploring Athens for a day or two, this is a great spot."
14583913,334801052,2018-10-10,16639169,Joanne,Very good location. Experience a ancient lift up n down. <br/>Definitely value for money and great host in terms of communication. <br/>Evan is very friendly and helped us when we needed to extend our stay. <br/>Thank u! :) <br/><br/>God bless

14583913,353510420,2018-11-28,150362177,Emma,"Well the place itself was great, the host was not. We asked Evan multiple times if we could check in early and he ignored the question(s) and said that he is expecting us and is excited to host us, so we assumed that meant we could since our flight landed early morning in Athens.  So we used his very unhelpful directions to get to the place which was hard to find (he did not even mention it was in a shop) we arrived at his place and messaged him and he did not respond for 3 1/2 hours leaving us to lug our suitcases around Athens. If he had said the check in time was strict 3pm it would’ve been completely fine. Once he sent us the check in information he gave us the WRONG information leaving us to check in and shower in the wrong unit....other than the horrible check in and communication Evans place was very clean and in a great spot in central Athens."

Amazing big bed with heating (must have at winter times) and really welcoming hosts. So we had a great time there! The only thing missing is some kind of kitchen:)

The apartment was spotlessly clean with a comfy bed. Communication was very easy and Evan was really friendly and flexible when our arrival ended up delayed. The perfect AirBnb experience - we will be back :)

14583913,429824218,2019-03-29,120626748,Stratos,The apartment is on 5th floor with amazing view of Acropolis. It’s very quiet with no traffic noise or the noise of a big city despite the fact that it’s in the center of Athens in a very convenient area. Everything you need is 1 min walking.<br/><br/>The internal decoration is very modern as well.<br/><br/>Apartment suitable for couples.
14583913,430731267,2019-03-31,75965445,Benjamin,This is definetly the place to stay during your time in athens. The view on the acropolis is breathtaking and everything is within walking distance. Check-In and communication as easy as could be. I absolutely recommend this accommodation!

14583913,439453523,2019-04-19,87327371,Heidi,The latest guys may take a while to load. And the bathroom is quite cramped. But the extra decorations and arcade machine made the room very cool. Note that the wall is actually cut out so it’s actually one big room

Enter the neighbourhood of this amazing spot right out of the station and delve into the lively spot of Monastiraki square. Ancient ruins are around every corner, along with Greek cuisine (have to get the Saganaki!) cooking at every outdoor patio, you'll never get enough of this apartments area. The room is great - a view of Lycabettus right from the bed + the Parthenon peaking at you from the balcony. Be sure to hangout here at night for a stunning night time illumination of the Acropolis! There is also a nice sized fridge, where we stored fresh fruits from the market and water bottles for our travels. Enjoy your stay here! We certainly did!"

Thanks!"
14583913,476913367,2019-06-27,263795288,Dianne,Very convenient location but this does come with high noise levels until 2-3am. The air conditioning unit was extremely noisy and inefficient so we battled to sleep with the doors open and the mosquitoes.... no fly screens. Hot water not great. No kitchen but has a fridge and a kettle.

14583913,486272030,2019-07-12,45841689,Elias,"This is a lovely place to explore the city from. It has a superb location in the centre and close to everything you could want to see. The place itself was neat and clean, although the bathroom is quite small. The one thing we didn't like was the airconditioning as it was not functioning properly yet necessary in Greek summer time."

14583913,500341976,2019-08-02,6561089,Abigail,"Anetta & Evan's place is located in an amazing part of Athens, and has an incredible view! If it is especially hot, you'll want to make sure the air conditioning has been repaired, as it didn't work for us and we couldn't sleep at all because of the heat (we're used to living without A/C, but this was especially rough since there is no fan). Otherwise great though - super easy check-in and a fun area."

The place is indeed urban styled and has a great view of the mighty Acropolis from the balcony. Many eateries, including Starbucks, are nearby. BTW, Monastiraki is connected by metro to both the seaport (green line) & the airport (blue line). They have been very well in replying to queries. All you need for a decent stay is right here. :)"

Es hat keine Küche,  aber Kühlschrank und Wasserkocher.  Und einen Balkon mit wunderschöner Aussicht auf die Akropolis. Ein Traum.  <br/><br/>Die Einrichtung ist recht retro aber praktisch.  Zum Glück existiert eine aircon,  denn es kann sehr heiß werden. Kleine Restaurants und Cafe sind direkt in der Straße,  so dass man überall Frühstück oder Snacks bekommen kann. Alles easy,  auch die Kommunikation und Schlüsselübergabe hat super geklappt.  Danke!"

14583913,536188512,2019-09-26,121580276,DeAnna,"When planning your trip to Greece, Evan’s place is the place to stay! The view of the hilltop from the apartment is spectacular!  The location to all of the historic sites, restaurants and stores you could possibly need are just a few steps away.  Evan was always available and would check in on me to make sure I had everything I needed. At night I would leave the window open so I could hear the incredible energy of locals celebrating life. The next time I visit Greece Evan’s place is where I will stay.  Thank you Evan for providing the perfect place to truly experience Athens and Greek culture!"

14583913,537693633,2019-09-29,10575742,Melanie,"AMAZING location and view of the Acropolis. This place it worth it just for the proximity to great cafes, restaurants, and walking distance to everything you'd want. The actual apartment feels like a bachelor's pad and is very basic (the shower is a little miserable if you're tall). I wouldn't recommend more and 2 people stay here as it's a Queen bed and a pull out twin. <br/>Evan was super helpful on restaurant recos and always fast to reply. I recommend staying here if you're ok with a no frills, basic spot. Overall, I recommend it and appreciate Evan's hospitality."
